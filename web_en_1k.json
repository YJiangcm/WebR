Only 2% of people in Britain belong to a credit union. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian\nRupert Jones\nThe low-income customers of Britain's credit unions could face paying more for their loans after a government-commissioned report concluded the sector is \"not financially sustainable\".\nA rise in the maximum annual interest rate that people can be charged for a credit union loan from 26% to 42% is a key recommendation in the report, which also calls for more government cash to be invested in the sector.\nThere are 400 credit unions in Britain, with more than 950,000 members, and they are seen as offering a vital alternative to banks, expensive payday lenders and loan sharks. But the report, commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions, warned that without additional government money, many could close.\nCredit unions are huge in countries such as Ireland, the US and Australia, but have not taken off in a big way in the UK, where just 2% of people belong to one. Their progress has been hindered by restrictions that have limited take-up, but new rules were introduced this year designed to enable them to compete more effectively. For the first time, credit unions are able to pay people interest on their savings, and they no longer have to demonstrate that all those joining the union have something in common.\nThe report was commissioned to look at possible ways of increasing the numbers of people who use credit unions. It found there was a potential market of at least 7 million people for the services that credit unions could deliver. Many of them currently fall into the trap of high-cost credit, with some being charged more than 6,000% in interest on short-term loans by \"predatory\" lenders, according to the government.\nThe study's authors said credit unions have been helping to provide affordable credit to those on low incomes, but added: \"Their operating costs are relatively high, and they are not financially sustainable at present.\" Many rely on grant income from the DWP and other bodies, such as local authorities and social landlords, but these sources of funding are likely to come under even greater pressure in the future.\nThe report proposes that the DWP should provide \u00a351m of funding for a modernisation and expansion programme. One option would be for the government to do nothing, but the authors say of this scenario: \"Given the current funding landscape, it is likely many individual credit unions will face severe financial difficulty, and pressure from the Financial Services Authority to reduce their loss-making business or close.\"\nCredit unions frequently offer best-buy rates for people looking to borrow smaller sums as, by law, they cannot charge more than 2% interest a month on the amount owed - an APR of 26.8%. They are the only financial institutions in the UK to have such a cap on interest rates. The 2% limit \"does not allow even the most cost-effective to break even on smaller loans at present,\" said the report, which called for an increase to 3% a month - equating to an APR of 42%.\nSomeone who borrows \u00a3400 over one year at a rate of 2% a month would currently be charged a total of \u00a354 interest. If the rate rose to 3%, that individual would pay \u00a382 in interest. However, the report stated: \"This still compares very favourably to the interest of more than \u00a3300 that would be charged on a similar \u00a3400 loan from a leading home credit lender. In hard cash terms, the cost to the consumer of increasing the rate to 3% per calendar month on a \u00a3400 loan would be just over 50 pence per week.\"\nLord Freud, the welfare minister, said: \"For too long, predatory lenders have been plaguing the homes of vulnerable people, who often have no other way to get cash when they need it most. I welcome this study - it offers expert advice on helping credit unions grow and modernise to meet the needs of vulnerable people in the 21st century.\""

        "webpage": "Unemployment and employment statistics\nSlashing the budget deficit will have a dire effect on the north\nGeorge Osborne's budget cuts will lead to grinding unemployment in places dependent on the public sector\nLarry Elliott\nGiven that he was announcing a six-year programme of spending cuts unprecedented in the modern era, George Osborne said little in his budget speech about unemployment. Now we know why.\nOver the next five years, the Treasury believes that at least 2,000 jobs a week are to go from the public sector and up to 2,800 a week from the private sector as a direct result of the planned spending cuts. So much for the idea that the coalition government is taking a surgical knife to a bloated state, creating the space for an unshackled private sector to take up the slack. The private sector will face a double whammy: work from the public sector will dry up, while the loss of so many public jobs will have a ripple effect through the private sector. Those parts of the country heavily dependent on the public sector, anywhere north of a line from the Wash to the Severn estuary, the impact threatens to be dire.\nOsborne's argument is that he has no choice but to take drastic action; but, apart from the supposed need to appease the bond markets, there is no economic rationale for slashing the budget deficit in the way being planned.\nFirst, there is no evidence that the public sector is \"crowding\" out investment in the private sector. On the contrary, it has only been the demand from the public sector that has prevented the economy sliding into an even bigger hole over the past two years. The chancellor seems to believe that taking the axe to the deficit will lead to a spontaneous recovery in the animal spirits of firms, who will respond by investing more, exporting more, and taking on more workers. This seems improbable, not least because the \"crowding in\" of the private sector would require a big and permanent reduction in interest rates. But both short-term rates (those set by the Bank of England) and long-term rates (set in the bond markets) are already at historically low levels.\nSecond, the climate for job creation is poor and likely to remain so. Britain's biggest export market, the euro area, is moribund, while the US, which hitherto has rebounded more quickly than Europe from recession, appears to be running out of steam. Bank credit is available, but only at a price, and on conditions businesses consider too onerous. As a result, investment is weak. Consumers swallowed pay cuts and pay freezes in order to safeguard jobs: now it appears more than a million jobs are going to be lost anyway. The temptation for households to save rather than spend will be mightily strong over the next few years.\nThird, the attempt to appease the markets may prove counter-productive, as big sell-off in share prices on both sides of the Atlantic showed. The plunge was caused, not by concerns over a sovereign debt crisis, but because of a sharp fall in US consumer confidence. Having panicked governments, including ours, into crash deficit reduction, the markets are now worried about the impact on growth. All of which shows it is dumb to allow the financial markets to dictate policy.\nIn Britain's case, that means spending cuts on a scale that will exceed both in scale and duration those imposed by the International Monetary Fund between 1976 and 1982. Yet, unless the next few years throw up a source of job creation as yet unidentified, the impact of this budget will be depressingly similar. Think 1980s. Think Boys from the Black Stuff.

        "webpage": "Credit Unions Maintain Lead in Financial Services but Drop in Customer Satisfaction\nDecember 11, 2012 \u2022 Reprints When it comes to financial services, credit unions continued to remain best in class despite scoring a drop in overall customer satisfaction - but still high enough to beat out the banks.\nAccording to the American Customer Satisfaction Index released Tuesday, customer satisfaction with credit unions fell 5.7% to an ACSI score of 82, which surpassed the overall score for banks at 77. Credit unions also experienced a drop in 2010 before bouncing back to a record high of 87% in 2011.\nThe ACSI rates companies at the national level and measures customer satisfaction across 10 economic sectors, 47 industries including e-commerce and e-business and more than 230 companies and federal or local government agencies on a 100-point scale.\nAlthough customer satisfaction with credit unions declined, the ACSI said the industry remains best in class for financial services and displays the top customer satisfaction benchmark among all service categories covered in the ACSI.\nMoreover, credit unions continue to do better than small banks in customer satisfaction, while outperforming all of the big banks by a wide margin, according to the ACSI.\n\"Like small banks, credit unions offer more personalized service and fewer fees. This year, however, an influx of new clients causes credit unions to retreat from their past lofty standards for customer service,\" the ACSI index noted.\nStill, because of a change toward more fees and higher minimum balance requirements, the ACSI said this could be worrisome given the industry's weaker customer service this year.\n\"The large influx of new customers for credit unions, many of whom left banks because of rising fees, poses new challenges for customer service,\" said Claes Fornell, ACSI founder. \"The question becomes how to best serve a fast-growing customer franchise. The more customers you have, the more difficult it gets.\"\nMeanwhile, banks have improved their customer satisfaction score since last year from 75 to 77. The ACSI said the higher score is mostly the result of continued high customer satisfaction with smaller banks, which have gained market share and therefore impact the industry average more in 2012. Smaller banks, defined as those banks outside of the big four of Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, scored 79.\nThe other improvement factor for banks is a 6% increase in customer satisfaction for JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank. JPMorgan Chase leads big banks with a score of 74, but still trails the small banks, which tend to offer more personalized service, free checking, and lower fees, according to the index.\nOther big banks have had to deal with deteriorating customer satisfaction, the ACSI discovered. Compared to 2011's figures, Wells Fargo slid 3% to 71 and Citigroup retreated 4% to 70. Bank of America dropped 3% to 66, reaching its lowest level of customer satisfaction in over a decade, the data showed.\n\"The total fees from overdraft charges alone in 2011, most of them from big banks, amounted to more than $30 billion,\" Fornell said. \"Customers increasingly are rejecting the ever-mounting fees charged by large banks and taking their business to credit unions instead.\"\nFornell said Bank of America, in particular, stands out as the only bank that is still below its prerecession customer satisfaction level.\n\"It is clear that this is mostly because of fees. Customer satisfaction was probably set to deteriorate further as additional fees were in the making until a few weeks ago, when BoA backed away from the idea,\" Fornell noted. Show Comments"

Is this possible?A: No, not really. It's interesting that your friend made this comparison because it's almost possible to consistently predict which horse will win a race. But it's a lot harder to pick a winner in the stock market because there are thousands to choose from.Yet, unlike their experience at the track, stock investors can benefit from the performance of few winners - if they put their money in passively managed funds linked to the performance of stocks in certain indexes of the market, such as the S&P 500. This is because these indexes' performance can be buoyed by the performance of a few winning stocks. For every high-performing stock, there are hundreds that lag far behind. Those who invest broadly in the market, owning thousands of companies via index type funds, can benefit from the way high-fliers boost overall market performance. Between 1983 and 2008, the Russell 3000 index (representing nearly 100 percent of the entire market) posted average returns of nearly 10 percent annually - a whopping total return of more than 1,000 percent. Yet during this same 25-year period, about 64 percent of all the stocks actually underperformed the Russell 3000 What saved this index? The winning 10 percent, which soared in value more than 500 percent. Of course, things don't work the same way at the track. Unlike the market, where you can invest in thousands of companies via an index fund, the track forces you to gamble by attempting to pick winners. Active money managers - those who speculate by attempting to pick outperforming stocks for mutual funds or clients' portfolios - persist in attempting to defy the overwhelming odds against them. What's most unfortunate is that in spite of overwhelming academic research and evidence against this, individuals, families and institutions continue to invest with these speculating managers. Attempting to consistently outperform the markets by picking winners is simply a mathematical long shot. Sure, some get lucky on occasion, but as the evidence clearly demonstrates, according to Standard & Poor's research, the results are actually less successful than could be expected from picking stocks at random. The difficulty of choosing winners in advance consistently and chronically is demonstrated not just by the Russell 3000 performance over 25 years, but by other indexes over much longer periods. One widely regarded total market index that goes back to the 1920s returned an average of nearly 10 percent annually from then through 2009. But without the top 10 percent performers, the return would only have been about six percent. If you excluded the top 25 percent performers, the index's return for this period would have been in negative territory.This long look back at market history shows the perils of trying to pick stocks and why it's a losers game - compared with just hitching a ride on the market bus and letting the few great stocks, that are all but impossible to consistently choose in advance, more than make up for the laggard majority. What's more, by investing this way, you'll save a lot of worry and energy by having the odds on your side instead of against you. It's as if the winning horses at the track were pulling the losers closer to the finish line to improve the average time of the entire field. Of course, this is a gambler's fantasy.Yet, because of passive investing (like index funds), this dynamic does indeed exist in the stock market, and you can benefit from it significantly over time. Quite simply, since this opportunity does exist, why would you ever want to invest differently when you have about at one in five chance of winning?So don't gamble with your hard-earned money. If you're going to gamble and usually lose, at least have some fun at the race track yourself by trying to pick a winning thoroughbred.

        "webpage": "News | Vermont News Forecast is for slow economic growth in region\nBy BOB SALSBERGThe Associated Press | December 06,2012\nBOSTON \ufffd Sluggish economic growth will continue in New England, with much of the region not seeing a return to pre-recession employment levels until 2015 at the earliest, according to a forecast released Wednesday.The four-year forecast developed by the New England Economic Partnership suggests that Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire will fare best over that period, while Rhode Island\ufffds unemployment rate will remain the highest in the region. Maine and Connecticut will also struggle to reach pre-recession job levels by the end of 2016, the economists said. The forecast sees average employment growth of 1.5 percent for the entire six-state region and average overall economic growth of 3.3 percent over the four-year period. The economists said 2 percent growth would be needed to make a significant dent in unemployment. The conclusions stem from the likelihood that the global economy will continue to sputter for the foreseeable future. New England has already experienced a disproportionate drop in exports to Europe.The forecast also hinges on one key assumption.\ufffdThis assumes, of course, that we are not going to fly over the fiscal cliff, that there will be some agreement to keep us from experiencing the worst parts of that,\ufffd said Alan Clayton-Matthews, a Northeastern University economist.But if President Barack Obama and Congress fail to broker a deal by Dec. 31 to stave off tax increases and massive spending cuts, New England will suffer harsher consequences than the nation as a whole, the economists said. In fact, according to an analysis by Moody\ufffds Analytics, four New England states \ufffd Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island \ufffd would be among the seven hardest-hit states if the nation goes over the fiscal cliff, and all six states in the region would be among the top 20 in expected job losses. The primary reason for this, the economists said, is that the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts would have a greater impact on New England because of its relatively high per capita income. The consortium of regional economists, which planned to formally present its findings at a conference of the business-backed New England Council on Thursday, pointed to wide variances in the forecast on a state-by-state basis. \ufffdMassachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire are expected to recover their jobs lost during the recession period and add jobs by the end of our forecast period,\ufffd said Ross Gittell, a University of New Hampshire economist and the partnership\ufffds forecast manager.The same was not true for other states. \ufffdRhode Island had the most significant employment decline, and it\ufffds going to take longer to recover,\ufffd Gittell said. \ufffdMaine didn\ufffdt have as significant an employment decline as Rhode Island or a couple of the other states ... but Maine\ufffds economy is very flat and showing no growth.\ufffdConnecticut may return to pre-recession job levels by 2016, but just barely, Gittell added.Housing was a bright spot in the forecast, with economists citing increases in both sales activity and median prices in most of the region. Vermont and Massachusetts were expected to see the sharpest rises in median housing prices over the next four years, Rhode Island and New Hampshire the lowest."

        "webpage": "Guest Blog: Rep. Ed Royce on Dodd-Frank, One Year Later\nRep. Ed Royce / July 21, 2011\nUpon passage of the financial reform bill, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said, \"This is the next critical step forward in an effort to rebuild our economy.\" This type of political hubris is reminiscent of what economist Friedrich Hayek referred to as the fatal conceit. Unemployment still stands above 9 percent, business confidence is in the tank and economic growth remains stagnant. As flawed as their claims may sound today, it is important to illustrate exactly where Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Frank and their allies failed so mightily one year ago. Let's start with the most obvious:\nThe authors said it would address the causes of the 2008 crisis. From its inception, this reform effort was meant to fit an ideological narrative rather than address shortcomings in our regulatory structure. Let us not forget the financial crisis had its roots in the decision by Congress to embark on a course of social justice to get everyone that wanted a home into one regardless of whether or not they could afford it. Over the years, that flawed effort led to the creation of 27 million subprime and other risky loans (representing roughly half of all U.S. mortgages). The most popular conduit for this social justice policy quickly became the two government sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were conveniently left out of the reform effort enacted last year.\nThe authors said it would eliminate \"Too Big to Fail.\" With a now popular book and movie bearing this title, Too Big to Fail has become a focal point of the 2008 crisis. Unfortunately, despite the attention it has received, Dodd-Frank compounded rather than eliminated Too Big to Fail. Most Dodd-Frank supporters point to the new Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) as a means to mitigating Too Big to Fail. Yet, as Standard & Poor's recently noted, \"future extraordinary government support is still possible\" under this authority (i.e. the bailouts will keep coming). S&P's report hit on an important point with respect to the government and these behemoth institutions; in times of crisis regulators will always err on the side of more intervention and more bailouts. Dodd-Frank's OLA simply makes this process easier. As a result, the largest institutions will continue to benefit from the implicit government support, which translates into lower borrowing costs. These goliaths will get bigger while their Too Small to Save competitors will fall by the wayside.\nThe market confirms this account. Pre-crisis, the top 10 banks in the U.S. held 55% of total assets in the sector; today its 77%. Much of this has been driven by that funding advantage over smaller competitors (which economists say ranges from 70 basis points to over 100 basis points). Conversely, experts have speculated that the number of small institutions will be halved over the next decade because they do not benefit from the perceived government backstop implicit in Dodd-Frank.\nThe authors said it would benefit the economy. At $1.25 billion over the next year, the actual budgetary cost to the government seems manageable. The Congressional Budget Office estimates over the next decade, $27 billion will be taken from the economy in new fees and assessments. Unfortunately, because Washington is notoriously bad at gauging the actual economic impact of its policies, only time will reveal the final price tag. Take the last major financial reform effort, Sarbanes-Oxley. At the time, the SEC estimated that internal costs (exclusive of audit fees) of Section 404 would average $91,000 per company. Subsequent studies have shown that the true cost is on the order of $3.5 million per company - more than 35 times the SEC's estimate. With 387 sets of rules Dodd-Frank is exponentially larger than Sarbanes-Oxley. I'll let you decide what that means in terms of overall costs.\nNow more than ever, thanks to efforts like Dodd-Frank, the drivers of our economy are increasingly focused inward. Rather than looking to finance the next Google or Microsoft, businesses will be mired in complying with 2,300 pages of flawed rules and regulations. From the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with its half-billion dollar budget and virtually no accountability or oversight, to the new derivatives regulation, 'compliance' with ever-changing dictates will consume these firms. If the end result was a more stable financial system, this may be a cost worth bearing. Unfortunately, every indication points in the opposite direction; a fundamentally weaker financial system and a less vibrant economy. This is not an anniversary worth celebrating.\nU.S. Representative Ed Royce (R-CA) is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and sat on the Dodd Frank Conference Committee one year ago.\nThe views expressed by guest bloggers on the Foundry do not necessarily reflect the views of The Heritage Foundation."

        "webpage": "Bridge the divide\nOne of the biggest mysteries of the 2012 race for the White House was the notion that President Barack Obama had offered little clue about what he would do in a second term, especially on voters' No. 1 concern: the economy.\nIn fact, he provided plenty of detail on his website, in printed materials and during the debates with Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Nor was this campaign the first time the president had laid out his long-term vision for rebuilding the economy.\nIn April 2009, only 12 weeks after taking office, Mr. Obama delivered a speech at Georgetown University in which he spelled out his \"larger vision of America's future-a future where sustained economic growth creates good jobs and rising incomes (and) where prosperity is fueled not by excessive debt, reckless speculation, and fleeing profit, but is instead built by skilled, productive workers (and) by sound investments that will spread opportunity at home.\"\nThe \"new foundation\" he aimed to build would have five pillars: new rules for Wall Street; new investments in education, renewable energy and technology, and in health care; and a return to fiscal discipline-including entitlement reform-once the economy recovered fully from the Great Recession.\nThe president's achievements so far on these goals are arguable-and he acknowledged in the 2009 speech that \"we will not finish (this new foundation) in one year; we will not finish it in many\"-but his focus has been remarkably steady.\nExit polls on Election Day showed that most voters believed Mr. Obama understood their concerns and deserved more time to pull the economy out of the hole dug before he took office. They also voiced support for his approach to dealing with daunting fiscal issues.\nYet the narrow margin of the popular vote also sent a warning: The election is no sweeping mandate.\nPost-election, what most Americans truly want seems strikingly obvious: a willingness by both Republicans and Democrats to compromise-to find common ground on the economy, taxes and spending, and other critical issues facing the country.\nSince the Rochester region is a microcosm of the nation, with its congressional representation split in two, there's no better place to start demonstrating the ability to work together, which voters rightfully expect."

Watch the Did-You-Know slideshow\nOsmand Vitez\nEconomic value analysis is a wealth metric companies use as opposed to accounting income or profit. The most common analysis tool for this process is economic value added, a standard form created several years ago. The use of economic formulas to value a company helps stakeholders determine the true physical value of a business. In short, the balance sheet is often the more important financial statement than the income statement. Consultants are often necessary to help a company complete economic value analysis.\nAccounting is a method companies use to keep score, tracking the movement of dollars in the company. The higher the dollars  -  in terms of profit  -  the better the score for the business in the current market. The biggest issue here, however, is that accounting profit is simply a made-up number. It only represents the difference between sales revenue, cost of goods sold, and expenses, with the final figure having no physical representation. A company's true wealth can only be measured from the use of economic value analysis. Ad\nNo single formula exists to compute a company's economic wealth. A basic formula may be total assets less total liabilities; the difference is the actual wealth a company retains for itself. Other formulas or metrics may apply to other parts of the physical assets of the business. In fact, a company's economic wealth as determined by economic value analysis may be closely related to its market value. The market value of a company is often the figure that a willing party would buy the company for in the open market.\nCash flow is typically a big part of a company's economic value analysis. Not only is cash king in business, but it is also the biggest wealth factor a company generates through normal operations. Economic profit uses cash flow as its primary measurement tool for keeping score. Discounted cash flow models, net present value formulas, and free cash flow all work their way into economic value analysis. Those who compute economic profit or wealth attempt to value all cash flows in current value to assess a company's true value.\nIt can be difficult for a company to accurately assess its economic wealth on its own. The formulas used may be foreign to internal stakeholders, or the processes are simply too complex to figure out without proper education. Consultants can help take an objective look at a company and use the proper formulas for economic value analysis. Consultants may also have benchmarks so they can compare one company's performance against another. Either way, the objective look can provide a true figure for economic wealth.

        "webpage": "When a purchase involves both cash and stock, buyer and seller beware\nGuest Voices By SEAN SAARI\nLinkedIn Google+ Sean Saari is a senior manager in Skoda Minotti's Valuation and Litigation Advisory Services group. He focuses his practice in the areas of valuation, litigation advisory services, complex damages analysis and modeling, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic planning.\nWe are all familiar with the phrase \"cash is king.\" Why is it, though, that cash is crowned king and not real estate, bonds or LeBron James?It all boils down to the fact that everyone can agree to the value of a dollar bill without dispute  -  $1 is worth $1. Someone cannot reasonably argue that a dollar bill is really worth $1.10 or 90 cents.As a result, investors typically prefer to receive cash when selling an ownership interest in a business. It is not uncommon, however, for an acquirer to pay part of the purchase price of an acquisition with its own stock.In the case of a privately held acquirer, the value of its stock is somewhat subjective and there can be reasonable arguments for what one person perceives as being valued at $1 per share being worth 70 cents or $1.40. You get the idea. As a result, it is imperative that both the acquirer and the target in a transaction have support for, and a level of comfort with, the value assigned to the acquirer's shares if they are issued as part of the deal.There is risk on both sides of a transaction when a privately held company is issuing shares as a component of deal consideration. The buyer has an incentive to overvalue its stock and issue fewer shares to the seller, which results in the seller not receiving sufficient compensation for its company. The seller, on the other hand, has an incentive to undervalue the acquirer's stock in an effort to receive more shares and greater ownership percentage, which results in the buyer overpaying. As you can see, there are competing interests that can heighten the incentives for, and the likelihood of, overpayment or underpayment.Another factor that must be considered is that shares in a privately held company are typically subject to a meaningful lack of marketability discount, which may be greater than 30% of the acquiring company's undiscounted value. This discount takes into account the fact that a minority owner in a privately held company cannot readily turn his or her ownership interest into cash (unlike an investment in a publicly traded company). If this discount is not considered when assigning value to the acquirer's shares, it can result in the seller receiving less value than he or she would have had all of the proceeds been paid in cash.The impact of discounts for lack of marketability can extend to shares of publicly traded companies issued in connection with acquisitions as well. We have seen instances in which the sellers in a transaction received restricted stock of the publicly traded acquirer. The restrictions did not permit the sale of the shares for periods ranging from a few months to a few years, which makes the shares less valuable than they would be if they were freely tradable from day one. Imagine receiving shares of a publicly traded company worth $5 million on the date of issuance and watching them decline to $1 million prior to the restricted sale period elapsing. As a result, it is appropriate to consider a discount for lack of marketability for restricted shares in publicly traded companies, as well, to capture the risk associated with potential changes in the price of the acquiring company's shares before the restricted sale period has ended.While acquirers go to great lengths to reduce their risks when purchasing a company, it is still very much a \"buyer beware\" world  -  hence the amount of time spent on due diligence before a transaction closes. When shares of the acquiring company are being issued as a portion of the deal consideration in an acquisition, however, the seller also must beware. In these cases, it is essential that both the buyer and seller accurately value the acquirer's shares, or one party may be left with something worth far less than what it thought it bargained for."

With the proper foundations in place and a sense of direction, there would be no limit to what the organization could accomplish. Augustus was a man who by temperament proceeded cautiously in nearly everything he did. His two favorite sayings were festina lente (make haste slowly) and sat celeriter fieri quidquid fiat satis bene (that which has been done well has been done quickly enough). In both his public and his private lives Augustus was guided by a very practical point of view toward just about every problem he encountered. The Roman Empire when Augustus took over had been pulled apart by decades of infighting among key officials. After the murder of Caesar in 44 BC, the resulting civil wars lasted for nearly fifteen years. No part of the Mediterranean, from Spain and North Africa to Egypt and Asia Minor, was left untouched. When the fighting was over, only Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, known in history as Augustus, was left standing. Augustus (63 BC - AD 14) straddled two important periods, the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire-a time of political, economic, and religious transformation. Perhaps the most significant figure in Roman history, he captured power in a period of turmoil, succeeded in reviving and reforming a fractured political system, and then led the Romans forward into a new and prosperous age. Rome's \"first among equals\" (primus inter pares), as Augustus modestly referred to himself, was not a conqueror and warrior in the style of Cyrus, Alexander, or Caesar; he was an administrator. While visiting the mausoleum of Alexander the Great in Egypt, he commented that conquest is the easy and glamorous part of empire building; keeping it together and directing it is the hard part. Augustus consolidated what Caesar had conquered and through reform and competent administration established for Rome an empire that would dominate the ancient world for centuries. The same principle by which Augustus managed Rome holds true for any business today. If the foundations are secure and if leaders have a clear vision, a company has an excellent chance to succeed. Otherwise, it is likely to become stuck in a routine and stagnate. Look at banks, Wall Street investment houses, and brokerage firms. From the late 1920s to the early 1960s, they were stodgy outfits with short workdays. Technology and innovation upended this cozy world. Countless Wall Street firms from that era folded or were submerged. By contrast, John Chambers of Cisco Systems and Larry Ellison of Oracle work relentlessly to change and expand their high-tech firms. Hurry Up, But Take Your Time and Do it Carefully Alfred Sloan, who made General Mills a behemoth in the auto industry and a corporation admired around the world for its success and longevity, and Augustus were kindred spirits. In the early 1920s, General Motors was a poorly run, ramshackle collection of auto companies and nearly bankrupt. At the time, Ford Motor Company was the dominant player in the auto world, with over 50 percent of market share in the United States. No one else in the industry could manufacture a car as cheaply as Henry Ford could put out the Model T or market it more effectively. The Du Pont family invested heavily in General Motors and installed Sloan as president with a mandate to turn it around. Sloan had become president of his father's ball bearing company in 1899 at the age of twenty-four and ran the company successfully for seventeen years before selling it to William Durant, the founder of General Motors. Sloan had watched General Motors fail and was convinced that mismanagement was the problem. He developed some strong ideas about how the various pieces of th"

Part of his research, he told me, is taking a deep, hard look at the role language plays in helping -- or hurting -- economies around the world.\n\"When you go into Barnes & Noble (BKS) and look for self-help books in English, you see three aisles. But in French, there are almost none,\" he said. That's not because the French are any less self-obsessed than Americans, or even because you are in a U.S. bookstore. Rather, it's because fewer people speak French -- which makes it tougher for businesses to fill niche categories like francophone self-help.\n\"No publisher can make money selling such small topics,\" Parker said.\nSo a decade or so ago, Parker began researching and diagramming the thinking behind language, with an eye toward using computers to automate the creation of print, audio and video content and altering those depressing economics.\nAnd so far, so good. He's developed several marvelous automatic content tools, including an on-demand weather information translation system used in dozens of languages in Africa and India, as well as a self-writing poetry engine called Toto Poetry . Back in 2007, he was even awarded a patent for the process of creating, producing and marketing audio, video and print material without all the pesky people. And what does this machine-learning brain bug have to say about what passes for financial report writing and scholarship here on Wall Street?\n\"Most of what economists do is very formulaic by nature,\" he said. \"We're getting to the point where we can diagram, program and automate much of it.\" That's right, friends, the age of the RoboAnalyst is at hand.\nRoboAnalyst says \"Buy!\" For Parker, it's not a question of if human investors will rely less on human analysis, it's how much they already do. Mimicking the mind of analysts to extend their reach, while not exactly trivial, is not exactly rocket science either.\n\"The big trick is to realize that what we call a report is not a report, but a series of diagrammable subgenres like chapters, sections, paragraphs or whatever,\" he said. \"And once you get to that last subgenre, you've written a formula.\" It's a process Parker says is well within the reach of larger enterprises and investing firms and, more and more, even the rank-and-file investor."

        "webpage": "Economics, Once Again\nThe U.S. Census Bureau has come out with some new findings on the incomes of  nation's median household income rose last year for the first time since 1999, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.Median household income climbed 1.1% to $46,326 in 2005. That means half of U.S. households earned more and half earned less. Per capita income rose 1.5% to $25,036, the Census Bureau said.The income jump hid some somber news. Earnings actually fell for people working full-time. Household income rose because more people worked in the households, albeit at lower paying jobs. Median earnings of men declined 1.8% last year. For women, the decline was 1.3%.A few comments on all this: The median incomes for households rose because more people were working, not because wages and salaries would have risen. Instead, they decreased, but the effect of this decrease was swamped by the effect of more workers. Note also that both men's and women's earnings declined, but men's earnings declined more. This will show up as a reduction in the gender gap in earnings, but the reason for the decrease is not an especially joyful one. Men still suffer more from outsourcing and the losses of better paying blue-collar occupations.If you read the USAToday link to this story you will find a table of income and poverty figures by state. Note that the poorest states are the most wingnutty in their politics. This is one of those great paradoxes.What about poverty in general, then? What has happened to the percentage of Americans regarded as poor? Here's a partial answer:In the world's biggest economy, one in eight Americans and almost one in four blacks lived in poverty last year, the U.S. Census Bureau said on Tuesday, both ratios virtually unchanged from 2004.The survey also showed 15.9 percent of the population, or 46.6 million, had no health insurance, up from 15.6 percent in 2004 and an increase for a fifth consecutive year, even as the economy grew at a 3.2 percent clip.It was the first year since President George W. Bush took office in 2001 that the poverty rate did not increase. As in past years, the figures showed poverty especially concentrated among blacks and Hispanics.In all, some 37 million Americans, or 12.6 percent, lived below the poverty line, defined as having an annual income around $10,000 for an individual or $20,000 for a family of four. The total showed a decrease of 90,000 from the 2004 figure, which Census Bureau officials said was \"statistically insignificant.\"The answer is partial, because these statistics don't include the value of certain government benefits (such as Food Stamps and Medicaid or Medicare payments) while calculating poverty rates, and also partial in the sense that economists always argue about how to measure poverty best. For example, if we used an absolute measure of poverty (something to do with getting the minimum nutrition one needs to survive, perhaps), almost all Americans would be counted among the fairly affluent. But the measure we normally employ is a relative measure of property, telling us how some people do in comparison to the rest of the society.Looking at the incomes of working Americans is important but not the whole economic story here. What has happened to the different ways of making a living? Consider, for example, the division of our national income cake between people who are wage earners and those whose income comes from investments. Though many people get income from both work and investments, the very rich tend to derive most of their incomes from the latter and the very poor, if not on welfare, from the former. So this graph (via a diary on Kos) is  on the graph to see a larger version. What it is telling us is that the American cake is sliced into fairy unequal wedges these days, and that the slices iced with the word \"profit\" are bigger and more luscious. And what does this mean in terms of the 2006 elections? Hard to tell, given the tendency for the U.S. to have the best democracy money can buy.\nSaturday Night Radical Emily Dickinson Blogging\nA Mystery From the Time When Abortion Was Illegal ...\nWe Can Change It\nWhy The Election Is All Important For the Next Two...\nEating The Loaf A Slice At A Time Is Better Than S...\nUnentitled\nWeekend Blogging\nEchidne the Mythbuster!\nThe Rarity of Republicans\nIdle Thoughts on News About Women and Girls\nKeith Olberman's Speech\nYou Can Never Be Too Thin....\nYou Don't Introduce A New Product Line Until After...\nThe Boys' Judicial Treehouse?\nWhat I Want To Know\nPoetry in Translation\nKatrina - One Year Later\nBlogger Problems\nStop Peeing, Right Now\nThe Potemkin Village\nPope Benedict The Backward\nGood Choices and Bad Choices\nSome Music for the Zeitgeist\nIraq Is Not Really A Dangerous Place"

Markets Don't Seem to Care\n\nThe global economy is once again showing signs of slowing yet global stock markets are back near their highs for the year on growing expectations the European Central Bank (ECB) will soon join other major central banks with a more expansionary monetary policy.\n\n\"Markets are dominated by central bank policies, low supply and strong demand and liquidity. It's about technical and not weak fundamentals. Everyone has watched Japan and in a zero inflation environment expects ECB to do same. It will be the biggest move we've seen in ages.\"\n\nExpectations are growing that the ECB will cut rates at its next meeting on May 2. But asset manager Coutts went a step further on Wednesday, suggesting the ECB should go several steps further and roll out its unlimited bond buying program, which it announced last year.\n\n\"The ECB needs to take the theoretically unlimited commitment of its entire balance sheet, through its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program, a step further by actively participating in credit markets to facilitate their functioning,\" to Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for Europe at Coutts said.\n\nIn Europe, markets have also been buoyed by lower borrowing costs for many of the region's most troubled economies. Analysts have cited the massive increase in the Bank of Japan's quantitative easing program, which has driven yield-hungry investors to the bond markets of Spain and Italy. Plus, European policymakers have suggested in recent weeks that they will dial back their push for austerity and debt reduction and concentrate more on growth.\n\nStill, for investors focused on macroeconomic data, there's plenty to be worried about after a slew of weak data in recent days, including worse than expected readings from purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) from China and Germany and a fall in U.S. durable goods orders.\n\n\"Bad news is good news for equities,\" Nick Verdi and Moyeen Islam, analysts at Barclays said in a research note Wednesday.\n\n\"The relatively strong performance of [global] equities is in stark contrast to increasing signs that the global real economy has slowed.

In the first section of the report, the IRS explained that its actions were two-pronged: first, it was identifying the individuals in the IRS responsible for the mismanagement outlined in the TIGTA report (\"Inappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify Tax-Exempt Applications for Review,\" TIGTA Rep't No. 2013-10-053), and, second, it was reexamining the evidence in the TIGTA report to determine if there was more wrongdoing or inappropriate conduct beyond that which TIGTA identified. One of the actions taken in response to the problems identified in the TIGTA report was removing five individuals from their leadership positions within the IRS. As for fixing the problems with the review of tax-exemption applications, the IRS has:\nSuspended the use of be on the lookout (BOLO) lists that were used to identify organizations with names like \"tea party\"; Overhauled the business processes for reviewing tax-exempt status; Started to develop new guidance to enable IRS staff to operate without BOLO lists; Added technical and programmatic experts to assist with reviewing applications for tax-exempt status; Initiated a new process whereby certain taxpayers whose applications for Sec. 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status had been identified for potentially inappropriate campaign intervention and have been in the IRS's backlog for more than 120 days have the option of obtaining an approval if they self-certify that they will meet certain guidelines; Created a new \"Advocacy Application Review Committee\" to provide expertise from other IRS divisions to review screening and determination decisions; Began creating a new check-and-balance mechanism to review IRS criteria and screening procedures systematically - any material risks of the use of inappropriate criteria found will be reported to the IRS commissioner, the IRS Oversight Board, and the relevant congressional tax committees; Engaged with the Treasury Department on the need for greater clarity for certain terms that are relevant for Sec. 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organizations, and recommended the guidance request be included in the next Treasury Priority Guidance Plan. The report also noted that, although the confusion about the requirements to be a Sec. 501(c)(4) organization did not in itself cause the inappropriate targeting, it did play a role in some of the lengthy delays in issuing tax-exempt status determinations. It also reviewed the nine recommendations in the TIGTA report and detailed its progress in responding to each one. The final section of the report reiterated the IRS's commitment to fixing the problems identified in the TIGTA report and explained that similar problems may exist in other IRS areas. To that end, the report stated that it would conduct a thorough review and vetting of the organizational failures that resulted in the problems identified in the TIGTA report, assess whether similar issues exist in other IRS business units, and then issue a series of reforms to address each finding.\nWerfel, whose formal IRS title is now principal deputy commissioner, was appointed acting head of the Service on May 16, following the resignation of acting commissioner Steven Miller, who stepped down in the wake of the TIGTA report."

Political Risk Moderates\nAon's 2013 risk map shows an increase in countries where political risk is lower, but problems may be lurking in supply chains.\nBy Susan Kelly April 8, 2013 \u2022 Reprints\nGlobal political risk has moderated as emerging economies stabilize in the wake of the Arab Spring and pressures related to the financial crisis abate, according to Aon Risk Solutions' latest mapping of such risk.\nOn Aon's political risk map for 2013, 13 countries were upgraded to show they pose less political risk, while 12 were downgraded to show they pose a higher risk. While that nearly even split between upgrades and downgrades may not sound encouraging, it represents a big improvement over 2012, when just three countries were upgraded and 21 were downgraded, and 2011, when 11 upgrades were outpaced by 19 downgrades.\n\"The overall situation has been improving,\" said Roger Schwartz, senior vice president of political risk for Aon Risk Solutions, noting that the ripple effects of the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011 have been subsiding. \"The political violence has eased in some areas, and the economics have eased in some areas but not in others.\"\nThe upgrades of a few countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus region, including Azerbaijan and Armenia, and cited efforts in emerging Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States to put in place structural reforms, according to Aon. In the Middle East, where a number of nations were downgraded in 2012, Bahrain, Oman and UAE were upgraded this year. Countries in Northern and Western Africa remain under pressure, with Algeria, Cameron, Chad and Mali downgraded on this year's map.\nAon Risk Solutions' map focuses on the developing world and excludes members of the eurozone and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This year's map was developed in partnership with Roubini Global Economics and includes input from Lloyd's syndicates and insurers that write political risk insurance.\nThe political risk map assesses six areas of risk for each country: exchange transfer, legal and regulatory, political interference, political interference, political violence, sovereign nonpayment and supply chain disruption.\nThis year's generally upbeat message was qualified by a big uptick in the number of countries tagged with supply chain risk, with that characterization added to 47 countries and territories, while just eight countries showed an improvement in supply chain risk, including Brazil, China, India and Panama.\nSchwartz noted that many of the countries that had the supply chain risk icon added this year are in Africa and the Middle East, regions that are politically stressed. \"A lot of these supply chain issues are relating to the ability to get product in or out of the country,\" he said.\nA recent Deloitte survey suggests that supply chain risks are increasing in developed economies as well. The survey of 600 executives at retail and manufacturing companies worldwide showed 48% are seeing risk events crop up in their supply chain more frequently over the past three years, and 53% said supply chain risk events are more costly than they were three years ago.\nKelly Marchese, a principal in the supply chain strategy practice at Deloitte Consulting, linked the increase in supply chain problems to the fact that companies' supply chains have become more complex and more likely to span the globe. \"This problem isn't going to go away, it's only going to get tougher to manage a supply chain. As complicated as our supply chains have gotten, we have to get more sophisticated about how we manage the risk,\" Marchese said.\nThe mention of supply"

        "webpage": "Fed Focus Fed: Low rates until unemployment below 6.5% By Annalyn Kurtz @AnnalynKurtz Bernanke and fiscal cliff in 90 seconds Some call it QE Infinity. The Federal Reserve announced plans Wednesday to expand its controversial and open-ended stimulus program known as quantitative easing, and keep short-term interest rates near zero. And the central bank dropped more hints as to when those easing programs might end, linking both to the strength of the job market. One economist called it an \"historic move,\" signaling the Fed is putting more weight on the unemployment rate than ever before. \"This is as aggressive as Fed easing has ever been,\" said Sherry Cooper, chief economist for BMO Financial Group. The Fed will buy $45 billion in Treasuries, in addition to its existing policy of buying $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month. Those new Treasury purchases go above and beyond Operation Twist, a policy set to end this month that swapped short-term Treasuries the Fed already owned for longer term bonds. The hope is the additional purchases will continue to push long-term interest rates even lower. Mortgage rates have already fallen to record lows, in step with the Fed's stimulus program, and a housing recovery seems to be building steam. The end date for all this easing? Bond buying will continue until the job market improves \"substantially,\" and rates will remain at historic lows until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5%, or inflation exceeds 2.5% a year. Wednesday was the first time the Fed has issued an exact target for the unemployment rate, and it marked the end of the Fed's calendar guidance, which previously stated it planned to keep interest rates low until at least 2015. The unemployment rate recently fell to 7.7% in November, but the decline was largely because 350,000 people stopped looking for work that month. \"Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated,\" the Federal Reserve said in a statement Wednesday. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has also repeatedly expressed concerns about what might happen to the economy if Congress and the White House are unable to agree on a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of tax hikes and automatic spending cuts by the end of the year. For these reasons, the Fed reiterated Wednesday that it expects to keep its key interest rate, the federal funds rate, near zero until there is more significant improvement in the job market. The federal funds rate is the rate banks pay to lend money to each other overnight, and it influences other key interest rates on mortgages, credit cards and business loans. Related: Federal Reserve official aims for 6.5% unemployment The Fed has kept this rate near zero for four years, but that alone has not stimulated the economy enough to lead to a full jobs recovery. To add additional stimulus, the Fed has also been purchasing various types of bonds. The Fed's policy is not without risks though. Some economists fear the Fed will find it difficult to shed these assets should the economy eventually heat up. Because these purchases also add to the money supply, critics (including some Fed officials) also worry this policy could eventually fuel inflation and weaken the value of the U.S. dollar. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, one of the Fed's voting members, opposed buying more bonds Wednesday, as he has all year. He has said in the past that he fears the purchases will have little impact on the economy, other than to fuel inflation. Greenspan: Government cuts key to debt fix For now, rapid inflation seems a long way off though. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, calculated by the Commerce Department, has not exceeded 2% a year (the Fed's long-run target) for four consecutive years. And with wages barely rising, inflation is unlikely to accelerate any time soon. The Fed also issued new economic forecasts Wednesday. The central bank lowered its growth projections for 2013 slightly but also indicated that the unemployment rate may fall further than it had thought just a few months ago.

Former secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Chongqing branch Bo Xilai (\u8584\u7199\u4f86), the son of one of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong's (\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771) comrades and a supposed \"immortal\" of the revolution, was recently sentenced to life in prison after his conviction on charges of corruption and abuse of power.Outside China, princelings are feeling the heat as well. Not long ago, the US Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it was investigating JPMorgan Chase's hiring of princelings in Hong Kong, who apparently delivered lucrative underwriting deals for the bank.While recent scandals have put China's princelings under a harsh media spotlight, they have been hot commodities for Western companies seeking to capitalize on their guangxi  -  connections  -  in order to secure multibillion dollar transactions. The list of financial institutions that have engaged in such hiring practices reads like a who's who of investment banking.It is premature to conclude that JPMorgan violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by employing children of Chinese officials who oversaw companies that retained the bank to underwrite their stock offerings. Nonetheless, the case highlights a broader trend: The wooing of China's princelings by prestigious Western educational institutions and businesses for the purpose of advancing their parochial interests in the burgeoning Chinese market.The unseemly race to recruit princelings starts at the world's leading colleges and universities. Because China has no universities that rival the Ivy League or Oxford and Cambridge, senior Chinese officials prefer to send their children to these schools.\nGiven the opacity surrounding admission to these highly selective institutions, it is impossible to tell whether princelings get in on merit or because of their family background. It is notable that princelings are not found in the most prestigious doctoral programs, where professors, not administrators, make admission decisions. Likewise, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology, have a dearth of princelings.Indeed, the sheer number of princelings, including children of incumbent Chinese leaders, now attending Ivy League universities clearly points to the importance of family ties. Chinese President Xi Jinping's (\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73) daughter, for example, studies at Harvard under an assumed name, and Bo's son has been a student at Oxford and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government; he is studying at Columbia Law School.Elite Western colleges and universities, having identified China as a top market for fund-raising and high-end network building, regard the princelings as a valuable investment. Nurturing ties with China's political elite is good business, and they can help open doors.However, preferential treatment for princelings at elite universities (and business schools) has real social costs. A place awarded to a less-qualified student is a place denied to a qualified applicant.Worse still, this injustice is self-perpetuating. Western investment banks and multinationals can use elite academic credentials to justify a job offer, even if the real reason is the hope that putting a princeling on the payroll will give the company a rainmaker in China."

        "webpage": "What Is an Income Replacement?\nWith retirement, income replacement involves the activation of other sources of income to maintain the standard of living. Watch the Did-You-Know slideshow\nIncome replacement is the process of replacing lost income, due to factors such as extended illness, a permanent injury, or even retirement. The goal of income replacement is to substitute some other source of income for at least a portion of the lost income, usually enough to allow the individual to continue enjoying a standard of living that is similar to what he or she has enjoyed previously. Depending on the lifestyle of the individual, this usually means seeking income replacement that amounts to anywhere between sixty and ninety percent of the previous income. In situations where employees are unable to continue working due to illness or injury, there are two different approaches that may be implemented in order to manage income replacement. One approach has to do with provisions found within the employment contract. It is not unusual for employers to include a clause that guarantees the employee will continue to receive his or her usual salary for a limited period of time after being declared disabled by a qualified medical professional. Often, this clause allows the employee to enjoy a continued monthly income long enough to qualify for other forms of support, such as a government sponsored disability program. Ad\nA second approach to income replacement has to do with maintaining insurance that guarantees some type of monthly income in the event of illness or permanent disability. While the names for this type of coverage vary somewhat around the world, many insurance providers who offer this type of coverage will refer to it as income replacement benefits. Generally, this type of coverage will not equal the monthly salary or wages normally generated by the insured party, but will provide a fixed monthly benefit. With this approach, it is up to the consumer to determine how much income is needed to maintain a decent standard of living, and structure the insurance coverage accordingly. With retirement, income replacement involves the activation of other sources of income to maintain the standard of living. The retirement income often is composed of processed from a pension fund that was established through the employer, and any government supported program that the employee paid into each pay period over the years. Depending on the tax laws that apply, the retiree may owe taxes if his combined income replacement exceeds a certain amount annually. While there are situations where employers may offer income replacement outside of the employee contract, such as in a verbal agreement, this type of arrangement can be somewhat risky. Should the officer who provided that verbal assurance die or choose to leave the company, proving that the agreement was ever made may be extremely difficult. For this reason, including the replacement assurance within a written document is highly recommended.

The Netherlands and Germany have moved ahead of the U.S. on the top 10 leaderboard.The report found that some aspects of the U.S.'s political environment continue to raise concern among business leaders, \"particularly the low public trust in politicians and a perceived lack of government efficiency.\"The Forum  -  which also hosts an annual gathering of global business and political leaders in the Swiss ski resort of Davos every January  -  ranks a country's competitiveness according to factors such as the state of its infrastructure and its ability to foster innovation.The survey comes just a day before President Barack Obama addresses the Democratic National Convention in his bid to defeat Republican candidate Mitt Romney in November's election.A little over a year ago, the United States lost its triple A credit rating from Standard & Poor's after a stand-off between Republicans and Democrats over the raising of the debt ceiling stoked fears of a potential debt default.\"We urge governments to act decisively by adopting long-term measures to enhance competitiveness and return the world to a sustainable growth path,\" said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum.Switzerland tops the overall rankings of 144 economies in the Global Competitiveness Report 2012-13 for the fourth consecutive year, followed by Singapore. The Forum said Switzerland's standing rests notably on its innovation and labor market efficiency, as well as the sophistication of its business sector.Including Switzerland, six northern European countries make up the top 10. Others on the leaderboard include Hong Kong and Japan, while central African country Burundi brings up the rear.Though northern European countries have consolidated their positions since the financial crisis of 2008, the survey found that those in southern Europe, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy, continue to suffer from a host of economic problems, including poor access to financing and rigid labor markets. Greece is faring worst of Europe's problem economies and is ranked at 96th.\"Persistent divides in competitiveness across regions and within regions, particularly in Europe, are at the origin of the turbulence we are experimenting today, and this is jeopardizing our future prosperity,\" said Schwab.Elsewhere, the Forum found that leading emerging economies are displaying different performances. China, at 29th place, has risen in the rankings and leads the group, while Brazil has moved up to 48th. However, others such as South Africa, India and Russia have fallen."

He lost his case at the U.S. Supreme Court. Alex Wong\nOriginally published on February 16, 2012 8:53 am For older Americans looking for work, finding a job can be a tremendous challenge. Someone 55 or older will typically take three months longer to find employment than the average job seeker. And with more people of all ages looking for work in the slow economy, age discrimination complaints are on the rise  -  but becoming harder to win. Employment law experts say that has a lot to do with one particular case: Gross v. FBL Financial Services Inc. 'Persona Non Grata' One day in 2003, Jack Gross saw a memo detailing staffing changes at the insurance company where he worked. \"I got this ahead of time, and it just jumped off the page,\" he recalls. \"Everybody that they're naming here is my age or older. Nobody under 50 was getting demoted. The only promotions were people who were basically a generation younger than us.\" Gross, 54 and a vice president at FBL Financial at the time, was among a dozen employees demoted that day. All were older workers, and all were high performers. But Gross alone decided to sue his employer for age discrimination. \"That was terrible. Once you file suit against your company, you're pretty much persona non grata,\" he says. \"I felt like I was crossing enemy lines.\" Former friends at work spurned Gross. He was excluded from meetings and received virtually no emails or phone calls. The ostracism made him sick with stress, but he stayed on the job another nine years because he felt he had no choice. What employer in his native Des Moines, he thought, would hire someone older who had also filed an age discrimination suit? Gross eventually won in lower court, but the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court  -  where Gross lost. In a 5-4 decision, the high court ruled that a plaintiff must prove, with a preponderance of evidence, that age was the reason for discrimination. In effect, Gross v. FBL increased the burden of proof for age discrimination suits. Because of the ruling, experts say hundreds of other cases have been thrown out. \"Personally, that's one of the things that I resent most,\" Gross says. \"That my name is being associated with so much injustice and unfairness.\" Complaints On The Rise Even before the ruling, it was costly and difficult to bring such cases. Gross says it cost $11,000 just to print the documents related to his case. And Gross' suit coincides with a time when the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says age discrimination is becoming a bigger problem. Stuart Ishimaru, an EEOC commissioner, says age-related charges make up a growing number of complaints filed at the commission. And, he says, \"I think that the number of formal complaints that come in to us understate the nature of the problem.\" Ishimaru says that's because dismissal or demotion cases like Gross' are hard enough to prove. It's even more challenging, he says, to figure out how to prosecute age discrimination in hiring. Of all the issues the EEOC deals with, Ishimaru says, hiring has been \"a real conundrum for us. And frankly in this economy, where people are looking for jobs, they don't have time to worry about a discrimination suit. They're not going to be thinking about this.\" Gerald Maatman, a Chicago attorney who represents employers in age discrimination cases, says such suits are high stakes for companies because the monetary damages involved are typically higher than other claims. But, Maatman admits, plaintiffs have a difficult time bringing hiring cases. \"Those claims are very, very difficult to prove, in that the smoking gun evidence that needs to exist to prove a successful claim is very difficult to find in those circumstances,\" he says. 'A Chilling Effect' Gross' case has had a chilling effect, according to Dan Kohrman, a senior attorney at the AARP Foundation, which helps bring age discrimination cases. \"These kinds of decisions scare off workers and scare off lawyers,\" Kohrman says. \"Because the clear trend is, it's harder to prove an age case. You may not get a fair shake in all kinds of interpretations of the law.\" Kohrman says these days, plaintiffs are seeing better luck in state courts than at the federal level. States like California, Michigan and New York all have relatively strong protections for older workers. But, Kohrman adds, \"If you don't live in that kind of state, then it is tough. It is really tough.\" As for Gross, he says his best hope is that his case will prompt Congress to pass tougher laws against age discrimination.Copyright 2013 NPR. To see more, visit .

        "webpage": "New sanctions against Russia are limited but complex\nMany U.S.-based companies that do business with Russia may be happy that recent sanctions in response to the nation's activities in Ukraine do not include the entire Russian economy.\nBy Ed SilversteinJuly 31, 2014\nBut that also makes matters more complex for general counsel and others who need to comply with the new regulations.\nThe recently imposed targeted sanctions by the United States and the European Union against Russia can be more difficult to comply with than prior country-wide sanctions, such as against Iran.\nBNP faces record-breaking fine and punishment in U.S. for breaking sanctions\nBNP Paribas pleads guilty to additional charge; judge satisfied with $9 billion penalty\nDid Miley Cyrus and Justin Timberlake run afoul of U.S. sanctions on Russia?\nThese recent sanctions are limited to certain individuals or companies in Russia, as opposed to the economy as a whole.\n\"It's easier to comply with a country-wide embargo,\" confirmed William M. McGlone, co-head of Latham & Watkins' Export Controls, Economic Sanctions & Customs Practice, in an interview with InsideCounsel.\nThe former chair of the Committee on Export Controls and Economic Sanctions of the American Bar Association's Section of International Law and Practice, McGlone points out that the majority of business activity involving U.S. firms in Russia remains \"permissible.\" But the EU and U.S. sanctions \"target certain sectors of the Russian economy,\" he adds. The sectors that are now most at risk for being impacted by the sanctions are defense, energy, finance and banking.\nIf U.S. businesses think they may need to comply with these sanctions against Russia, McGlone says many companies opt to \"err on the conservative side.\" In fact, many firms will operate as if all businesses worldwide are covered. He warns that currently there is a \"very aggressive enforcement climate\" by U.S. officials.\nIf businesses need clarification, U.S. government agencies have released frequently asked question documents, as well as other guidance. But do not expect too much if you choose to contact a government agency for interpretive guidance. McGlone said it \"is not always immediate\" nor is it always \"helpful.\" It makes sense, given the risk, to rely on specialized counsel with expertise in the field, he added.\nMcGlone points out as well that U.S. companies are required to immediately comply with sanctions, and need to screen business activities in Russia and check lists to ensure they are in compliance. There is no grandfathering option or phase-in provision on these sanctions.\n\"U.S. persons, U.S. firms are immediately expected to follow these rules as soon as they are published,\" McGlone said.\nInitially, the U.S. sanctions were more aggressive that the ones from the EU. Then it changed this week, with the EU sanctions now similar to those found in the United States.\nTo get an idea how the sanctions work, on July 29 the U.S. Department of the Treasury added three Russian banks  -  Bank of Moscow, Russian Agricultural Bank and VTB Bank OAO  -  to the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List (SSI) that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) first announced on July 16, according to an advisory note to clients published by Latham & Watkins.\n\"These 'sectoral' sanctions prohibit US persons from transacting in, providing financing for, or dealing in new debt of longer than 90 days maturity or new equity for these financial institutions,\" the statement explains. \"These restrictions also apply to entities that are owned 50 percent or more by entities on the SSI List.\"\nStill, there are some reported loopholes or gaps when it comes to the Russian sanctions. For instance, The Wall Street Journal reported how EU subsidiaries of the Russian banks are exempt from the sanctions. Also, the U.S. sanctions did not include OAO Sberbank, which is Russia's largest bank, The Journal reported.\nFor those companies which violate sanctions, be forewarned. Penalties are steep and the U.S. government recently penalized European banks for illegally financing entities. For instance, BNP Paribas will pat almost $9 billion after pleading guilty to two charges of dealing with the U.S.-sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran and Cuba, InsideCounsel reported.

        "webpage": "3 Years Later, There's Still Work Left To Be Done On Dodd-Frank By John Ydstie\nOriginally published on August 19, 2013 5:58 pm Transcript AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. Today, President Obama called all of the country's top financial regulators to the White House to get a progress report on implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. That's the set of reforms that were passed following the financial crisis. With the fifth anniversary of the financial meltdown nearing, the president wants to communicate a sense of urgency about following through on the reforms. NPR's John Ydstie joins us to talk about how much is completed and what's left to be done. And, John, the Dodd-Frank Act, the main piece of financial reform legislation was passed back in 2010. Three years later, where are we? JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Well, it's clearly been a slow process. The law itself was essentially an outline. And since 2010, regulators with a lot of input from the financial industry and consumer groups have been formulating the rules to carry it out. At present, only about 40 percent of the rules mandated by Dodd-Frank have been finished, and more than half the regulatory deadlines in the law have been missed. On the other hand, regulators have gained some momentum in the past six months. The president undoubtedly wants to keep the momentum going since the anniversary of the failure of Lehman Brothers, which triggered the most intense part of the financial crisis, is just a month away. And the president wants to be able to say we're safer now. CORNISH: At the time, the big question is whether this law would end the idea of an institution being too big to fail. And are there still financial institutions that the government would have to bail out if they got into trouble, as they did with AIG and others back in 2008? YDSTIE: Well, that is the big question. And, you know, Audie, actually, Dodd-Frank does specifically outlaw government rescue. So legally, government officials are barred from what they did in those cases of AIG and Bear Stearns and some other institutions. But only a month ago, Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury secretary Jack Lew both essentially said there are U.S. banks that remain too big to fail. And Lew said if we get to the end of this year and can't with a straight face say we've ended too-big-to-fail, we're going to have to look at other options. CORNISH: Well, what do you think? Will the Treasury secretary be able to keep a straight face at the end of the year? YDSTIE: Well, we'll see. There are a lot of components to this, and some parts are in better shape than others. One big step forward in the past couple of months was the finalizing of new capital rules. They require banks to have more of their own money set aside to offset potential losses if they get in trouble. Another very important piece of ending too-big-to-fail is to make sure the FDIC has systems in place to go into one of these huge financial institutions and quickly wind it down without damaging the financial system, you know, the way the FDIC does now with big commercial banks. That is a work in progress. The FDIC has done some dry runs. But no one's going to really know whether they're ready until a big financial institution fails. CORNISH: And when supporters were promoting this law, they talked a lot about consumer protections. What's the status of that? YDSTIE: That's one area that's pretty well advanced. The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in business and has developed a number of rules like the qualified-mortgage rule. That requires lenders and makes sure consumers get mortgages they can reasonably be expected to pay. Also, Congress finally confirmed the bureau's director, Richard Cordray, so it's got some leadership in place now. CORNISH: Now, one of the markets that people think contributed to the financial crisis was derivatives. Those were those complicated financial products that most of us don't understand, including, as it turned out, a lot of people on Wall Street. YDSTIE: Oh, exactly. CORNISH: Any progress there? YDSTIE: Well, this is another area where there's been a lot of progress in the past few months. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has issued rules to regulate the trading of derivatives, putting them on exchanges and requiring more capital in that system as well. But another important regulation, the Volcker rule, which would keep the big banks from investing for their own benefit, is way behind schedule. So there's still lots of work to be done. CORNISH: John, thank you for the update. YDSTIE: You're welcome, Audie. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.Related Program: All Things ConsideredView the discussion thread. \u00a9 2016 KASU"

        "webpage": "Investing in Commodity Futures\n\"The economic rationale for these returns is the reward that investors in commodity futures receive for providing price insurance to commodity producers.\"\nImagine an asset class whose returns are the same as those on the stock market but less volatile, and which are negatively correlated with stock-and-bond returns and positively correlated with inflation. That asset class is an investment in commodity futures. And, despite being a very old asset class, commodity futures are not widely appreciated.\nIn Facts and Fantasies About Commodity Futures (NBER Working Paper No. 10595), co-authors Gary Gorton and Geert Rouwenhorst show that over a 45-year period a diversified investment in collateralized commodity futures has earned historical returns that are comparable to stocks. That reward, rather than foreseeable trends in commodity prices, is the key to the returns that a futures investor can expect. Individual commodities can be very volatile, but much of this volatility can be avoided by investing in a diversified index of commodities.\nFutures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a commodity at a future date, at a price that is agreed upon today. Except for collateral requirements, futures contracts do not require a cash outlay for either buyers or sellers. On average, the buyer of a futures contract is compensated by the seller of futures if the futures price is set below the expected spot price at the time of the expiration of the futures contract. The opposite is true when the futures price is set above the expected future spot price. In 1930, John Maynard Keynes postulated that sellers of futures (hedgers) would compensate the buyers of futures (speculators), a situation he referred to as \"normal backwardation.\" By examining the returns to futures over long periods, Gorton and Rouwenhorst indirectly test this Keynesian prediction.\nThey construct a dataset of returns on individual commodity futures going back as far as 1959. The dataset combines information about individual commodity futures prices obtained from the Commodity Research Bureau (covering, among other exchanges, the CBOT and CME) and the London Metals Exchange. Investment returns are computed by \"rolling\" positions in individual futures contracts forward over time. Commodities are combined into an equally weighted index; much of the paper is concerned with the behavior of this index. Historically, the average return on the equally weighted index of commodity futures has exceeded the return on T-Bills by about 5 percent per annum. This is about the same as the historical risk premium on stocks (the equity premium) over the 1959-2004 period, but the commodity index has slightly lower standard deviation than the S&P 500. The relatively low volatility of the commodity index stems from the fact that the pair-wise correlations between individual commodities are relatively low. Commodities are also less risky by other standards. First, the distribution of commodity returns is skewed right, whereas equity return distributions are skewed left. In other words, relative to a normal \"bell-shape\" curve, equities experience proportionally more crashes, whereas the \"crashes\" in commodities occur most often on the upside, leading to positive returns to investors. Further, Gorton and Rouwenhorst show that commodities have the ability to diversify portfolios of stocks and bonds. The sources of the diversification benefits are the ability of commodities to provide a () hedge against inflation - stocks and bonds are poor hedges by comparison - and to ly offset the cyclical variation in the returns of stocks and bonds. -- partial"

        "webpage": "Ryan Encourages Families To File For Earned Income Tax Credit CHICAGO - Governor George H. Ryan is encouraging moderate and lower-income working families to take advantage of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) that can result in cash refunds to those who qualify. \"Every working family in Illinois needs to find out if they are eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit,\" Ryan said. \"We need to work to get the word out to these families, because it seems that the biggest problem is that many people have never heard of the EITC.\" In 1999, more than 740,000 Illinois families received a federal EITC, bringing $1.2 billion to the state from the federal treasury. Estimates indicate that 150,000 additional families in Illinois may qualify for the EITC. Total funds available to Illinois residents could exceed $250 million in tax credits. These funds are retroactive for three years. In order to qualify for the credit, families need to file federal tax forms, even if they do not owe taxes.\nSingle or married people earning no more than $30,580 with more than one qualifying child will receive a $3,816 tax credit. Those earning no more than $26,928 with one qualifying child will receive a $2,312 tax credit. Single or married filers earning no more than $10,200 without qualifying children will receive a $347 tax credit. If the EITC exceeds the amount of taxes owed, then the taxpayer will receive a cash refund. Last year, the average EITC was more than $1,500.\nRyan said electronic filing is the most efficient processing method, and revisions to the process provide four options for taxpayers: internet filing, touch-tone telephone filing, electronic filing, and filing with the use of retail software. Taxes can also be billed to a credit card and refunds may be directly deposited in an account. The Tax Counseling Project is again offering low-income taxpayers free preparation and advice. \"More people have moved from welfare to work and that has increased the number of taxpayers. Some of these people are filing their taxes for the first time,\" said David Marzahl, Executive Director of the Center for Law and Human Services, which operates the Tax Counseling Project. \"We want to insure that people who qualify for the EITC can access this valuable tax credit.\" For further information about the Tax Counseling Project and their 21 operating sites across the state call (888) 827-8511. ###"

        "webpage": "Being 'Rich' Is More Common Than You Think, At Least Temporarily By Sean Braswell\nJun 28, 2014 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email By the time they turn 60 years old, 21 percent of U.S. adults have enjoyed an annual household income of above $250,000 for at least one year of their working lives.\nWe tend to think of income groups such as the \"top 1 percent\" as being relatively stable collectives, particularly in nations like the U.S. that, despite popular rhetoric, enjoy rather low levels of social mobility. But the truth is more complicated, and more volatile. The average American's chances of attaining the American dream, at least in terms of a high income, are greater than you might think, but so are the odds of waking up from that dream. By the time they turn 60 years old, 21 percent of U.S. adults have enjoyed an annual household income of above $250,000 for at least one year of their working lives, according to an analysis reported in the new book Chasing the American Dream. And the number of people who temporarily join the ranks of what amounts to the top 2 percent of earners has more than doubled since 1979. The authors of the study, Mark Robert Rank, Thomas A. Hirschl and Kirk A. Foster, used longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a representative sample of U.S. families and individuals dating back to 1968, to examine social mobility trends in America. The researchers argue that \"even when looking at shorter periods of time, affluence is a relatively common event\" in America, but one that is also typically short-lived given the \"sizable amount of turnover and movement within the top levels of the income distribution.\" The phenomenon also extends further down the income spectrum to a group that marketers and money managers refer to as the \"mass affluent\"  -  the roughly 25 million households with an annual income of at least $75,000 who are responsible for about 40 percent of U.S. consumer spending. Incredibly, more than three-quarters (77 percent) of working Americans, primarily older professionals, educated singles and working married couples, have for at least one year enjoyed an annual household income greater than $100,000. For many, however, the experience is fleeting. Even if more than one-fifth of working Americans will ascend to the top 2 percent for at least a year, only 4.6 percent will do so for five or more years. The short-lived affluence of the impermanent rich is often driven by a specific event  -  a new job or promotion, a yearly bonus, a spouse entering the labor market  -  that is either temporary by nature or subsequently undermined by a job loss, medical problem or family break-up. Still, those who briefly enter America's top income brackets often settle into the tier of the mass-affluent over time and their somewhat illusory gains appear to have a very real impact on everything from their consumption patterns to their politics. \"For many in this group, the American dream is not dead,\" says Mark Rank, the lead researcher and a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. \"They have reached affluence for parts of their lives and see it as very attainable, even if the dream has become more elusive for everyone else.\" According to a recent analysis by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, this group of \"new rich\" Americans tend to rely on income and not wealth to preserve their social status and tend to be more socially liberal but fiscally conservative than lower income groups. They're generally in favor of gay marriage and abortion, for example, but largely opposed to programs like food stamps that target the disadvantaged and to government attempts to combat inequality. Can either major U.S. political party tap into this emerging group of fiscally conservative social liberals? If the group's view on opportunity in America is any indication, then the GOP may have the inside track. The AP also cites a Gallup poll from last October finding that 60 percent of those Americans who bring home more than $90,000 per year feel that the average American has \"plenty of opportunity\" to succeed  -  a sentiment shared by 67 percent of Republicans, but only 38 percent of Democrats. Of course there's much more to the American dream than a six-figure income, but it certainly doesn't hurt when it comes to the rising cost of everything from health care to food to a college education. And even if you agree with the late comedian George Carlin that \"it's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it,\" it's clear that for the growing number of temporarily affluent among us, the American dream has evolved into a very convincing power nap.Copyright 2014 Ozy.com.

Hence, the concise conceptualization: Crisis and Leviathan (the main title of my 1987 book on the growth of government in the United States from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth century).\nIn the past century, the first five such critical episodes in the United States were: World War I; the Great Depression; World War II; a multi-faceted set of crises associated with the civil-rights revolution and the Vietnam War, roughly coincident with the presidencies of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon; and the post 9/11 events associated with the so-called War on Terror and the U.S. attacks on and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. We are now amid another such critical episode, which springs from the housing bust that began in 2006, the economic recession that began late in 2007, and the financial debacle that reached its climax in September 2008.\nThe current troubles are complex and raise a multitude of questions. Many books and articles no doubt will be written to analyze these various issues in scholarly depth and detail, and certainly anything we might say today must be regarded as preliminary, at best. I focus here on a few aspects of the present episode that relate closely to my own research on the growth of government, a field of study to which I have returned again and again over the past thirty years.\nThe current recession has elicited many comparisons with earlier business downturns, especially with the Great Depression. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is often described as an expert on the Great Depression who takes its lessons, as he understands them, deeply into account as he formulates and implements Fed policies. Likewise, many other economists have revisited the Great Depression recently in search of lessons applicable to current policy-making. In all of these reflections, the mainstream economics profession in general has distinguished itself by an astonishing superficiality of historical knowledge and lack of theoretical prowess.\nThe swiftness with which a great many mainstream economists have reverted to the simplistic \"vulgar Keynesianism\" that had its heyday from the late 1940s to the late 1960s has been nothing short of shocking, given that by the end of the 1970s such old-fashioned Keynesianism seemed to have been completely discredited and superseded in the leading echelons of the mainstream economics profession. Now it has come roaring back. Of course, the general public, whose understanding of such matters is always primitive, and the politicians, who are always looking for plausible intellectual rationales to excuse their insatiable spending, borrowing, and power-grabbing, had never abandoned vulgar Keynesianism, so they were elated to find that the economic \"experts\" were again confirming their own self-interested inclinations.\nFrom such vulgar Keynesian thinking flowed the succession of \"stimulus\" spending measures, beginning with the Bush administration's, carried out in the spring of 2008. Other governments have gone down the same foolish path. Of course, as any competent economist could have testified even fifty years ago, such temporary government-spending surges give people money that, for the most part, they save or use to pay off debts, rather than spending it along the lines envisioned by Keynesian \"multiplier\" analysis to set in motion an upward spiral of income, expenditure, real output, and employment. Much of the so-called stimulus spending in the United States has served only to bulk up the pay and benefits of government employees (federal, state, and local), effectively transferring income from the private sector to the government sector, and to reward other groups, such as the United Auto Workers and low-income home buyers, for their support of the Obama administration - past, present, or future.\nAt the same time, Bernanke and other central bankers, obsessed by an irrational fear of deflation, set in motion liquidity-enhancing measures so vast that no one could reasonably have anticipated them. Excess reserves of depository institutions in the United States now substantially exceed $1 trillion, as the banks have simply absorbed the effusions of dollars the Fed has spent to acquire an unprecedented variety of \"securities,\" including various \"toxic\" assets that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other ill-managed firms had acquired during the housing boom and later.\non Thursday, May 20th, 2010 at 8:13 am and is filed under Government Evil."

Try refreshing the page, clicking/tapping on this story in the menu on the left to reload it, or if you are using a desktop computer, altering the width of your browser window. We apologize for the bug.)\nHow do you measure the commitment of the world's wealthiest countries to global development? We've got answers: The Center for Global Development has created an index that ranks the world's top economies across seven categories - aid, trade, investment, migration, environment, security and technology - to see how if they are giving others a hand up. We've got the take-aways here, and you can use our country comparison tool above to see how different nations match up.\nThe G-7 does not do well. The highest ranked country in the world's top economies is the United Kingdom, at #8; the United States is #18. The US scores only above average for promoting trade and gets dinged for arms exports, high C02 emissions, and weak foreign aid efforts that are often tied to purchases of US goods. The UK, at the top spot for the wealthiest countries, is above average in aid, trade, investment, environment and security.\nThe Scandinavians excel. What is it about northern Europe and well-intentioned internationalism? The top three are Denmark, Norway and Sweden, which donate large amounts of money relative to their size and target it at the most needy recipients, have migration-friendly policies, and support international security; their weaknesses are producing too much fossil fuel and, in Sweden's case, arms sales to poor and undemocratic governments.\nJapan and South Korea do not. The only Asian countries currently on the list (the study's authors are working on adapting its framework to the BRICs, however) don't fare all that well. \"They are quite different, more inward-oriented, at least in their government policy stance, and this shows up in a number of ways,\" David Roodman,who led the study, says. This is largely expressed in restrictive trade policies: Both countries scored negatively for protectionism; in particular, the countries' tariffs on rice are damaging to poorer Asian countries.\nThe European Union as a whole isn't that competitive. For the first time, the study's authors ranked Europe as though it were a nation - perhaps anticipating its recent Nobel Peace Prize win. It did OK, scoring just above average at 5.3; beating the United States and the Pacific nations but still coming in third behind Canada and New Zealand, which tops the list when Europe is aggregated.\nOne reason for that: peripheral European countries aren't cutting it. Four new countries were added to the list this year in Eastern Europe - Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland - and they all ended up at the bottom, just above Japan and South Korea.\nThe big lessons? There's more to development than giving aid. Trade remains one of the largest forces for development. Researchers are also getting a better understanding of newer measures of environmental security, and countries' efforts to share technological progress around the world, which could help lead to more development-friendly policies in the future. And openness to immigrants is another critical measure, since migration plays a big role in developing countries' growth. \"The policies we are focused on are not easily changed,\" Roodman says. \"We're not naive about the ability to make progress here. On the other hand, more generally, what the index shows is that there is a lot of potential for improvement.\""

The company recently issued a new report, \"A Conflict Inherent in the MakerTaker Model: Equities vs. Futures.\"\n\nAn earlier report looked at the conflict agency brokers face with passive limit orders. The new report looks at the conflict agency brokers face when deciding whether to cross the bid-ask spread.\n\n\"Brokers are in a very tough situation,\" said Mechner,. \"There is little they can do about this conflict other than urge clients to adopt the cost-plus model.\" In that model, which many hedge funds use, the broker charges a commission and if there is a fee or rebate at the end of the month, the broker will charge or rebate it to the client. Hedge funds and proprietary trading firms can use that, but institutional asset managers aren't set up to employ that model, he added. For them it becomes more complicated because of regulations on how prices are allocated to different investors.\n\nThe new report looks at quote imbalance as a predictor of short-term price movements.\n\n\"...a broker can use even rudimentary microstructure signals such as this to generate a significant performance improvement for his clients who pay a flat per-share fee, simply by crossing the spread when the quote imbalance is high enough.\" (See the charts on the blog site for more.)\n\nBut when it is the biggest benefit to the client for the broker to cross the spread is the exact moment when it is most expensive to the broker to be aggressive.\n\nThe problem is the market structure and the lack of action by regulators.\n\n\"It is not realistic to expect true cost blindness from brokers, given where commissions are compared to fees and rebates,\" Melcher added. \"We see it as a structural issue, an inherent conflict in the market structure.\"\n\nIt is useful for the buy-side to understand the issues, but brokers find it difficult to talk about, he said.\n\n\"There is very little transparency, very little discussion. We have said we think the maker taker model should be limited or ended. There's not much you can do from the fundamental level except to support regulatory change.\"\n\nBuy-side firms can use a broker neutral platform like FlexTrade or Portware or they can take more control of their own trading, he said. Developing their own models and algorithms for trading could be difficult, he added.\n\n\"It's a bit of a challenge because it requires a distinct skill set  -  quants who understand market structure and work with tick data and are also good programmers. Small shops that are tech savvy do it more often than the bigger institutional shops.\"\n\nPrgma contrasts the equities markets with futures traded on the CME which does not offer diffferntial fees or debates.\n\n\"The explicit cost of the aggressive and passive strategies are the same, and are independent of the quote imbalance. Thus, we observe that the same conflicts of interest found in the equity markets do not exist between clients trading futures and their brokers.\"\n\nMaker-taker models with their fees for brokers have proven they provide competitive value, but at the expense of clients. They present one of those conflicts for which Wall Street is famous, but no regulators have contacted Pragma on its research.\n\n\"When a client pays a flat per-share commission, this maker-taker market structure creates an intractable problem for brokers - being truly blind to fees and rebates would have a dramatic effect on profitability and would even render business at the lower end of current commission levels unprofitable,\" notes Pragma. \"Regulators should eliminate or limit rebates and similar payments for order flow. Such rebates obscure the true economics of the services brokers provide, create market distortions, and create unnecessary and inescapable misalignments of interest between broker and flat commission clients.\"\n\nPost Your Comment\n\nPost Your Reply\n\nForbes writers have the ability to call out member comments they find particularly interesting.

April 1, 2013\nMerrill Bulks Up Training How Merrill Lynch Wealth Management is reinventing advisor preparation.\nIn a bold bid to boost performance, Merrill Lynch Wealth Management has re-engineered its iconic training program - adding a national curriculum, compensated mentors and, even, \"breathing breaks.\"\nThe move is likely to be watched closely by industry insiders. As recruiter Rick Peterson, who heads Houston-based Rick Peterson & Associates, frames it: \"I'm not sure any training program has been judged to be good, not when historically only two out of 13 trainees make it in this industry after five years. Any new approach is better than anything that's been tried in the past. The fact of the matter is we desperately need new financial advisors.\"\nThe changes in Merrill's training program aren't tweaks but wholesale revisions that started in 2011 as part of the firm's ongoing mission to create what Dwight Mathis, chief of new advisor strategy, calls \"the Ivy League of financial advisor training.\"\nWhat is the difference between today's training program and the one Mathis himself graduated from in 1998? A lot. Traditionally, Merrill trainees have undergone a six-week development program at national headquarters followed by two years of salaried training at a branch elsewhere in the country. The result: a high degree of variability in success rates.\n\"When I first took this job, I looked around at all of our complexes to assess results. You quickly see that some complexes had graduation rates greater than 50% year in, year out while others were well below the national average,\" Mathis says. \"Variability is quality's enemy. We had 120 complexes with 120 different methods of delivering training.\"\nAs a result, Merrill two years ago hired an executive for each of its 11 geographic markets to head what it officially calls its Practice Management Development, or PMD, training program. There are also PMD coordinators in each of the 120 complexes whose job is to deliver the national program locally. Notably, the two-year training program has gone by the wayside. It is now 43 months long.\nIn the past, Merrill placed an emphasis on hiring people with sales experience. No longer. \"Often sales experience does not correlate to future sales success,\" observes Mathis. \"Often when they were looking for work, it was because they weren't very good at sales.\" Instead, the firm is reaching out to \"high achievers\" such as decorated military veterans, athletes, successful attorneys and accountants, and college students at the top of their class. And, for the first time, Merrill has made the certified financial planner designation a requirement of the curriculum. The firm has also identified three \"derailers\" it doesn't want: difficulty coping with rejection, a shaky work ethic and poor appetite for risk.\nWith new content still being added this year, it's too early to give the overhauled program a grade. But preliminary results are promising. Last year, an unprecedented 68% of advisor trainees hit their production goals, resulting in record high revenue.\n\"What we're trying to build is the most professional, client-focused sales and investment training program in the industry. If you're part of that program, it's going to be hard. We don't apologize for the standards,\" says Mathis.\n\"Still, we have a responsibility to these PMDers when we hire them to help them grow and graduate. One of the things that disturbs me in this industry is wh"

        "webpage": "Officials Search for Fannie-Freddie Road Map\nNick Timiraos And Deborah Solomon\nObama administration officials are struggling to reach consensus on a future path for mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, unable to agree on whether the government should provide a guarantee for new mortgages when the market stabilizes, according to people familiar with the discussions. The matter is becoming urgent because of a looming January deadline for the Treasury Department to produce recommendations to Congress for revamping the nation's system of housing finance. Top administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, have publicly discussed the merits of a limited but explicit government guarantee of securities backed by certain types of mortgages. Investors, academics and the housing industry say such a guarantee is needed to maintain a healthy market, particularly for long-term, fixed-rate loans that remain a keystone of U.S. housing. But the administration is divided over whether a backstop for new loans would be needed when markets return to normal, a process that could take several years. Some worry any guarantees expose the government to too much risk, as the $134 billion in losses incurred by Fannie and Freddie indicate. Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the federal agency that regulates Fannie and Freddie, echoed those concerns at a fall hearing. \"The negatives [of an explicit guarantee] have not been fully explored,\" he said, adding that taxpayers could be on the hook again if the government underpriced any guarantee. Also, in exchange for backstopping loans, the government \"would likely want a say\" in who should get loans and at what price, Mr. DeMarco said. Those in favor of a guarantee say it is needed to keep markets functioning during periods of stress. Others argue that because investors might assume the government will step in during a crisis, it's better to make guarantees explicit and then charge appropriately for them. The administration remains particularly sensitive about putting forward plans that might destabilize the mortgage market, which remains on government life support. It has committed unlimited aid to ensure the solvency of Fannie and Freddie, which guarantee half of the $10.6 trillion in U.S. home loans outstanding, and together with federal agencies enable more than nine in 10 new loans. Fannie and Freddie bundle mortgages into securities that are sold to investors, and they make investors whole when loans default. Investors long assumed that the government would rescue Fannie and Freddie if they ran into trouble. Democrats and Republicans have fought for years about the role of Fannie and Freddie in the housing market, and Republicans are likely to challenge any White House proposal that doesn't aim to wind down the companies quickly. The fragility of the housing market could complicate efforts to pursue major changes. Analysts expect any overhaul of the country's housing-finance system to take several years. At a minimum, the administration's proposal will likely focus on taking steps to attract private capital to return to the market, according to people familiar with the discussions. The government could do that by gradually allowing Fannie and Freddie to raise the guarantee fees they charge banks when they purchase loans. That would make private loans relatively more attractive, though it could also drive more business to the Federal Housing Administration. It would also be politically unpopular because it would raise borrowing costs. On Thursday, Fannie Mae said it would raise certain risk-based fees to lenders in April, following a similar announcement last month by Freddie Mac. In an October letter to Mr. DeMarco, a bipartisan group of 37 members of Congress expressed concern that higher loan fees being charged by Fannie and Freddie were \"prohibitively raising the cost of conventional mortgages.\" Officials could also push to reduce the maximum loan limits for mortgages Fannie and Freddie can purchase. Those limits were expanded as an emergency measure in 2008. A report published Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office noted that \"restoring lower loan limits could encourage\" the revival of the dormant private market for securitization. Some members of Congress from high-cost housing markets in California, New York and Massachusetts have objected to reducing loan limits. They say it would put pressure on home prices. Limits are set at $417,000 nationally but rise as high as $729,750 in high-cost areas. The housing industry and mortgage investors say an administration road map, even one they don't necessarily like, will create certainty that paves the way for private investors to return to the mortgage market. Fannie and Freddie executives say it will also make it easier to retain staff. \"If we don't have as much specificity, we have a greater challenge,\" said Charles E. Haldeman Jr., Freddie's chief executive, at a fall industry conference. Write to Nick Timiraos at  and Deborah Solomon at  Save Article"

        "webpage": "$85 Billion Versus $42 Billion: The New Sequester Argument By Alan Greenspan\nFeb 28, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Originally published on February 28, 2013 2:01 pm Just how much will the sequester cut? It depends on whom you ask. The White House has been saying spending will be reduced by $85 billion this year, unless the automatic spending cuts set to take effect Friday are averted. The Congressional Budget Office, however, just released a new report saying the cuts will only amount to $42 billion. Why do they differ so much? They don't, really. It's a technical difference, more than anything. The White House figure refers to how much money agencies have permission to spend (which is known as budget authority), while the CBO is looking at the amount they'd actually spend this year (outlays, in budget-speak). It's kind of like your credit card. Your limit says you can spend $1,000, but you end up only spending $500. The difference is that once Congress gives agencies budget authority, they will spend all the money eventually  -  maybe just not in the same year that they were given permission to do so. It may take more than a year to build a bridge, for example, even if all the money to pay for it was approved in the first year. As a result, not all of the $85 billion would have been spent this year, even if sequestration weren't to happen, CBO explains: \"Some would have been used to enter into contracts to buy goods or services to be provided and paid for next year or in subsequent years. Acquiring major weapons systems and completing large construction projects, for example, can take several years.\" The reduction in spending due to the sequester may not happen all at once, but it will result in smaller disbursements over time, says budget consultant Chuck Konigsberg, a former Democratic Senate aide. \"In programs where most of the funding is for personnel, most of the outlay reductions will occur in the current fiscal year,\" Konigsberg says. This may just be an argument only an accountant could love. Still, there is a difference between $42 billion and $85 billion. Choosing the larger budget authority number is an example of the White House trying to paint a dark picture of sequestration's effects, says Rich Meade, a former Republican staff director of the House Budget Committee. It's better to use the CBO numbers, he says, because then you're talking about the cash the government is actually spending  -  or not spending  -  in any given year. \"I've become increasingly frustrated by the way the White House has been portraying the effects of sequestration,\" Meade says. \"There will be notable changes in government, but it's not going to be cataclysmic, as they want to make you believe.\"Copyright 2013 NPR.

Weakening the finances of the country's banks, though, is the wrong way to go about it.\n\nGovernor Mark Carney has announced that, among other measures, the BoE will let banks operate with less equity than previously planned. The idea is to make banks more willing to lend, by relieving them of the concern that new loans would bring their equity levels below regulatory minimums.\n\nIn principle it makes sense to require banks to raise their capital ratios when the economy is strong, then let them decline a bit when it's weak -- what regulators call a countercyclical capital buffer. It's vital, though, that capital is built up sufficiently when conditions allow, so that when the rules are relaxed, banks have enough to weather any downturn. Right now, they don't. The BoE's efforts to increase requirements since the 2008 financial crisis have fallen short.\n\nBritish banks have been allowed to return a lot of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the total from 2009 through 2015 for the five largest U.K. banks was 63 billion pounds. That would have been enough to boost capital by more than 1 pound for every 100 pounds in assets. Today, they have a little over 6 pounds in equity per 100 pounds in assets -- far short of what's required to avoid distress in a severe crisis, as the banks' beaten-down stock prices suggest.\n\nBanks with more equity would be better equipped to support the economy through the difficult times that Brexit is likely to entail. Bear in mind, equity isn't money taken out of circulation: It's stable funding that banks can use to make loans. A recent paper from the Bank for International Settlements shows that well-capitalized banks tend to borrow on better terms and lend more throughout the cycle -- which makes central banks' stimulus efforts more effective.\n\nDuring and after the 2008 crisis, despite falling short of what was needed, the U.K. was ahead of other governments in understanding the importance of capital for a healthy banking system. If the Bank of England wants to show that it has the resolve to protect the economy at a time of great uncertainty, building on that reputation would be better than instituting a quick fix that will make them more fragile."

US$26.95\nBy Steven Martinovich\nweb posted January 23, 2012\nIt has become much in vogue recently to question the long-term sustainability of the U.S. dollar and - by definition - the world economy. From television commercials inviting us to a web site to watch apocalyptic warnings to more academic arguments the message has been pretty clear: These are the end times for the dollar and failing to act will assuredly mean the end of the its role as primary global currency and American economic dominance and prestige. The attributed reasons for this decline may vary depending on the pundit but end result is pretty much the same.\nJames Rickards, who has an extraordinary educational and career resume, recently waded into the debate with the compelling Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis and his effort may be the most distressing yet. Rather than \"simple\" global economic dislocations which end with the United States assuming a second-tier economic role, civilization itself may collapse due to an unfortunate confluence of factors which includes the growing complexity of interconnected economies and civilization, out of control growth of government spending and debt, irresponsible economic policies and currency manipulation, among others.\nRickards argues that we're currently entering the first stages of what argues is the third currency war - the first two occurred in the 20th century - with the primary combatants consisting of the U.S., China and Europe. This currency war, he writes, \"will be truly global and fought on a more massive scale than ever. Currency War III will include both official and private players. ... Today the risk is not just of devaluation of one currency against another or a rise in the price of gold. Today the risk is the collapse of the monetary system itself - a loss of confidence in paper currencies and a massive flight to hard assets.\" That collapse could include civilization itself, he states at several points.\nThe primary catalyst of this latest currency war, Rickards writes, is the ongoing erosion of the U.S. dollar thanks to irresponsible American government spending, a lack of tangible mooring of the U.S. dollar and an American financial services sector that is seemingly allowed to do as it wishes. To complicate matters, stresses in the Chinese economy and that nation's resulting manipulation of the value of the yuan are impacting America's ability to use its traditional weapons to paper over its economic weaknesses. In Europe, codependence on the U.S. dollar and decades of fiscal laxity are threatening to bring down the Eurozone.\nRickards brings all available weapons to bear in an effort to lay out his case. Everything from economics, politics, complexity theory and history are marshalled to support his analysis of the issues and possible solutions. Those solutions include financial industry regulations which include breaking up banks into smaller firms and limiting their abilities to traditional banking services, a reigning in of the size and scope of government, and a return to a modified gold standard. His agenda essentially calls for a leap backwards for Wall Street and the nation's political elite.\nCurrency Wars is very much a worse case effort. Although Rickards does lay out some scenarios where utter collapse can be avoided, \"soft landings\" in the parlance of economists, it's fairly clear that he doesn't hold out much hope that his prescriptions will be taken before it's too late. The forces in control of the world's economic destiny are wedded to the very theories that have brought us to the state we're in and the next economic crisis will, as he states at one point, merely see them add gasoline to the fire. The same tools will be used to combat a collapse which will inevitably see more money spent, government increase and further erosion in the faith of the paper currency.\nCritics will point out that we've been able to deal with past economic crises with the standard toolbox employed by central banks and governments but Rickards makes a credible argument that the favoured hammer isn't enough for the new nail. Even if Rickards' predictions fail to come to pass, that doesn't mean that he's wrong about the disease. It's clear that governments around the world are on unsustainable paths and while we may avoid civilizational collapse we're well-placed to experience an extraordinary hangover from decades of fiscal and political insanity.

Older Americans say no. They also veto reductions in the cost-of-living increase.\nBut a poll finds support among those 50 and older for raising the cap on earnings that are taxed to fund the Social Security program so higher-income workers pay more.\nThe survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds passionate opposition to any change in the way Social Security benefits are calculated that could result in smaller annual raises.\nThe poll found that 62 percent of respondents expressed opposition to such a proposal, compared with 21 percent who supported it.\nThe chained CPI, or consumer price index, has been proposed as a new way of calculating the cost-of-living adjustment, but it would reduce raises.\n\"I really think it's a sacred cow,\" said Margie Nugent, a 55-year-old farmer from North Umberland, Pa. \"They shouldn't touch it.\"\nAbout the same number, 58 percent, oppose gradually raising the age when retirees qualify for full benefits, while 29 percent support it. About one-third believe people should be eligible for full benefits before 65. Only 10 percent say full eligibility should come after 67, the top eligibility age under current law.\n\"I contributed to it. It's my money,\" said Joan McDonald, 65, of Annapolis, Md., who retired as an accountant this year and began collecting Social Security. \"The plan was, `Contribute this and you get this.' You can't change the rules.\"\nSurvey respondents showed more willingness to support Social Security proposals that would mostly impact those with higher incomes.\nForty-one percent expressed support for reducing benefits for seniors with higher incomes, compared with 44 percent who opposed the proposal. Whites were much more supportive of reducing benefits for high-earning seniors than minorities.\nChanges to Social Security are on the horizon because the trust funds that support the massive retirement and disability program are projected to run dry in 2033. At that point, Social Security would only collect enough taxes to pay about three-fourths of benefits. If Congress doesn't act, benefits automatically would be cut by about 25 percent.\nA new round of budget talks underway in Washington could produce proposals to change Social Security.\nIn previous budget talks, President Barack Obama has proposed adopting the chained CPI, making it one of the few issues on which he and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, agree. Other groups, including Obama's 2010 deficit commission, have proposed raising the age when retirees can get full Social Security benefits.\nAmong older Americans, the poll found the most popular idea for improving the program's finances was raising the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes. Currently, the cap is $113,700, meaning those earning more do not pay Social Security taxes on wages above that threshold.\nThe poll found that 61 percent of people favored raising the cap, compared with 25 percent opposing it. Among Democrats, support was at 73 percent; among Republicans, it was 45 percent.\n\"If the rich get richer, they should pay,\" said Rhonda Rossi, 56, of South Bend, Ind. \"If they're multimillionaires, they don't need Social Security. They could live off their interest.\"\nRossi collects Social Security disability benefits of about $950 a month due to kidney failure. Even with that, she struggles to have enough to buy groceries at the end of the month. She says any talk of reducing benefits makes her nervous.\n\"I got sick and if I didn't have the Social Security, I don't know how I would live, I really don't. I'm struggling as it is now,\" she said. The politicians don't live day by day like I do.\"\nThe AP-NORC Center survey was conducted Aug. 8 through Sept. 10 by NORC at the University of Chicago, with funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. It involved landline and cellphone interviews in English and Spanish with 1,024 people aged 50 and older nationwide.

        "webpage": "What Is Gross Value Added?\nOsmand Vitez\nEdited By: Kristen Osborne\nGross value added is an economic measurement used to calculate the productivity of an economy. This measurement works for a specific region, industry, or business sector. It is also used in conjunction with the gross domestic product (GDP) calculation since the gross value added formula includes some of the same basic information. The value added formula is the difference between total economic output and intermediate consumption goods. Private companies can also use the value added formula to determine the benefits from each product line's profitability.The first step in this calculation is to understand the basics of gross domestic product. Gross domestic product represents three items: consumer spending, business investment, and government spending. Consumer spending represents all expenditures in a nation by individual consumers; some business purchases may also be in this figure. Business investments are all large purchases of equipment and facilities for production. Items such as asset exchanges, savings, and securities purchases are typically left out of this number. Government spending is comprised of the expenditures on finished goods and services produced by the private sector. Transfer payments are removed from the government spending portion of a nation's gross domestic product. Ad\nIntermediate consumption goods are the second half of the gross value added formula. Because nations produce a wide variety of goods and services, it is possible that the final output includes products another company uses to produce consumer goods and services. For example, automotive manufacturers need alternators in order to manufacture vehicles. Consumers may find little or no use for an alternator on its own; therefore, the alternator represents an intermediate good since its primary use is by automotive manufacturers. To calculate gross value added, assume the following: $700 US dollars (USD) in consumer spending, $200 USD in business investments, and $100 USD in government spending. Therefore, gross domestic product is $1,000 USD (700 + 200 + 100). Intermediate goods represent $250 USD of the gross domestic product in the above example. Gross value added to the economy is $750 USD (1,000 - 250). The value added figure represents all new production of goods or services to a nation's economy, which can provide a truer picture of economic wealth. To convert this formula for use by a private company, a few changes are necessary. Companies can use this formula to determine how much income a product will contribute to the payment of fixed costs and overall profit. Fixed costs represent loan repayments, rent or lease payments, and salaries. Assume the following: $700 USD in sales, $500 USD in variable costs and $250 in fixed costs. The gross value added is $-50 USD, leaving no money to fully pay fixed costs or make a profit. This formula is similar to the cost/volume/profit analysis used by managerial accountants.

Last year alone its trade surplus with the US reached US$162 billion. By the end of last month, its foreign exchange reserves reached US$711 billion, the second highest in the world. If you add Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves of US$120.8 billion, it actually tops the foreign reserves list.The US, with its great economic strength, once reached out a helping hand to poor countries after World War II. Taiwan was a recipient of US aid. So China's offer was something it should do and was not surprising.Oddly, however, Beijing's offer is not open to Taiwan's diplomatic allies, showing that its purpose was completely different from the goodwill shown by the US. This is another attempt to contain Taiwan's diplomatic efforts. In other words, it is just another attack on Taiwan. The recipients of Chinese aid should really thank Taiwan, without whom there would be no aid forthcoming from Beijing.In addition, recipients of China's aid should understand that the so-called aid comes essentially from Taiwan. After all, most of China's foreign exchange reserves and its trade surplus were acquired through help from Taiwan. Read the following statistics if you do not believe it.According to a report by Ernest Preeg, a senior fellow in the Trade and Productivity Manufacturers Alliance, recently prepared for the congressional US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, \"Taiwan is the largest foreign investor in China, accounting for up to half of total foreign direct investment [FDI].\"\nSince China's FDI reached US$562.1 billion by the end of last year, Taiwan's investment over there was as much as US$281.05 billion.Similarly, the IEEE Spectrum -- a magazine published by the US Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers -- recently pointed out in the article, \"China's Tech Revolution\": \"Ironically, China's ascendance in semiconductors is almost entirely attributable to assistance from Taiwanese technologists.\"On Sept. 18, the media reported that Taiwan's First International Computer Co had closed its last local assembly line, which was also the last line for the nation's notebook computer industry, thus completely relocating to China.This sector has been one of the nation's most important electronic sectors over the past decade. In 2001, its output value ratio was 89 percent domestically and 4 percent in China. By last year, its output value ratio was 16 percent domestically and 82 percent in China. It is this sort of thing that has allowed China to supplant Taiwan as the kingdom of laptop computer manufacturing.The total output value of Chinese information technology (IT) hardware is US$60.5 billion, which is the world's second highest and accounts for a large portion of China's exports. But 79 percent of it is contributed by Taiwanese businesses, showing that much of China's trade surplus is created by Taiwanese businesspeople.In other words, China's economic achievement and the foreign aid it is able to offer are a result of Taiwanese \"support.\""

Exporting has many potential benefits, as such enterprises can learn more easily and adopt new technologies and production techniques from abroad, expand their market and customer base, diversify into related products and optimize their production capacity. However, the indirect participation in trade by selling products or services to other domestic companies that export may be easier than exporting directly because it does not require an export infrastructure, is less risky and demands less investment.\nVarious obstacles do, however, hold back the direct and indirect internationalization of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the region. One obstacle is the limited funds and lack of access to bank credit. Other factors include low productivity owing to inefficient production techniques, complicated formalities and paperwork required for export operations, difficulties in meeting quality standards, and non-tariff barriers to export to developed countries. As several case studies have illustrated, however, public policies may improve the enterprises' success in exporting clusters or value chains.\nIn the region, the formulation, targeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the policies of small- and medium-sized enterprises is hindered by the inefficient use or lack of data on the characteristics, productivity and international trade orientation of small firms. It is therefore essential to make better use of existing data and to design methods to evaluate the enterprises' participation in outward-oriented value chains. Asia offers several examples of best practices in this area.\nECLAC has developed methodologies and databases to improve the evaluation of competitiveness of the small- and medium-sized enterprises; has worked on addressing their financing difficulties and organized training workshops in this area; and has provided technical assistance on assessing financing difficulties and on innovative forms of credit.\nThe ECLAC Division of International Trade and Integration will implement the project in collaboration with the Commission's Division of Production, Productivity and Management and Development Studies Unit, and with the Commission's subregional headquarters in Mexico. ESCAP, ILO and UNCTAD will also be invited to participate in the training workshops and two high-level subregional meetings.\nTo strengthen government capacities in participating countries to design and implement effective policies to promote SME internationalization, including access to credit and other financial services.\nExpected accomplishments:\nIncreased capacity of government authorities to measure SME internationalization performance.\nImproved capacity of government authorities to design and implement effective policies/programs to foster innovation among SMEs, in coordination with the private sector.\nImproved capacity of government authorities to design and implement effective policies/programs to address SME constraints regarding financial services, in coordination with the private sector.

        "webpage": "Economy China: Economic Work Conference Statement Stresses Reforms, Reasonable Economic Growth For 2014\nBy Moran Zhang @moranzhang on December 13 2013 11:30 AM EST\nChinese President Xi Jinping (2nd from left). Getty Images China's Communist Party Chief Xi Jinping arrives before the opening ceremony of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, March 5, 2013. REUTERS/Jason Lee Previous\nChina wrapped up a key economic conference Friday, with the government stressing the need to push ahead with reforms while also ensuring reasonable economic growth.\nAll the seven standing committee members of the Politburo attended the closed-door annual Economic Work Conference, which was held over four days this week. According to a statement carried by state media after the end of the meeting, China's macro policy stance remains \"pro-active fiscal policy\" and \"prudent monetary policy.\"\nThe conference recognizes the stabilization and gradual improvement in economic growth this year. Meanwhile, it highlights that the Chinese economy still faces downward pressure, as some industries experience serious overcapacity problems, with complications in the labor markets, deterioration in the environment and problems of food and medicine safety as well as social unrest.\nThe official document, read on state radio and television, referred to the crucial role of consumption as an economic driver of the future. China will \"make efforts to free up demand, give full play to the fundamental role of consumption, the pivotal role of investment and the supporting role of exports,\" the statement said.\nSimilar to last year, the Economic Work Conference did not specify the gross domestic product growth and inflation targets for 2014. Although these key economic targets for 2013 were accurately leaked in 2012 shortly after the conference, they were officially revealed at the National People's Congress in March this year.\nThe GDP target was 7.5 percent in 2012 and \"about 7.5 percent\" this year. The difference reflects a subtle downgrading of the target as a policy goal. Officials, including Premier Li Keqiang, have started to talk of two \"bottom lines,\" the other being for employment.\nA recent Reuters poll showed Chinese GDP growth this year could slow to 7.6 percent -- the weakest in 14 years. Beijing had maintained an annual growth target of 8 percent for eight years before cutting it to 7.5 percent in 2012.\nEconomists had been looking for signs of whether China would maintain a target of 7.5 percent growth for next year or lower it to a more attainable 7 percent - a target that would signal Beijing's determination to deepen reform efforts.\nThe conference laid out six major targets for next year's economic policy: 1) Ensure stable supply and quality of agricultural products and food safety; 2) Speed up industrial structural adjustment and resolve overcapacity problems; 3) Prevent risks from local government debt; 4) Push for coordinative regional developments; 5) Raise the average living standard and support affordable housing programs; and 6) Further open up the economy, push ahead with free trade zone negotiations.\nThe statement mentioned that the central leading group on deepening reform, initiated at the 3rd Plenary Session last month, will be led by the Political Bureau and the Standing Committee members, the party's highest echelon. Reform leading units also will be set up at the local government levels, to be led by key officials.\n\"Overall, there is no major surprise in the statement from the economic work conference,\" J.P. Morgan Greater China Economic Research team led by Grace Ng wrote in a note. \"The tone on macro policy is consistent with our policy outlook for 2014.\"\nJPMorgan expects China's economic growth pace to ease from 7.6 percent in 2013 to 7.4 percent in 2014, with modest easing in investment growth, relatively solid consumption and some moderate upturn in the export sector, supported by the global economic recovery.\nCPI inflation is projected to move up gradually in 2014, but at a moderate and manageable pace. The firm has penciled in a 2014 average inflation rate of 3.3 percent, compared with an expected rate of 2.7 percent for this year.\nChina 2014: An Important Year For Its Reform Agenda Clues To Beijing's Thinking Join the Discussion"

        "webpage": "Japan seeks to join U.S.-led Pacific trade talks, reform hopes rise\n3/14/2013 10:12:32 PM - Reuters News\nBy Kaori Kaneko TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Friday that Tokyo will seek to join talks on a U.S.-led Pacific free trade pact which proponents say will help tap vibrant regional growth, open Japan to tougher competition and create momentum for reforms needed to revive the long-stagnant economy. The decision to join talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) launches the \"third arrow\" in Abe's policy triad following the fiscal pump priming and hyper-easy monetary measures he has pushed since returning to office in December after his Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) big election win. \"Emerging countries in Asia are shifting to an open economy one after another. If Japan alone remains an inward-looking economy, there would be no chance for growth,\" Abe told a news conference. \"This is our last chance. If we miss this opportunity, Japan will be left behind.\" The government estimates that joining the TPP will boost Japan's gross domestic product by 3.2 trillion yen ($33.3 billion), or 0.66 percentage points, offsetting the negative impact on agriculture by boosting exports in other sectors and domestic private consumption. \"Abenomics\" has been playing to rave reviews in the Tokyo stock market and with voters, around 70 percent of whom support the prime minister. Business executives and economists say the real test, though, will be whether Abe buckles down to more controversial reforms such as deregulation, which can hurt vested interests. \"TPP could be a trigger for Japan to implement deregulation in various sectors by using external pressure,\" said Hideo Kumamo, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. \"It is being seen as a way to stimulate the economy by making the nation more competitive.\" The United States and 10 other countries are pushing for a deal by the end of the year and possibly as soon as an Asia-Pacific leaders summit in Bali in October. Much of the attention has focused on political hot-button issues such as scrapping tariffs on farm products and textiles. But negotiators are also grappling with thorny matters such as rules on disputes between companies and governments, state-owned enterprises, copyright protection, access to financial and other service sectors, cross-border transfer of electronic data and protection for workers from trade-related fallout. Hurdles remain to Japan's entry to the talks. Tokyo must first hold bilateral meetings with existing members and be supported by a consensus to \"keep up the good momentum\" as the countries prepare for the next talks in Peru, said Singapore negotiator Ng Bee Kim after the 16th round of the three-year-old talks ended on Wednesday. Other countries in the trade talks include Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. The ratio of Japan's trade covered by free trade agreements was about 19 percent in 2011, compared with 35 percent for South Korea, 38 percent in the United States and 32 percent in the European Union, according to the most recent government data. MORE THAN TRADE \"It's a mistake to think that TPP is just aimed at stimulating free trade,\" Lawson Inc CEO Takeshi Niinami, a member of a government panel on competitiveness, told Reuters last week. \"This will create a huge opportunity for revitalizing Japan.\" Japanese big business wants Tokyo to join the pact to keep from falling further behind rivals such as China and South Korea, while traditional LDP supporters such as farmers are generally opposed. An LDP panel on Thursday gave Abe a resolution calling for protection of sensitive items such as agriculture products and Japan's universal healthcare system and demanding that the government withdraw from the trade talks if it cannot. With strong approval ratings for now, Abe appears to be betting he can decide to join the TPP talks even if at the risk of angering some voters ahead of a July upper house poll that his ruling bloc needs to win to cement its grip on power. Economists said the immediate economic impact of joining TPP would likely be limited but that taking part would allow Japan to help set the rules. Two of Abe's predecessors from the now-opposition Democratic Party of Japan promoted the idea of joining TPP but were unable to get full backing from their party. Abe could fare better. \"He is a unifying force and I think the environment is such that LDP lawmakers find it hard to disagree strongly,\" a government official said.

Leaders need to step away from purely domestic concerns, and ensure they're not threatening the world's economy further by imposing dangerous protectionist measures.\nIn attempting to secure their own economies, it's imperative that world leaders resist the temptation of protectionism. There is hope: we have a rule-based world trading system in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a United States Administration that is ready to re-adopt a Keynesian policy to counter the busmess cycles, alongside other governments. But this crisis situation is worse than anything in post-war history, and it is befitting to remind ourselves how bad things did get.\nLearning from history\nFrom the collapse of 1929, it took the United States a whole decade, indeed to 1939, to get back to where it was in terms of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). At the worst point in its history, four years after the first Wall Street crisis broke, the country's economy had shrunk by as much as 29%, Under pressure to protect farmers and industries, the Umted States Congress produced the Tariff Act of 1930, commonly known as the SmootHawley tariff.\nThis legislation prompted foreign retaliation, which plunged the world deeper into the Great Depression. Smoot-Hawley now is shorthand for the beggar-thy-neighbour policies of the 1930s. Overall, world trade declined by some 66% between 1929 and 1934 (see Chart 1).\nWestern Europe went through an equally devastating crisis, although recovery started earlier: in 1932 for the United Kingdom and 1933 for Germany. Of course, this recovery was not sustained; the German war-economy finally crumbled in 1944 and it lost two-thirds of its GDP over the following two years.\nNow is the time to resist protectionism\nFighting protectionism does not address the causes of the cnsis - for that we need to change the culture of lax risk-management in a booming financial sector. But rejecting protectionism will help to limit transmission of the crisis to other parts of the globe, notably the developing and emerging economies.\nSuch transmission is happening in any case, but we need to limit its contagion, Trade is the engine of global growth and it is sputtering - the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) recent forecast speaks of a decline in world trade of 13%, The recent Spring Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank yielded its bleakest global growth and trade prognosis since the creation of the Bretton Woods system back in 1944.\nThe ITC Trade Map uses high-frequency data to gauge the impact. The United States trade data reveal a steep import contraction: whereas imports had historically been increasing by some US$40 billion a month, they were contracting by $58 billion in February 2009 (see Chart 2).\nThe monthly export data for African and Asian emerging and developing countries, hugely relying on OECD locomotive growth, paint a bleak picture. ...

        "webpage": "comments Bank of Japan maintains policy, cheers Abenomics By Charles Riley @CRrileyCNN May 22, 2013: 12:39 AM ET Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda has helped institute an aggressive quantitative easing plan. HONG KONG (CNNMoney) Japan's central bank pledged Wednesday to maintain its ambitious quantitative easing program, saying that economic conditions in the country are improving. \"Japan's economy has started picking up,\" the Bank of Japan said in a statement, citing improvement in exports, consumer spending and private investment. The central bank announced in April that it would expand its balance sheet by purchasing longer-term debt and securities like ETFs. The bank also merged its asset-purchase programs and suspended a rule that prohibited the purchase of longer-term debt. The new purchases -- made at an annual pace of 60 - 70 trillion yen -- will double the bank's monetary base over a two-year period. The bank affirmed those policies Wednesday. \"Such conduct of monetary policy will support the positive movements in economic activity and financial markets, contribute to a rise in inflation expectations, and lead Japan's economy to overcome deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years,\" the bank said in its policy statement. But the BoJ did not address the recent rise in yields on Japanese government bonds, a worrisome trend that could undermine the bank's stimulus efforts. Related story: 7 big winners in Nikkei surge Still, the bank's rosy outlook should provide a boost to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's reform efforts. Dubbed \"Abenomics,\" the initiatives include aggressive central bank action and increased government spending. The idea is that the combined measures could push up prices and end years of deflation, leading to more robust growth for the world's third largest economy. Related story: Is Abenomics working? Markets have already responded to the stimulus measures, with the yen falling around 30% against the dollar since November, and the Nikkei rising to a five-year high while breaking the 15,000 point barrier. Short skirts and economics in Japan The remaining pillar of the Abenomics strategy -- structural reforms -- could prove to be the most beneficial over the long-term, if also the most difficult to implement. Abe's government has proposed reforms that would make the labor market more flexible, encourage immigration, bring nuclear power plants back online and draw more Japanese women into the workforce. Implementing the reforms in a timely manner will require close coordination with interest groups, sustained public support and deft political maneuvering by Abe's government. Last week, Japan's government reported an annual growth rate of 3.5% for the first three months of 2013, a much quicker expansion than the 2.7% increase expected by analysts.

See Offers Columns Posted July 7, 2014\nOff Campus: Why China's economic challenges matter to the United States\nThe U.S. will have to move in the opposite direction of the Chinese to take advantage of China's increasing consumption. Share\nComment Read Article The World Bank projects that China will soon overtake the United States as the world's largest economy, a remarkable achievement considering just 40 years ago the Great Wall of China served as a symbol for an impoverished country cut off from the rest of the world. Despite this extraordinary accomplishment, China faces daunting social and economic challenges.\nIn a keynote address at the Confucius Institute Conference in Beijing last December, the Chinese Nobel laureate, Mo Yan, described the tension between China's success and its challenges by contrasting the views of his 90-year-old father with those of his 30-year-old nieces and nephews.\nDr. Joseph McDonnell is dean of the College of Management and Human Service and director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Southern Maine.\nSearch photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\nHaving lived through civil and foreign wars, pervasive poverty and cultural upheaval, Mo's father appreciates living in a peaceful and relatively prosperous country. Today, China is unquestionably the best it has ever been during his long lifetime.\nIts prosperity can be attributed to an economic policy that took advantage of the country's abundant cheap labor to become the workshop of the world, exporting goods to the far corners of the globe and investing the proceeds in foreign debt and building the country's infrastructure.\nMo Yan's nephews and nieces, on the other hand, are far more critical, pointing to corruption and the lack of opportunity for young people. They see a society marked by rising income inequality, ecological degradation, expensive housing, inadequate health insurance and meager social security for the elderly.\nMo Yan acknowledged the legitimacy of both views. His father's perspective sees the progress achieved over nearly a century, while the younger generation suffers from the consequences of a society that has moved rapidly into modernity.\nMo Yan labeled the long view of his father \"the vertical perspective\" - seeing the country through the lens of its history.\nHe called the critical view of the younger generation \"the horizontal perspective\" - comparing the country to its contemporaries. Each view captures a fundamental truth about the country.\nChina's progress can be traced to the reform agenda promulgated by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in opening the country to international trade. Over a 30-year period from 1980 to 2010, China's gross national product increased an eye-popping average of 10 percent each year.\nChina produced, and the United States, Europe and other parts of the developed world consumed - a mutual relationship that served the interests of all parties.\nIn 2007, even before the Great Recession made it clear that consumption in the West stood on a shaky foundation, then-Premier Wen Jiabao questioned China's strategy by calling its economy unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable.\nWen backed up these assertions by pointing to excessive liquidity; cities growing at the expense of farms; rapid development of the country's east coast, leaving behind the rest of the nation; an overdependence on manufacturing for export; an underdeveloped service sector; lagging domestic consumption; environmental pollution, and widening disparities in wealth.\nEconomist and longtime China observer Stephen Roach, in his recent book, \"Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China,\" draws out the implications of Wen Jiabao's insights for both China and the United States. Roach explains that the world's two largest economies are mutually dependent and not sustainable.\nChina must pivot toward cleaner manufacturing, a more vibrant service sector and increased domestic consumption. It will have to devote more resources toward boosting personal income, health care and social security.\nPersonal income in China now averages just $6,639 per year- insufficient to create a nation of consumers. China will have to divert some of its wealth currently allocated to purchasing our debt to achieve these objectives\nAs China rebalances, the United States will have to rebalance as well. The United States will have to move in the opposite direction of the Chinese rebalancing by reducing our excessive consumption, increasing our savings and exporting goods and services to take advantage of increases in China's consumption.\nWhile exports comprise 27 percent of the Chinese economy, they make up less than 14 percent of ours. And while the service sector dominates our economy, accounting for 63 percent of our gross domestic product, it accounts for only 43 percent in China. Each economy will have to move incrementally closer to the other's profile.\nMo Yan's nieces and nephews have much in common with their counterparts in the United States. The economies of both societies are not providing enough good jobs for young people. As China takes a step toward increasing its service sector and its domestic consumption, the United States must recognize this shift in our interdependency. We ought to work with China to make this transition mutually beneficial.\n -  Special to the Press Herald"

        "webpage": "Swiss Bank Finds Itself Under American Scrutiny By Jim Zarroli\nOriginally published on February 27, 2014 12:08 pm Transcript MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Top executives at one of Switzerland's biggest banks said today they're sincerely trying to prevent tax evasion by U.S. citizens. They also said conflicting laws in the two countries make it almost impossible to do that. The chief executive of Credit Suisse appeared before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has been looking into the use of secret Swiss bank accounts by Americans. Here's NPR's Jim Zarroli. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: In 2009, the subcommittee began a marathon investigation into overseas tax havens, one that eventually led to the prosecution of the Swiss bank UBS. At the time, says subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin of Michigan, it looked as though the world was ready to crack down on secret accounts. SENATOR CARL LEVIN: Well, it's five years later and the sad truth is that the era of bank secrecy is not over. Bank secrecy has been discredited and condemned but it isn't gone. ZARROLI: Before him sat Brady Dougan who, despite being American himself, is CEO of Credit Suisse. The subcommittee says Credit Suisse at one time had 22,000 accounts held by Americans, the vast majority of which were never disclosed to the IRS. Dougan conceded that a few rogue bankers had helped American accountholders conceal their assets. But he said the bank as a whole remains committed to complying with U.S. law. BRADY DOUGAN: And for me personally, it has been one of my highest priorities to get this fixed, to get it right, and I believe we have made significant progress towards that goal. ZARROLI: But Dougan and other executives pointed out that the Senate had yet to ratify what's called the Double Taxation Treaty. The agreement would establish a process enabling the U.S. to get the names of tax evaders with Swiss accounts in some cases. Until the treaty is ratified, Credit Suisse officials insisted that the bank is caught between a rock and a hard place. General Counsel Romeo Cerutti said the bank wants to obey U.S. regulations. ROMEO CERUTTI: This has not been easy. Given that we need to comply with the laws of both United States and Switzerland and these laws are sometimes directly conflicting. ZARROLI: Under questioning by Arizona Senator John McCain, Cerutti says current Swiss law continues to block the release of accountholders' names in most cases. CERUTTI: This is subject to imprisonment and fines. So... SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN: And so, any real idea that the government of Switzerland is cooperating with us is a joke, right? ZARROLI: Meanwhile, Senator Levin insisted that banks such as Credit Suisse are hiding behind Swiss law. If they want to do business in the United States, he said they have to comply with U.S. regulations. As for the Double Taxation Treaty, Levin said it will have at best a limited impact on curbing tax evasion. For one thing, he says it doesn't apply to accounts opened before 2009. LEVIN: It doesn't apply to thousands of accounts of people who owe us money. And that means that we lose billions of dollars in tax collections and that's unacceptable to us. ZARROLI: Levin and other senators also criticized the Justice Department, saying it hadn't pursued tax invaders aggressively enough. But Justice Department officials said, since 2009, they have charged 73 bank customers and 35 executives and advisors for tax evasion. And they are investigating 14 Swiss banks that could be indicted down the road. Jim Zarroli, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: This is NPR News.

Just ten years ago, internet connectivity was only starting to become common. Digitization is changing how people trade. There are even more dramatic changes happening under the hood. The way trade is financed, processed and regulated has entered a period of disruption. We take this opportunity to consider the short and long-term implications of digitization of the trade process.\n\nAlthough the Coalition government has been reinstated, it is still faced with the problem of dealing with multinational tax avoidance. The issue escaped a lot of scrutiny during the election campaign and the current measures designed to address the issue fail to deal with the most common form of avoidance - interest deductions on intra-group debt.\n\nThe FTSE Italian bank index was down nearly 40% this year through the day of the UK referendum. It fell another 33% from the results of the referendum to the middle of last week.\n\nIn recent days, investors appear to have become more optimistic that the political will from the EU and Italy is sufficient to avert a full-fledged banking crisis. The FTSE Italian bank index rose almost 8% today, posting its fourth consecutive advancing session, over which time it has risen about 24%. It leaves the bank index off around 18% since June 24.\n\nLast month, the Federal Reserve announced that 31 out of 33 U.S. banks had passed its latest \"stress test,\" designed to ensure that the largest financial institutions have enough capital to withstand a severe economic shock.\n\nAfter the 2007-2008 bank recapitalization by governments, which means taxpayers' money, Europe changed the rules. The new rules require that private investors be \"bailed in\" before the bank is \"bailed out.\"\n\nEurope's fastidious with rules allows for exceptions and flexibility. Italy is pushing for this flexibility now, and Portugal is watching closely because its largest bank also may require recapitalization.\n\nNew standards on how much businesses can surcharge their customers for credit or debit card purchases start in September. However, it's not clear how the rules will be policed and whether this will lead to all businesses enforcing a surcharge, rather than just those who choose to.\n\nHow exceptional are market developments? Much rests on the answer. If these are extraordinary circumstances, then Japanese intervention becomes more likely. Of course, Japanese policymakers have been inclined to intervene before the UK referendum but were seemingly rebuffed by its G7 partners.\n\nIn Europe, the designation of \"exceptional circumstances\" is critical. Such a designation could soften the EU strictures. Italy is on the leading the push in this direction.\n\nIn India's most recent budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley formally announced that it would slash the number of Indian public sector banks from the current 27 to just 10. Consolidating India's public sector banks will result in improved efficiency, greater economies of scale and large-scale financial institutions that can cater to the needs of a growing economy.\n\nLarge established firms increasingly rely on external sources for innovation. One way these firms are seeking to foster innovative activity is via corporate venture capital programs.\n\nAccording to the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), established firms invested more than US$4 billion in venture businesses in 2014, representing more than 10% of all venture capital investments in the US during the year.\n\nThe idea of separating out the arms of the \"Big Four\" banks like insurance and superannuation from their core banking business is gaining traction in Australia. It featured in the Greens' banking and finance election policy. However, this is not a new idea; Australia is just catching up to banking reforms already made by the UK.\n\nDue to innovations in financial technology and changes in the enabling environment, the number of financially excluded adults across Asia and the Pacific has dropped to about 1 billion.\n\nIncreased access to affordable financial services can be a lever for Asians to smooth consumption, manage risk and improve their lives through better savings options, access to credit, and cheaper payments or remittances.\n\nAny change in taxation invariably raises questions about distribution.

The second season will run from November 1, 2013 to October 31, 2014.\nThe insurance scheme aims to provide a rapid injection of funds in the event of a major disaster, to help governments manage the immediate costs of recovery. Access to post-disaster finance can be especially important for Pacific island countries which endure some of the highest average annual losses from natural hazards in the world - up to 6.6% of GDP.\n\"Becoming a member of the Pacific catastrophe risk insurance program provides us with an innovative way to work with other countries in the region and transfer some of the catastrophe risk borne by Pacific island nations to the international reinsurance market,\" said Mark Brown, Minister of Finance and Economic Management for the Cook Islands. \"This transaction provides us with another tool towards becoming self-reliant in disaster management, response and recovery.\"\nThe scheme's expansion follows the request of countries during this year's Forum Economic Ministers Meeting in Tonga to grow the program beyond the five pilot countries. Aggregate insurance coverage of the participating countries has increased from US$45 million to US$67 million, with further premium reductions for participating countries.\n\"The expansion of the insurance pilot in the Pacific is a positive sign towards the long-term sustainability of the program,\" said Franz Drees-Gross, Country Director for the Pacific Islands at the World Bank. \"Rapid access to emergency funds can be crucial for governments in the wake of a disaster when time is of the essence, and catastrophe insurance could play an important part in this process.\"\nAs in the first pilot season, the World Bank will act as an intermediary between Pacific island countries and a group of reinsurance companies, which were selected through a competitive bidding process - Sompo Japan Insurance, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance and Swiss Re. AIR Worldwide provides the underlying risk modeling for the transaction.\nLaunched on 17 January 2013, the pilot is made possible through the collective efforts of the Government of Japan, the World Bank, and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC). It tests a risk transfer arrangement modeled on an insurance plan, and uses 'parametric triggers', such as cyclone intensity or earthquake magnitude to determine payouts, which enable quick disbursements. The international reinsurance market has responded positively to the scheme, and has underwritten the portfolio of Pacific catastrophe risks at competitive prices.\nThe Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot is part of the broader Pacific Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI) program that is designed to increase the financial resilience of Pacific island countries against natural disasters by improving their capacity to meet post-disaster funding needs. Through this program advisory services are available to Pacific island countries for public financial management of natural disasters, including (i) the development of a national disaster risk financing strategy, recognizing the need for ex-ante and ex-post financial tools; (ii) post disaster budget execution, to ensure that funds can be accessed and disbursed easily post disaster; and (iii) the insurance of key public assets, to contribute to post disaster reconstruction financing.\nThe Pacific DRFI Program is part of the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), a joint initiative of the World Bank, SPC, and the Asian Development Bank with financial support from the Government of Japan, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and the European Union. PCRAFI, launched in 2007, aims to provide the Pacific island nations with disaster risk assessment and financing tools for enhanced disaster risk management and climate change adaptation.\nMedia ContactsIn SydneyLaura\nKeenanTel : (612) \nSmithiesTel : (612) \nIn TokyoTomoko\nHiraiTel : +81 (03) \nPacific Islands East Asia and Pacific LATEST NEWS"

        "webpage": "After a disappointing 5.1% in 2014, Indonesia's economic growth is expected to accelerate by around 6% in 2015.\n\nPolitical situation\n\nHead of state/government: President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo (Indonesian Democratic Party - Struggle), since October 2014\n\nGovernment type: Republic\n\nForm of government: Multi-party coalition government\n\nA new and more reform-minded president in office\n\nIndonesia held legislative and presidential elections in 2014. July's presidential election was won by Joko Widodo (popularly known as 'Jokowi'), the governor of Jakarta. In the political offices he has held so far, as mayor of Surakarta and governor of Jakarta, he has proved to be a successful reformer and fighter against corruption. Corruption, vested interests and resource nationalism are persistent obstacles to badly needed structural economic reforms and Jokowi's presidency is seen as the best chance to address these issues.\n\nHowever, he needs the support of smaller parties in the House of Representatives and the legislative elections have left a very fragmented political scene. Jokowi's Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P) holds only 19% of the seats in the House and a coalition of at least four parties is needed to gain an absolute majority. This is likely to hinder structural reforms. Meanwhile, the defeated presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto has shown no willingness to engage in constructive parliamentary opposition but instead seems to be doing his utmost to undermine Jokowi's policy making.\n\nEconomic situation\n\nDeep structural problems persist\n\nEconomic growth was disappointing in 2014, at only 5.1% GDP, partly as a result of an export ban on unprocessed minerals and also because of political uncertainty ahead of the general and presidential elections. Nevertheless, growth is expected to accelerate in 2015: by a forecast of around 6%. Higher incomes - the result of years of good economic performance - have contributed to the rise of the middle class in Indonesia (estimated to number more than 30 million in a country of 242 million) and this will also bolster domestic consumer spending in the short and medium term.\n\nDespite the generally satisfactory growth rates, there are still deep structural problems, with red tape, widespread corruption, a poor legal system, an inflexible labour market and poor infrastructure all continuing to limit growth. There are still too many barriers to foreign direct investment (FDI), which is severely hampered by the poor infrastructure and energy supply, and so it is no surprise that investment in oil extraction capacity and infrastructure remains disappointing.\n\nFuel subsidies have at last been cut\n\nThe annual budget deficit has increased since 2010, due in large part to costly fuel subsidies that account for more than 15% of the national budget. These subsidies also eat into public spending for necessary infrastructure investment and social spending, endangering long-term fiscal sustainability. Each year, more public money is spent on fuel subsidies than on social programmes and capital expenditures combined.\n\nIn November 2014 President Jokowi finally decided to cut subsidies for gasoline and diesel, raising fuel prices by about 30% to relieve the public budget. Fuel prices are a very sensitive issue in Indonesia, where about 100 million people live on US $2 a day or less, and in the past even modest increases have resulted in social unrest. To contain inflation after the fuel price increase, the Central Bank increased the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, to 7.75%. Finally, on January 1st 2015 gasoline subsidies were scrapped entirely and subsidies for diesel were capped, taking advantage of decreasing oil prices. This move is expected to relieve the national budget and to allow the government to increase spending on infrastructure improvement, healthcare and education.\n\nMore vulnerable external position than in the past\n\nThe country's economic fundamentals are still strong. The foreign debt level remains manageable and liquidity is adequate. But Indonesia's external position is now more vulnerable than in the past because of its current account deficit and higher private sector external debt.\n\nIn 2014, Indonesia did not experience a recurrence of the massive international capital outflow of 2013, when the currency came under pressure as the US Federal Reserve tapered its bond-buying programme and foreign investors sold off financial assets and shares. However, the rupiah may come under renewed pressure in the future.\n\nThe cut in fuel subsidies is a start, but more structural reforms and a reduction in the external financing requirement are necessary. Without reforms to resolve the structural economic problems, the economic growth rate will remain below its potential.\n\nThe statements made herein are provided solely for general informational purposes and should not be relied upon for any purpose.

That means that it's possible to adapt excellent writing for television but not the reverse. In Money & Power: The History of Business, author Howard Means has adapted a CNBC documentary into a book that provides little of value to one seeking a serious treatment of business history. The breezily written book manages to be insubstantial and infuriating at the same time.\nMeans attempts to tell the history of business through a series of essays on famous individuals or episodes. The choice of subjects is predictable; the Medicis, the tulip bubble, J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, and so on. Unfortunately, so is the sorry economic analysis. Means indulges in the usual demonization of entrepreneurial effort, characterizing innovation as \"cutthroat competition\" and employing loaded terms like \"robber baron\" with little regard for fine distinctions or economic rationality. It's the kind of book that has been misleading Americans about the role and nature of business for generations.\nThe essay on Rockefeller is particularly galling. Means indulges in various tirades about Rockefeller's \"ruthlessness and unsentimentality\" (meaning his relentless efforts to reduce the price of oil, that scalawag!) and his corrupt \"buying\" of the politicians of the day. These were the same politicians who had erected the trade restrictions that Rockefeller's trusts and other innovations were meant to evade. Paying intrusive or tyrannical politicians to leave him alone probably seemed to Rockefeller to be a perfectly reasonable expenditure of his and his shareholders' money. Means can only see corruption, missing entirely the fact that the evasion of anticompetitive regulations was economically beneficial.\nIf Means had really wanted to tell the story of the history of business, he might have explained Rockefeller's dilemma in greater detail. Before inventing the modern trust, he had already amassed a considerable fortune by refining and marketing oil more efficiently than anyone else. One secret to his success was a waste-not strategy that sought to use every by-product of the refining process. His chemists came up with 300 different uses for a barrel of oil. Rockefeller also pioneered vertical integration. His partnership with Henry Flagler and Samuel Andrews not only refined oil but also harvested and dried timber, transported it to factories, and then produced the barrels necessary to haul the oil.\nFive years after the founding of their refining plant in 1865, the price of kerosene had dropped by 50 percent. Rockefeller's ceaseless pursuit of lower prices drove other refiners out of business, many of which he then acquired. By 1880, his company controlled 80 percent of the kerosene business. Contrary to the predictions of those with a simplistic view of markets, such as Means, Rockefeller could not then rest on his laurels and run a high-priced monopoly. Kerosene itself had competitors, including whale oil and electricity. Furthermore, there was always the possibility of new entrants to the kerosene market. So Rockefeller pushed on. By the time the company reached 90 percent of market share five years later, it had driven prices down another 69 percent, to 8 cents a gallon.\nAlthough hardly helpful to Rockefeller's competitors, his business acumen was immensely beneficial to industry as a whole and to the American (and world) consumer. But does Means undermine his attack by mentioning the fact that Standard Oil made life much better for the consumer? Of course not.\nOn the other hand, Means seems to vindicate him only by reporting what, to Means at least, was a puzzling contradiction: Rockefeller's philanthropy. The implicit message is that making lots of money is bad, but at least it can then be given away.\nMeans does the same for Henry Ford, whom he badly maligns, by explaining that the Ford Foundation's \"general support for a variety of liberal and social-welfare programs (causes Ford himself might well have loathed) would help buff the image of the automaker.\"\nAre we to understand that an entrepreneur who created his great fortune by serving humanity well, through innovation and hard work, needed his image improved by having his fortune squandered by others, against his expressed wishes, on left-wing projects of dubious merit?\nAnyone who would suggest such a thing lacks the insight necessary to explain the history of business. Others have performed the task far better, including Gerald Gunderson's excellent The Wealth Creators and Larry Schweikart's The Entrepreneurial Adventure: A History of Business in the United States.\nRead those books and skip the disinformative Wealth and Power.\nJohn Hood is president of the John Locke Foundation, a public-policy think tank in North Carolina. His books include The Heroic Enterprise: Business and the Common Good (The Free Press, 1996) and Investor Politics (Templeton Foundation Press, 2001)."

        "webpage": "Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" is a gooey confection of seasonal sentiment. It also is an economic manifesto that Dickens hoped would hit with \"twenty thousand times the force\" of a political tract. It concerned a 19th-century debate that is pertinent to today's argument about immigration. Last week, a disagreement between two conservative think tanks erupted when the Heritage Foundation excoriated the immigration reform proposed by a bipartisan group of eight senators. Heritage's analysis argues that making 11 million illegal immigrants eligible, more than a decade from now, for welfare state entitlements would have net costs (benefits received minus taxes paid) of $6.3 trillion over the next 50 years. Fifty-year projections about this or that are not worth the paper they should never have been printed on -- think of what 1963 did not know about 2013. Why, then, Heritage's 50-year time horizon? Because 50 years of any significant expenditure is an attention-getting number. And because for more than a decade legalized immigrants would be a net fiscal plus, paying taxes but not receiving benefits. The libertarian Cato Institute says Heritage insufficiently acknowledges immigration's contributions to economic growth (new businesses, replenishing the workforce as baby boomers retire, etc.). This dynamism, Cato argues, will propel immigrants' upward mobility, reducing the number eligible for means-tested entitlements. Conservatives correctly criticize those who reject \"dynamic scoring\" of tax cuts. Such a calculation of the revenue effects of cuts includes assumptions about the effect on economic growth from changed behavior in response to the cuts -- especially increased investment and consumption. Opponents of dynamic scoring usually are opponents of tax cuts. Similarly, opponents of increased immigration downplay what Cato stresses -- immigration's energizing effects. Which brings us to Dickens' revolt against Thomas Malthus' pre-capitalist pessimism about the possibility of growth and abundance. \"A Christmas Carol\" expresses Dickens' modernist rejection of Malthus' theory that population always grows faster than the food supply, so the poor must always be numerous and miserable. When told that many of the poor \"would rather die\" than go to the workhouse, Scrooge replies: \"If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\" But when Scrooge recognizes that Tiny Tim might be part of this surplus, he repents, giving Tim's father, Bob Cratchit, a raise and a Christmas turkey. This was Dickens' representation of the modern triumph of economics over fatalism about social stasis. Sentimental? Certainly. But also expressive of the 19th century's revolution of expectations. As Sylvia Nasar says in \"Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius\" (2011), the second half of the 19th century saw \"one of the most radical discoveries of all time,\" the recognition that mankind's \"circumstances were not predetermined, immutable, or utterly impervious to human intervention.\" This called for \"cheer and activity rather than pessimism and resignation.\" Unfortunately, today's immigration debate occurs during an uncharacteristic American mood of pessimism. Next month, the anemic recovery from the Great Recession will be four years old, and many Americans seem resigned to slow growth, sluggish job creation and stalled social mobility. Hence their forebodings about immigration. Economic facts matter. But the material ascent of humanity since the 19th century demonstrates that economic facts are not constants, like the law of gravity. Rather, they can respond to induced dynamism, as from immigration. America is, however, more than an economy, it also is a civic culture. Today's entitlement state, which encourages an entitlement mentality, may or may not be a powerful magnet for immigration; it certainly changes the context of immigration. Furthermore, European immigrants crossing the Atlantic experienced a \"psychological guillotine\" severing them from their homeland and encouraging Americanization. Crossing the Rio Grande from a contiguous nation is not a comparable prod toward assimilation. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a critic of the proposed reform, rightly warns of immigrants exerting downward pressure on wages at the bottom of America's social pyramid. And Yuval Levin, editor of National Affairs and a supporter of liberalized policy, notes: \"A huge amount of American social policy is directed to reducing the number of people in our country who have low levels of skills and education, and it would be bizarre to use our immigration policy to increase that number significantly.\" Complex and consequential, immigration policy should not be made hurriedly. But neither should it be made out of a fatalistic despair about economic dynamism that better immigration policies might foster. George Will's email address is .

Internal Controls in 2013\nUpdated COSO Framework provides clear principles for determining whether controls are functioning properly in the finance function and beyond.\nOn Tuesday, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) released an updated version of its Internal Control - Integrated Framework. COSO was formed in 1985 by the AAA, AICPA, FEI, IIA, and IMA to provide thought leadership in three areas: enterprise risk management, internal controls, and fraud deterrence. The organization released its original internal controls framework in 1992. This week's update is the first revision to that document, and it represents two and a half years of work by COSO and by PwC, which authored the new framework under the direction of the COSO board.\nThe COSO Framework is designed to be applied companywide, and it can help managers maintain controls over a wide swath of treasury and finance functions. \"When people think of controls, they think of general ledgers and external financial reporting, but the Framework is intended to be applied broadly,\" says David Landsittel, chairman of COSO. \"We articulate three overall objectives that companies can apply controls to - reporting, compliance, and operations objectives - and there's overlap between them. In the treasury function, certainly there needs to be control over hedging or trading. Depending on the nature of the organization, that might be an operational control, but it might have financial reporting implications as well.\"\nAcross the three objectives, the COSO Framework presents five key components of internal controls: the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities. In the latest iteration of the Framework, the core objectives and components remain unchanged from the 1992 version, but this version adds a list of principles associated with each component. The idea is that an organization which abides by these principles can ensure that its internal controls infrastructure meets the standards of the Framework.\n\"In the updated version of the Framework, we articulate 17 principles that need to be addressed in order to conclude that the five components are present and functioning,\" Landsittel says. \"We believe that making the principles more explicit makes the document easier to apply because it's easier to see what it takes to have an effective system.\" (The principles are listed on page 2 of this article.)\nIn addition to clarifying internal control requirements by articulating these 17 principles, the revised Framework includes broadened operations and reporting objectives - for example, covering internal management reporting as well as external reporting, for both financial and nonfinancial data. It also provides an updated context that reflects the changes in the business environment over the past two decades, including changes in technology, changes in expectations around governance and compliance, and increased complexity in companies' business models created by practices such as outsourcing.\nStill, the controls remain principles-based rather than rules-based. \"We think that one size doesn't fit all, an"

The administration's lead negotiator, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, met with congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle Thursday, looking for an agreement on the hazard Congress and the White House created last year to focus their minds on deficit reduction. Perhaps the most important sticking point is over income tax rates. The outcome of the negotiations will determine how many Americans will face higher tax rates  -  and how much of a hike it will be. Obama's Proposal President Obama has proposed that top tax rates for well-off Americans rise to their levels from before the Bush-era tax cuts. But he wants to keep the Bush tax cuts for the middle class. So income tax rates for couples making less than $250,000 and individuals making less than $200,000 would remain where they are. What would that mean for you? Well, if you're among the well-off and earn more than those amounts, the money you make above those levels would be taxed at 36 percent and 39.6 percent  -  up a few points from where they are taxed now, and exactly where they were during the Clinton administration. For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, this change would boost their tax bill a lot. \"That tax increase would amount to something in the neighborhood of $120,000,\" says Donald Marron, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. The center has crunched a lot of numbers related to the tax effects of the fiscal cliff and the various proposals to avoid it. Len Burman, who used to run the center but now is a professor at Syracuse University, says allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for the well-off would put a dent in the deficit. \"Raising the tax rates to basically the pre-Bush levels for the high-income people would raise about $850 billion over 10 years,\" he says. But would that be a bulldozer-size dent or a baseball-size dent in the deficit? \"It's significant ... but we're looking at $10 trillion-plus in deficits over the next 10 years, so this is less than 10 percent of the total,\" Burman says. The president would reduce the deficit an additional 5 percentage points through his proposal to reduce the value of tax deductions for the wealthy. The Fiscal Plunge Scenario But what if policymakers can't reach an agreement and we go over this fiscal cliff? Tax rates would go up across the board. The Tax Policy Center says about 90 percent of Americans would see their tax bill increase. \"For a middle-income household, this increase would be around $2,000; for a low-income household, it would be around $400,\" says center co-director Marron. While that's not a pleasant thought, allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for everyone would cut deficits significantly, Burman says. \"We'd raise $2.2 trillion in income tax revenues over the next 10 years and $430 billion in estate tax revenues,\" he says. That would cut projected deficits by about 25 percent over the next 10 years  -  a much more sizable chunk, but still not enough to solve the deficit problem. Of course, the shock to the economy of the abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts would likely cause the economy to plunge back into recession. That's really why they call it the \"fiscal cliff.\" GOP Pushes Tax Reform Republicans say hiking rates for anyone is the wrong approach. They want to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone for one more year. That would mean a $400 billion boost to next year's projected deficit. But during the year, Republicans say, Washington could work on changes to tax policy and entitlements and try to close the budget gap for the long term. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia University's School of Business and an adviser to Mitt Romney, agrees. He says raising rates is a bad idea. \"I'd rather see us talk about tax reform,\" Hubbard says. \"That is, have the Congress say, 'OK, here's the dollars that we need to raise in revenue, now let's talk about a better tax system.' \"Copyright 2013 NPR.

        "webpage": "Editorial: Jobless benefits still a long way from passing Congress\nThe Issue: A handful of Republican senators vote for full debate on extending unemployment compensation. Our Opinion: Democrats must be willing to compromise in order to continue the $6.4 billion program.\n[+] Enlarge.\n- The Associated Press\nA job seeker holds a resume while talking with a recruiter at a career fair in King of Prussia. The Labor Department reported Thursday on the number of Americans who applied for jobless claims last week.\nDespite a vote last week in the Senate to conduct a full debate on a proposal to extend unemployment benefits that expired last month for 1.3 million people, expectations are the effort will get stalled, if not in the upper chamber then certainly in the House, and it will become a campaign issue.\nThe major stumbling block likely will be the Democrats' resistance to whatever the Republicans are demanding in return for extending the benefits, which kick in after workers exhaust the initial 26 weeks of unemployment compensation that is provided by most states.\nThose demands have ranged from a delay in the implementation of Obamacare, a proposal made by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that was rejected out of hand by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, to finding a way to pay for the $6.4 billion extension by removing something else from the federal budget.\nPaying for the extensions by removing something of equal value seems to be a reasonable idea, but the two sides will be hard-pressed to find something in the spending guide that they can agree to cut.\nReid indicated he would wait to comment until after he sees the specific proposals Senate Republicans will make.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner reiterated the demand that any extension be offset by cuts elsewhere in the budget, but he also attempted to link the effort to some of the GOP's top legislative priorities, such as approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and opening federal lands for energy exploration.\nThe Obama administration has balked on approving the pipeline despite changes that were made in an effort to protect sensitive aquifers in Nebraska. Since that state no longer objects to the conduit and unions have endorsed the project, it could provide the perfect quid pro quo for the two parties to agree and get the unemployment benefits extended.\nBut there is still that demand that some way be found to pay for the extension. That is something the GOP might want to consider dropping in an effort to keep the focus of the midterm election on Obamacare, an issue they believe could give them control of the Senate as well as the House.\nBut if demand to pay for the extension of unemployment benefits prevents the two parties from reaching an agreement, there is no doubt the Democrats would try to use that, perhaps along with immigration reform and a hike in the minimum wage, to pry the election debate away from Obamacare.\nIn fact, Sen. Mark S. Kirk, R-Ill., told The New York Times that Democrats wanted to have Republicans vote no on extending the benefits so they can bash the GOP during the campaign, a contention that Democrats didn't deny.\nOne proposal that was offered that seemed very reasonable came from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who suggested that after a year, benefits should be linked to enrollment in job-training programs.\nFew could argue the need to extend the benefits. The nationwide unemployment rate for December was 6.7 percent, still well more than what could be considered anything close to full employment, with many areas of the country stuck in double digits. But Democrats must be willing to give something up, assuming they want an extension and not a campaign issue."

Trust, credibility and faith are integral elements of financial stability. Perception is reality. It's not what is; it's what's perceived to be. Social mood and risk appetites shape the tape. These axioms should remain on our radar as we, the people, edge ahead. In late February and early March when I positioned for a sharp rally, we offered there would be ample after-the-fact affirmation once it arrived. It seemed far-fetched at the time and paradoxically, that's likely why it worked so well. Fast-forward 38% in the S&P. Performance anxiety kicked in and folks chased reward in lieu of risk management. Why? The tape was higher and as the market is the world's largest thermometer, things were \"better,\" or so goes conventional wisdom. That perspective is flawed, in my view, and sets the stage for the next phase of disappointment. While further upside is plausible should the dollar break lower, real risk remains given the cumulative imbalances in our finance based, derivative laced world. I most certainly respect the price action. If I've learned anything over the course of my career, it's that the market is never wrong and we're pawns in the greater game. I also understand that the friction between perception and reality is where profitability resides. We can debate the \"what, how and why\" until we're blue in the face but time and price are the ultimate arbiters of variant views. I offer that thought with an eye cast towards a growing chasm, with Wall Street and capitalism on one side and Washington, purportedly on behalf of Main Street, on the other. We recently witnessed the vilification of money managers who didn't let their investors-people they have a fiduciary responsibility to-fall on their swords for the \"greater good.\" Those who failed to follow the pied piper party line were hung out to dry when our president scolded dissident Chrysler bondholders, setting a dangerous precedent. It's not dissimilar to the autumn of 2001 or the spring of 2003, when one was branded unpatriotic if they weren't bullish on equities following September 11th or the invasion of Iraq. That dynamic is, in many ways, the polar opposite of what our founding fathers had in mind some 233 years ago. This isn't about sacrificial lambs in the court of public opinion as much as blurred lines between the balance of powers and freedom of speech that are the hallmarks of this great nation. The foundation of capitalism is seismically shifting and it would be myopic to pretend it doesn't or won't matter. We watched those seeds begin to sow when research reports triggered lawsuits and brought to bear our First Amendment rights. We revisited them when martial law was declared for the markets and short sales were banned in the financials.We monitored moral hazard when our government bought the cancer and sold the car crash as the bailout bonanza begun. This is a critical crossroads for the United States of America, one that has little to do with the next few percent or the color of our bottom line. It's about understanding the ramifications of our current course, respecting political risk stateside and abroad and staying true to the foundational construct of our free-market society. We've not yet passed the point of no return. We can still shift towards a legitimate meritocracy where those who proactively prepared themselves and their organizations are rewarded for their efforts and those who transgressed pay the price as debt is destroyed and markets reset. To this I would ask if not us, who and if not now, when? I, for one, would rather bear this burden rather than pass the residue of societal excess to future generations. It won't be a pleasant process but the sooner we're allowed to go through it, the quicker we'll be able to get through it.

Despite almost 74% of people worrying about being burgled many are failing to take sensible precautions to protect their technology from being pinched.\n\nMore than one in five (21%) never bother to hide valuables when leaving the house and 37% leave portable gadgets such as iPads and e-book readers easily accessible.\nThe survey by Zurich also found:\n\n\u202218% don't have any additional security measures in place, such as alarms or CCTV cameras.\n\n\u202240% admit their main security measure is to 'leave the light on' when they go out.\n\n\u2022Over the last year, 45% have spent nothing on protecting their homes, and a quarter have only spent \u00a3100 or less.\n\n\u202235% feel more at risk of burglary this time of year when the clocks go back and the evenings get darker.\nPhil Ost, home insurance expert at Zurich said:\n\"It's the increase in easily portable modern technology which appears to be pushing up the cost of theft from homes.\n\nA few years ago, burglars would steal a few big items such as televisions and Hi-Fi's. Now, it's easier to pinch a number of high-value mobile items such as laptops, iPads and e-book readers which can fit easily into a rucksack.\n\n\"Protect the mobile tech you keep at home by hiding it away when you're out. Laptops and hard drives store some of our most important data - pictures, music and documents - which might be irreplaceable if stolen.\n\n\"Returning home to find you've been burgled can be deeply traumatic. Prevent burglars from breaking in by making sure you have the best security possible, and use it - set alarms, bolt the garden gate and double lock doors.\"\nZurich has joined-up with reformed burglar Michael Fraser* to identify easy ways to protect your home from burglary:\n\n1. Always keep your gate closed. A gate left slightly ajar or open is a signal to burglars you're not particularly safety conscious and will make them think you're probably lax about other security measures.\n\n- 2. Always double lock your door. Traditionally a burglar will push the door using their foot and if it makes a little gap, they know it's not double locked and can easily be broken into.\n- 3. Don't give burglars a reason to break-in. Always ensure valuables are kept out of sight and away from windows.\n- 4. Photograph the rooms in your house. If a burglar 'trashes' your home, it can be hard to remember where items were placed and what exactly has gone missing. Photographs can also be useful when talking to your insurer about which items have been stolen.\n- 5. Don't tell burglars your house is empty. Don't use social media to advertise when you're away on holiday and avoid the temptation to update your location status while you're away.\n- 6. Don't give burglars the keys to your house, car or shed. Hide all keys in a drawer; don't leave them in view or in window locks.\n- 7. Don't give burglars a leg-up. Chain your wheelie bins together as burglars use them to get through windows and for access to upper floors.\n- 8. Shred all paperwork. Even an envelope which contains your name and address could allow burglars to clone you. This is particularly important now that many of us have detailed online profiles.\n- 9. Don't give burglars the tools to break into your home. All tools should be stored in a secure, locked shed.\n- 10. Keep luggage in the loft. Burglars will use your suitcases and bags to take your possessions from your home\n\nMichael Fraser added:\n\n\"Burglars are lazy, cowardly human beings looking for a quick and easy option, so think about that when considering which security measures you have on your house.\n\n\"Think about how hard it would be to gain access to your home if you locked yourself out. If it wouldn't take too long then your security measures aren't good enough\".\n\nif you have any concerns about the security of your property then please call A.R Locksmiths and we will help you with this.We can give you the best advice possible and install any extra security that is required.

        "webpage": "Proposed mortgage rule changes could have an impact on rural P.E.I.\n\nPaul Taylor, president and CEO of Mortgage Professionals Canada, was in Charlottetown recently advising government officials about proposed changes to mortgage rules.\n\nCHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. - Proposed mortgage rule changes could result in fewer potential homebuyers in the market and, in effect, impact rural economies by lowering the value of homes, says Paul Taylor, president and CEO of Mortgage Professionals Canada.\n\n\"At the end of the day, consumers will end up either not being able to buy the home they really want to or just being disqualified entirely from the marketplace in some instances,\" said Taylor, who was recently in Charlottetown speaking to provincial government officials, MLAs and community leaders about the proposed changes by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). Taylor also visited Fredericton, Halifax and St. John's.\n\nCurrently, a potential homeowner with less than the 20 per cent down payment needs to qualify for mortgage insurance. This involves qualifying for a mortgage at the Bank of Canada's posted five-year rate of 4.84 per cent interest. Even if a mortgage is at an actual lower interest rate of around 3.2 per cent, the mortgage can only be insured at the Bank of Canada rate.\n\nTaylor expects the Bank of Canada rate to climb above five per cent, meaning there is about a two per cent difference between the actual interest rate and the Bank of Canada rate needed to qualify for mortgage insurance.\n\nThis means that previously qualifying for a $150,000 home would now qualify you for a $120,000 home.\n\n\"That's a pretty significant jolt in terms of quality of life than the type of living arrangement you'd like,\" he said.\n\nTaylor explained the OSFI is proposing a stress test that now includes uninsured borrowers (with a 21 per cent or more down payment).\n\nThe proposed changes will lower the risk for lenders as well as provide people with more money in their budget because they qualify to borrow less money.\n\nBut the downside is that some buyers can \"afford less house.\" Also, the proposed changes will make it more difficult for a first-time buyer to qualify for a mortgage, which will reduce the supply of potential buyers for homeowners looking to sell and move into a new home. Fewer potential buyers will lower the value of existing homes for sale, he added.\n\n\"When people feel like their home values are falling, they really just do not spend money the way they used to. They don't go out for dinner (and) they don't go out for drinks on the weekend. And that hurts local businesses and hurts the economy.\"\n\nWith respect to Charlottetown and the Island, Taylor noted the past 12-18 months has been good for the housing market with an influx of immigrants and high demand for existing housing. This has led to higher prices and more housing starts.\n\n\"Because the majority of your market is not being driven by first-time buyers, you haven't really seen too much damage, at least not in Charlottetown. When you get into some of the more rural areas of the province, you may see some effects.\"\n\nTaylor said the new stress test is \"overcautious\" in a market that was performing well and has seen more requirements regarding a potential borrower's maximum debt ratio and increased down payments.\n\nHe said are looking at the \"prudence of the lending before we're considering the civic benefits of home ownership.\"\n\nOSFI declined to comment for this story. The proposed changes were released in July and are still in the consultation phase."

        "webpage": "Meet the French Socialist Who Could Save Europe Meet the French Socialist Who Could Save Europe\nMeet the French Socialist Who Could Save Europe\nOver the weekend, the citizens of France elected a Francois Hollande, a socialist, to be their president. Here in the United States, attempts to comprehend this may be futile, given national confusion over whether or not our own president is a socialist,* but there's no need to panic over this particular European specter. In fact, Hollande's election may be exactly what Europe needs. The key issue in Europe right now is hashing out the financial crisis that has already brought low governments in Greece, Spain, and Italy. A simplified version of the story is that most European countries got together under one currency, like the U.S. dollar, but didn't put the bulk of their government spending under one organ, like the U.S. Congress. Without those two tools unified, some European countries ran up more debt than they could manage and now find themselves in danger of losing access to funding for public spending while their banks teeter, drying up credit that entrepreneurs need. While these countries might benefit from breaking free of the Euro and returning to their own currencies, it's a radical step, and no one is quite sure how well it would turn out. Instead, there's been a nearly continent-wide austerity policy - attempts to freeze and cut government spending wherever possible while raising taxes - orchestrated by European heavyweights Germany and France and backed up by bailout money. Essentially, troubled countries cut spending, stable ones make sure they don't go under, and everyone stumbles to their feet together. The people in countries facing austerity measures aren't happy to see their welfare spending, pensions, and health care cut, nor their increased tax bills. Citizens of the richer countries funding the bailouts aren't happy about supporting people they see as a bunch of lazy, profligate spenders. What's worse, austerity isn't working. Most of these countries are facing recessions, which makes paying off their high debt loads more difficult: Economic growth is the only way to pay off your bills. Now Hollande is in charge in France, a social democrat replacing the more conservative Nicolas Sarkozy. Some, particularly folks who lent money to European countries, worry that Hollande, who generally opposes austerity, will blow up the shaky European consensus or upend France's role in the European union. Those people don't need to worry. Hollande is a socialist, but he's no firebrand - he's known as something of a dull figure in his native land. Hollande won't blow up Europe, but he's said he will push for European-wide policies that include measures to stimulate economies, not just balance the books in the short term - much the same way that taxpayers in New York and California help support their poorer neighbors in Alabama and West Virginia. In Europe, this kind of argument has been missing, but pairing Hollande with Germany's center-right Angela Merkel could bring much needed balance to the continent's crisis management plan. While today's approach is failing and looks likely to lead to the end of the Euro, the right expansionary policies could encourage countries to grow and pay down debt, not just suffer under its weight. *He's not.

Two of Vietnam's largest companies, Hoang Anh Gia Lai (HAGL) and the state-owned Vietnam Rubber Group (VRG) have acquired more than 200,000 hectares of land through deals with the Cambodian and Laos governments. Deutsche Bank has significant holdings in both companies, while the IFC invests in HAGL.\n\nCambodia and Laos have seen more than 3.7 million hectares of land handed over to companies since 2000, 40 per cent of which is for rubber plantations. The report explains a culture of corporate secrecy and shady connections with \u00e9lites which mean that companies like HAGL and VRG get away with breaking the rules.\n\nLand grabbing has accelerated in Cambodia over recent years, and so has the violence that surrounds it. By the end of 2012, 2.6 million hectares of land had been leased by the government, 20 per cent of which Global Witness says has been allocated to five of Cambodia's powerful tycoons.\n\nLaos has experienced a growing economy over the last decade that has attracted attention from foreign agribusiness looking to cash in on the quantity of arable land and cheap labour available. According to Global Witness, almost 20 per cent of all villages in Laos have been affected by at least one land grab. Forests are disappearing, along with journalists and activists who speak out.\n\nMegan MacInnes, who heads the Land Team at Global Witness says that HAGL and VRG are adding to the human rights threat in the region: 'Often, the first time people learn of a plantation is when the company bulldozers arrive to clear their farms,' she adds.\n\nLocal people have complained of increased food and water shortages, loss of livelihood without compensation and poor employment conditions. Indigenous communities have lost burial grounds and sacred forests. Those who protest say they face violence, intimidation and arrest. 'Rubber Barons' outlines non-payment of compensation and routine use of armed security forces to guard plantations in HAGL and VRG's operations.\n\nThe environmental impacts are also significant; the report accuses both companies of involvement in illegal forest clearance, beyond their concession boundaries.\n\n'Rubber Barons' says that HAGL and VRG's financial involvement lies behind an intricate web of shell companies, which allows them to disguise the fact that they have exceeded Cambodia's legal limit on land holdings. Global Witness is calling for HAGL and VRG to be prosecuted for their illegal activities and for their plantation concessions to be cancelled.\n\n'Until governments bring in and enforce regulations to end the culture of secrecy and impunity that is driving the global land-grabbing crisis, international banks and financial institutions will continue to turn a blind eye to the human rights abuses and deforestation they are bankrolling,' says MacInnes."

I owe a debt of appreciation to the Board's librarians, to the achivists at the New York bank, to my several assistants, mad to many at the Fed who cooperated helpfully to make this project come to completion. (1) The result has now been published in two volumes of more than 2,000 pages. Volume 1 covers the 1913-1951 period and has been in print several years (Meltzer 2003). Volume 2, published in February, is in two parts: part one (Meltzer 2010a) covers the 1951-69 period, and part two (Meltzer 2010b) chronicles the 1970-86 period. In this article, I discuss some principal findings from volume 2. The starting point is the 1951 Accord with the Treasury that permitted the long-term interest rate to rise above 2.5 percent. The closing point is the end of the Great Inflation in 1986. Volume 2 has two main themes. One is the Great Inflation. I discuss why it started, why it continued for more than 15 years, why it ended when it did, and why it has not returned, at least not yet. The second theme is the changing meaning of independence. Much of my book is about policy errors and mistaken ideas. That is what makes the book so long. I let the principals make their arguments repeatedly to make clear that they believed in their reasons for acting as they did. Repetition reinforces my interpretations. Because I will talk about mistakes, let me start by saying a bit about achievements. The United States is the world's main monetary power. The Federal Reserve presided over file transition from a local or regional system of financial institutions to the current leader of the world monetary system. It managed the transition from the gold standard through several alternatives to the present system, or non-system, of floating rates for principal currencies. It managed the transition from a monetary arrangement based on member bank borrowing and the real bills doctrine to the present system based on open market operations supposedly directed at the dual mandate. Traditional central bank secrecy proved incompatible with democratic openness, so the Federal Reserve has learned to be more open about its operations and now concerns itself with communications policy. In its 96 years, it has remained free of major scandal. And, from the 1920s on it has done pioneering research on monetary policy and has built not one, but many, dedicated mad highly qualified research staffs at the Board and several of the regional banks. After the mistakes that produced the Great Inflation, the Federal Reserve achieved the \"Great Moderation.\" From the mid-1980s to about 2005, the United States experienced a long period of stable growth, low inflation, and short, mild recessions. These years are the best in Federal Reserve history. Unfortunately, the System did not continue the policies that achieved its greatest success. On the opposite side of the ledger are major and minor mistakes, many of which were repeated. Some members recognized most and perhaps all of the main errors. The FOMC minutes record all the main criticisms that I make followed by my comment saying there was no response and no discussion. Recognition by FOMC members implies that at least some of the errors could have been prevented. Reflecting convictions held by many in Congress and in several administrations, Federal Reserve policy gave greatest attention to avoiding unemployment. It usually followed a lexicographic ordering that gave priority to employment. After most countries in western Europe restored currency convertibility for current accounts, the conflict between the goals of the Employment Act and Bretton Woods became apparent. The Federal Reserve treated the exchange rate as a secondary or tertiary consideration, mainly a problem for the Treasury. ...

The path to recovery has been launched, but will require full implementation of reforms and some additional measures to restore confidence in the financial sector, redress public finances and bring down high unemployment, according to the OECD's latest Economic Survey of Spain.\nThe report, presented today in Madrid by OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurr\u00eda and Spanish Minister of Economy and Competitiveness Luis de Guindos, recognises the wide-ranging reform process now underway. However, it points out that adverse conditions will limit the short-term impact of reforms. Indeed, the Survey projects that the Spanish economy will contract by 1.4% in 2013, before returning to a 0.5% growth rate in 2014.\n\"Spanish authorities have launched a courageous reform programme to address the root causes of today's crisis, and they should be commended,\" Mr Gurr\u00eda said during the Survey launch. \"While uncertainty in the euro area and the continuing global economic slowdown complicates Spain's path to recovery, we are sure that the country is moving in the right direction. The cost of economic reforms may be high today, but the pay-off will be a stronger Spain, better equipped to compete in the global economy.\"\nAccess the underlying data\nAmong key reforms drawing praise in the Survey are substantial budgetary consolidation measures and the reinforcement of budgetary rules, as well as broad and deep reforms of the labour market and the banking sector. The OECD Secretary-General also welcomed the approval yesterday by the European Commission of the conditions for restructuring and recapitalising Spanish banks as an important milestone.\n\"We are already seeing positive developments and results, particularly in terms of restoring competitiveness and closing imbalances with Europe,\" Mr Gurr\u00eda said. \"The cost of this consolidation may have been higher than expected, due to external conditions facing Spain, and unemployment remains unacceptably high, but there is no doubt that this process will bear fruit. Until then, every effort must be made to address the social impacts of the crisis and protect the most vulnerable,\" he added\nThe OECD identifies three priority areas for future action.\nThe financial crisis needs to be quickly addressed. Rapid, orderly resolution of non-viable banks and recapitalisation of viable banks with capital needs is key, as planned in the Memorandum of Understanding agreed with the European Union on financial sector reform.\nAction should be taken to ensure that the substantial amounts of hybrid capital and subordinate debt buffers share the burden of losses, especially when holders of these instruments are institutional investors. Reform of bankruptcy procedures would help shift resources from insolvent companies to productive use and could provide more effective relief for over-indebted households.\nConfidence in public finances must be restored. The government should aim at meeting headline deficit targets. However, if growth is far lower than expected, a higher deficit is acceptable and automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate. Newly reformed budgetary rules across all levels of government should be strictly implemented. Permanent budgetary measures needed to stabilize government debt should be spelled out.\nThe government should seek to avoid a disproportionate impact of the crisis on low-income households. Tax reform can further contribute to budgetary consolidation as well as wider environmental objectives. Further pension reform would improve long-term sustainability and improve incentives to move activity from the informal to the formal economy.\nAddressing very high unemployment will require a broad range of reforms. More could be done to reduce labour market duality, notably by ending the marked differences in dismissal compensation between permanent and temporary employees. Abolition of the legal extension of collective bargaining outcomes would offer companies greater flexibility to adapt to economic conditions.\nQuick action is needed to improve the effectiveness of placement services, strengthening training, especially for the young unemployed, and tightening search requirements for workers receiving unemployment benefits. Action should also be taken to improve access to post-compulsory education, notably vocational education, and to better match skills with firms' demands.\nFurther information on the Economic Survey of Spain is available at: .

Defenders say that the firm is only acknowledging what many other pundits have said for a long time: the US has too much debt and its fractious political system seems unable to solve it.\n\nLeading the charge of critics is Nobel prizewinning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. In a blog post he took Standard & Poor's calculations to task and mocked it and other agencies for helping to inflate the recently burst housing bubble with poorly rated securities. \"It's hard to think of anyone less qualified to pass judgment on America than the rating agencies. The people who rated subprime-backed securities are now declaring that they are the judges of fiscal policy? Really?\" Krugman fumed.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican contenders for the right to fight Obama in 2012 ignored the ratings agencies and instead blasted the president. \"America's creditworthiness just became the latest casualty in President Obama's failed record of leadership on the economy,\" said former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. \"This happened on the president's watch - and he has to deal with it,\" said conservative former senator Rick Santorum.\n\nSome experts were baffled by the potential implications of the downgrade. Washington Post columnist Dylan Matthews wrote that the downgrade could force some institutions to sell US treasury bonds as they are legally bound to maintain a certain amount of their investments at AAA, not the US's current AA+.\n\nThe downgrade could also force up interest rates, which could damage the already weak US economy. But the downgrade might not matter at all, Matthews added. The debt ceiling has been lifted, AA+ is still an excellent rating and few seriously believe the US will default anytime soon. \"The United States has never been in this situation before, so it is hard to see who is correct. There is simply no modern precedent for a US downgrade,\" Matthews wrote.\n\nAbout the only people not making much of a statement about the downgrade were the White House. Obama, who was weekending at the presidential retreat of Camp David, has not made any official pronouncement.\n\nMeanwhile, presidential spokesman Jay Carney appeared to address Standard & Poor's concerns that American politics was too divided to produce useful economic leadership in tackling the size of the nation's debts.\n\nIn a statement Carney said the path to a recent deal to raise the US's debt ceiling had been \"too long ... too divisive\" and urged all politicians to avoid a repeat of the bitter battle. \"We must do better to make clear our nation's will, capacity and commitment to work together to tackle our major fiscal and economic challenges,\" he said."

        "webpage": "Congress looks at doing away with the $1 bill WASHINGTON (AP)  -  American consumers have shown about as much appetite for the $1 coin as kids do their spinach. They may not know what's best for them either. Congressional auditors say doing away with dollar bills entirely and replacing them with dollar coins could save taxpayers some $4.4 billion over the next 30 years. Vending machine operators have long championed the use of $1 coins because they don't jam the machines, cutting down on repair costs and lost sales.But most people don't seem to like carrying them. In the past five years, the U.S. Mint has produced 2.4 billion Presidential $1 coins. Most are stored by the Federal Reserve, and production was suspended about a year ago. The latest projection from the Government Accountability Office on the potential savings from switching to dollar coins entirely comes as lawmakers begin exploring new ways for the government to save money by changing the money itself. The Mint is preparing a report for Congress showing how changes in the metal content of coins could save money. The last time the government made major metallurgical changes in U.S. coins was nearly 50 years ago when Congress directed the Mint to remove silver from dimes and quarters and to reduce its content in half dollar coins. Now, Congress is looking at new changes in response to rising prices for copper and nickel. At a House subcommittee hearing Thursday, Nov. 29 the focus was on two approaches:  - Moving to less expensive combinations of metals like steel, aluminum and zinc.  - Gradually taking dollar bills out the economy and replacing them with coins. The GAO's Lorelei St. James told the House Financial Services panel it would take several years for the benefits of switching from paper bills to dollar coins to catch up with the cost of making the change. Equipment would have to be bought or overhauled and more coins would have to be produced upfront to replace bills as they are taken out of circulation. But over the years, the savings would begin to accrue, she said, largely because a $1 coin could stay in circulation for 30 years while paper bills have to be replaced every four or five years on average. Even the $1 coin's most ardent supporters recognize that they haven't been popular. Philip Diehl, former director of the Mint, said there was a huge demand for the Sacagawea dollar coin when production began in 2001, but as time wore on, people stayed with what they knew best. \"We've never bitten the bullet to remove the $1 bill as every other Western economy has done,\" Diehl said. \"If you did, it would have the same success the Canadians have had.\" Beverly Lepine, chief operating officer of the Royal Canadian Mint, said her country loves its \"Loonie,\" the nickname for the $1 coin that includes an image of a loon on the back. The switch went over so well that the country also went to a $2 coin called the \"Toonie.\" Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., affirmed that Canadians have embraced their dollar coins. \"I don't know anyone who would go back to the $1 and $2 bills,\" he said. That sentiment was not shared by some of his fellow subcommittee members when it comes to the U.S. version. Rep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo., said men don't like carrying a bunch of coins around in their pocket or in their suits. And Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said the $1 coins have proved too hard to distinguish from quarters. \"If the people don't want it and they don't want to use it,\" she said, \"why in the world are we even talking about changing it?\" Several lawmakers were more intrigued with the idea of using different metal combinations in producing coins. Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, said a penny costs more than 2 cents to make and a nickel costs more than 11 cents to make. Moving to multiplated steel for coins would save the government nearly $200 million a year, he said. The Mint's report, which is due in mid-December, will detail the results of nearly 18 months of work exploring a variety of new metal compositions and evaluating test coins for attributes as hardness, resistance to wear, availability of raw materials and costs. Richard Peterson, the Mint's acting director, declined to give lawmakers a summary of what will be in the report, but he said \"several promising alternatives\" were found."

        "webpage": "In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy devastated much of the U.S. Northeastern coastline, including my Long Island neighborhood. In addition to the immediate destruction caused by high winds and flooding, power was out in much of the area for days. The utility crew that finally arrived on my street was from Wisconsin, one of many states that sent crews to help out.\n\nAlthough I didn't think about it at the time, and I doubt the utility companies knew, their action in sending a work crew into a state might have made them liable for tax under the particular state's nexus determination. This is one of the surprising findings in Bloomberg BNA's 17th Annual Survey of State Tax Departments, released this week.\n\nThe concept of nexus, the minimum amount of contact between a taxpayer and a state which allows the state to tax a business, is not new. It arises from two clauses in the Constitution - the Commerce Clause prohibits a state from unduly burdening interstate commerce, and the Due Process Clause requires a minimum connection between a state and the entity it wishes to tax. What is new is the increasingly aggressive stance taken by many states in asserting nexus.\n\nA Con Edison worker tries to get a pump working in Lower Manhattan the day after Hurricane Sandy.\nVictor J. Blue/Bloomberg\n\nWhile New York did not answer the questions as to whether sending in a work crew to help out with disaster relief efforts would create sales tax nexus, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, both impacted by Superstorm Sandy, answered \"yes,\" according to Lauren Colandreo, a state tax editor who oversaw the survey.\n\n\"Nineteen states said that sales tax nexus is created when a company enters a state for disaster relief assistance, such as utility companies entering a state to repair downed power lines,\" she said. \"That sounds surprising because one would think that states would want to encourage out-of-state companies to enter their states to assist in repairing public safety issues and addressing their citizens' concerns.\"\n\nOnly five states indicated that making remote sales of digital content that is downloaded by a resident in the state would create nexus for sales tax purposes.\n\nWith the continued growth of the sharing economy, the general public is becoming more comfortable utilizing services offered by companies such as Uber and Airbnb. The survey found that states are struggling to apply existing tax laws to transactions for these and other new technologies, Colandreo indicated. \"Only eight states impose sales tax collection responsibility on Uber and other car sharing companies,\" she noted. \"It's a surprising result because you would think states would go after one party as opposed to many drivers, to ease the compliance burden.\"\n\nIn response to questions related to short-term accommodations facilitated by third-party sites like Airbnb, 25 states indicated the property's owner is responsible for collecting the sales tax. Fifteen states said the third party was responsible for sales tax collection, while several states, including Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina, noted that the owner and third party are jointly liable for the collection of sales tax.\n\n\"The hot topic on corporate income tax nexus is that states are moving away from the physical presence standard, and toward a factor presence standard,\" said Colandreo.\n\nThis year, 13 states indicated their nexus standard is based on factor presence. Of these states, five indicated that they conform, in whole or in part, to the Multistate Tax Compact's model statute, Factor Presence Nexus Standard for Business Activity. Alabama and Tennessee indicated that they generally conform to the model statute, while California, Colorado and Connecticut indicated they only partially conform to the model statute.\n\nState tax nexus can change from year to year as the result of administrative change, legislation or litigation, and year-to-year changes are often left unpublished. \"One of the biggest takeaways from the survey is that there is still a growing amount of complexity in state tax law and policy,\" Colandreo said. \"Our survey provides insight into the states' positions on these issues even when there is no other guidance available.\"\n\nIn today's digital-first, ever-changing world, is your Site Builder site still able to support the types of online experiences your customers expect?

        "webpage": "commentsTwo-thirds of Dodd-Frank still not in placeBy Jennifer Liberto @CNNMoney\nJuly 21, 2012: 8:35 AM ET WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- Two years after Congress enacted sweeping reforms intended to rein in risky practices on Wall Street, only a third of the new rules are actually in force.The rest of the so-called Dodd-Frank rules are either stuck in a regulatory bog, ready-to-go but delayed, or substantially weaker than originally envisioned after pressure from financial industry lobbyists, according to data compiled by the law firm Davis Polk.\nCommentFormer FDIC chief Sheila Bair said the reforms are \"drowning in a sea of complexity.\" Regulators charged with carrying out the rules aren't doing their job in a \"muscular enough\" way, she added.Even some top bank CEOs recognize that the regulatory process has been slow after Congress punted many of the more controversial decisions to regulators.\"A lot of Dodd-Frank, as a bill, was skeletal and a lot of the very, very important details were left to the regulatory process,\" said Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs (GS, Fortune 500), which has spent $15 million lobbying since 2009. \"The regulators themselves are having problems coming to the right conclusions and filing those in.\"Top super PAC donorsWith so much on their shoulders, regulators have been meeting regularly with bank lobbyists, many of whom are experts but also have an agenda to ease or roll back parts of Dodd-Frank.A recent analysis of public records by the watchdog group the Sunlight Foundation chronicled the number of meetings between regulators and some of the nation's most powerful banks. Goldman Sachs: 181 meetings. JPMorgan Chase (JPM, Fortune 500): 175. And Morgan Stanley (MS, Fortune 500) -- 150.\"All the lobbyists come in and they want this exception or that exception, and [regulators] are accommodating that and they shouldn't,\" said Bair, who ran the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. during the financial crisis and its aftermath. \"They need to just tell these folks no.\"Indeed, securities and investment firms spent more $101 million lobbying regulators last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. That's on top of $103 million spent lobbying lawmakers and regulators in 2010.Wall Street's representatives say lobbying is not only their right but necessary to ward off unintended consequences that could squelch credit and choke the financial system.0:00\n/2:47Consumer bureau chief defends his agency\"Congress uses broad strokes. Regulators do the nitty-gritty. These are new rules of the road and the topics they're discussing are complex and inter-related,\" said Scott Talbott, a senior vice president for government affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable. \"Everyone can and should comment to the regulators on how to implement these ideas.\"To be sure, some of Dodd-Frank's signature provisions are in play. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- the first of its kind at the federal level -- is up and running, regulating corners of finance like mortgages that had gone unwatched for years. And the biggest Wall Street banks are starting to submit so-called living wills, or blueprints of the fastest way to ensure failure of big financial companies without taxpayer bailouts.But the financial industry has had time to make its mark on Dodd-Frank, which President Obama signed into law on July 21, 2010. Many rules have been delayed. New regulations requiring larger capital cushions at the big banks, which had been over-leveraged going into the financial crisis, don't start to kick in until January. The safest, thickest capital cushions won't be in place until 2019.When it comes to shining a light on derivatives, the trades that got insurer American International Group (AIG, Fortune 500) in trouble, new rules will start to kick in later this year. Thanks to financial industry lobbying, however, those rules will affect a much smaller group of companies that use derivatives than had been originally imagined.And it's anyone's guess as to when some of the even more controversial regulations will kick in. Take the proposed Volcker rule, brainchild of former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker.The rule was designed to protect the public by curtailing Wall Street banks from making big, risky trades on their own accounts. After two years, a final ban has yet to be released or enforced. Last fall, regulators released more than 300 questions it was grappling with.0:00\n/2:38Elizabeth Warren: Bank rules under attackOne of the main things holding back Dodd-Frank, critics say, is the complexity of the law and the regulations that implement it.Even the consumer bureau, an agency dedicated to making things simpler, can get mired in complexity. It took nearly 1,100 pages to officially propose a simpler mortgage disclosure form. \"The majority of the proposal text is background information,\" said consumer bureau spokeswoman Jennifer Howard. \"That we have included so much background information is part of our effort to be a responsible and transparent regulator.\" Mortgage & Savings Center"

        "webpage": "About the book About the authors Preface Features Table of Contents Supplements Home\nLecturer resources\nAbout the book Company Accounting 6th edition has been thoroughly updated to reflect the numerous and profound changes as a result of Australia adopting the International Accounting Standards. The new edition succinctly documents the recent changes to accounting standards, particularly disclosures in income statements and balance sheets, accounting for income tax and revaluation and impairment of non-current assets.\nThe text is designed to provide students with a comprehensive and practical grounding in the practice of company accounting, under the new International Standards, whilst providing essential information on why and how company accounting entries and disclosures are made. NEW TO THIS EDITION\nThe 6th edition is substantially different from previous editions:\nThere are new chapters on: property, plant and equipment, following AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment\nintangible assets, following AASB 138 Intangible Assets\nimpairment of assets, following AASB 136 Impairment of Assets.\nNew sections are included on the regulation of companies and on the impact of the definitions contained in the IASB's Framework for external and internal reporting by companies. Particular attention has been paid to the definitions of income and revenue as contained in the Framework and in AASB 118 Revenue.\nThere are revised chapters on: accounting for income tax following AASB 112 Income Taxes, using the balance sheet approach\naccounting for the acquisition of assets and entities, following AASB 3 Business Combinations\nconsolidated financial statements, following AASB 127 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.\nFour chapters are devoted to external financial reporting and have been amended to include not only the balance sheet and income statement under AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements but also the statement of changes in equity. The chapter on cash flow statements has been amended to be consistent with the application of AASB 107 Cash Flow Statements. Other accounting standards considered in detail in the area of disclosure are AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, AASB 110 Events after the Balance Sheet Date and AASB 1031 Materiality.\nThe treatment of dividends declared and paid by a company has been amended significantly to reflect the change in policy as to when such dividends become liabilities.\nChapters have been rearranged to provide a more logical flow of ideas, particularly with the inclusion of new material - for example, the chapter on liquidation is now placed at the end of the text.\nBesides the changes to content, other pedagogical changes are:\na more accessible and student-friendly writing style\nnew chapter organisation, ensuring students are not overwhelmed by the more challenging aspects of company accounting\nstructured and achievable learning objectives set out for each chapter\nnew graded end-of-chapter material enhancing the existing range and diversity of exercises and problems, with a star rating system to indicate the degree of difficulty\nend-of-chapter summaries and key terms, with a glossary at the back of the book to reinforce student learning.\nIn writing the new edition, the authors were careful to retain the strengths and hallmarks of this book:\nAttention to detail. Students are expected to learn key concepts and definitions and to use the terms in the accounting standards when considering issues and writing reports.\nPractical application of accounting standards. Students must be able to apply accounting standards. Illustrative examples are used to demonstrate practical application, and extensive problems and exercises are available for student practice.\nConceptual basis. It is not sufficient for students to learn practical examples by rote. To be able to apply accounting standards in unseen situations, students must understand the rationale behind the standards. This book emphasises the conceptual rationale behind the practice of accounting.\nDepth of analysis. Many current books and courses cover only the very simplest of practical situations, which are not representative of real-world practice. We have provided a variety of practical situations in which an accounting standard may be applied. This increases the complexity of the book, but makes the learning appropriate for future employment. By adopting a modular approach, particularly in the areas of external reporting and consolidated financial statements, the book enables teachers and students to learn progressively or selectively."

Our financial institutions were in trouble but today they are strong and resilient with hefty reserves and surplus liquidity,\" he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, in a special address to the nation, said Malaysia was neither in a recession nor a crisis as claimed recently by some opposition leaders.\n\nHe announced several proactive measures aimed at making the necessary adjustments following the challenging external developments which were beyond the government's control.\n\nMustapa said the measures announced were not hastily decided but after conducting a month-long indepth and precise study by the Ministry of Finance, Bank Negara Malaysia and the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister's Department.\n\n\"The explanation given by the prime minister took into account current changes and what's important is the government took time to study policy changes that were necessary to be made to ensure the country's financial standing remained strong and intact,\" he said.\n\nAsked if investor sentiment had been eroded by the negative perception of the opposition, Mustapa said their confidence in the economy was intact as the economic growth figures were encouraging.\n\nAs such, he said Najib's announcement was realistic in preparing the nation to face global economic challenges.\n\nOn the ongoing WEF, Mustapa said Najib would meet about 45 investors to provide them with a detailed explanation of the country's economic status and recent measures taken to ensure economic and financial resilence.\n\nApproximately 40 heads of state and government, together with 2,500 corporate leaders from 140 countries will attend the five-day forum themed, \"The New Global Context\".\n\nThe annual WEF, which also serves as a platform in promoting public-private cooperation, will look at ten specific global challenges that is affecting the economy across the globe and ways to overcome the adverse impact and risks to the local economy. - Bernama"

It was created in 2000 by Council Regulation 2666/2000. However it was only in 2001 that the programme became operative under its own regulations, as in the first period it supported projects previously funded by the PHARE and OBNOVA programmes. The programme is the main financial instrument of EU's Stabilisation and Association process (SAp). A total of \u20ac5.13 billion is secured for all CARDS actions during 2000-2006, as after that day it will be replaced by the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), which will cover both candidate and potential candidate countries.\n\nObjectives\nThe main aim of the programme as its name implies is to support reconstruction, development and stabilization. However, after an early focus on post-war and post-communist reconstruction much of the programme's attention has shifted to institution building projects. Its specified objectives are:\nreconstruction, democratic stabilisation, reconciliation and the return of refugees\ninstitutional and legislative development, including harmonisation with European Union norms and approaches, to underpin democracy and the rule of law, human rights, civil society and the media, and the operation of a free market economy\nsustainable economic and social development, including structural reform\npromotion of closer relations and regional cooperation among countries and between them, the EU and the candidate countries of central Europe.\n\nManagement of the Programme\nThe responsibility for the programme has been transferred in 2005 from the External Relations to the Enlargement Directorate General. It has a dual management system as the part of the programme covering Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia is operated by the Thessaloniki based European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) while the rest of support follows a deconcentrated system as it is managed by the Commission's delegations to Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania. The programme also has a regional component absorbing a 10% of total support, a rather innovative characteristic in comparison with past aid programmes, that underlines EU's emphasis on regional cooperation in the Western Balkans. Two major CARDS evaluations have been undertaken covering both parts of the programme namely the part under the CARDS regulation (Council Regulation 2666/2000) and the part under the EAR regulation (Council Regulation 2667/2000), which also suggested about the future of the Agency.\n\nFor each country a strategic framework is prepared in the Country Strategy Paper and Multiannual Indicative Programmes and annual action plans constitute the basis of programming. After the 2003 European Council of Thessaloniki and the approval of the \"Thessaloniki agenda\" with measures inspired from pre-accession \"European Partnerships\" were created with each country that constitute the foundation for the CARDS assistance. The programming period formally ends in 2006, but projects from the backlog of CARDS will probably continue to be funded in the new budgetary period (2007-2013) approximately until 2008.\n\nExternal links\n European Commission, CARDS web pages\n The European Agency for Reconstruction\n European Commission CARDS financial statistics\n Social Institutions Support Programme (SISP)\n\nThis article incorporates text from the CARDS page on the European Union web site.

The volume of initial public offerings rose 40% last year, with the US recording the highest IPO activity since 2008. Europe's IPO volume more than doubled last year. The biggest equity deal was a $9 billion rights issue by Barclays.\nUS issuers accounted for 34% of overall equity capital market volume in 2013, followed by Chinese firms, with 10%, and UK companies, with a 6% share. By sector, activity was led by financial issuers, followed by real estate, energy and power, and industrials.\nHenri Leveque, leader of PwC's US capital markets and accounting advisory services, says: \"Driven by increasing investor appetite for growth companies, low volatility and strong equity markets, the field of IPOs has continued to broaden across industry sectors. The environment for IPOs has remained highly accommodative, and we expect the new-issuance window to remain open as we head into 2014.\" Facebook's $3.9 billion follow-on offering in December was the largest US equity deal last year.\nLEADING UNDERWRITERS\nGoldman Sachs was the leading global equity underwriter of 2013, followed by J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi, according to Thomson Reuters.\nNeil Dhar, PwC's US capital markets leader, says investors are seeking returns in a low-yield rate environment, and the IPO market has been an attractive place to invest in the past year. \"Financial sponsors continued to pursue liquidity in their investments, with more than three times the proceeds raised by financial-sponsor-backed US IPOs in the fourth quarter of 2013 than the same period a year earlier.\"\nRenaissance Capital, a global IPO investment adviser, says the window for US IPOs remained open throughout 2013. Recent years, by contrast, had been marked by bouts of stop-and-start activity. \"Taking advantage of the calmer market, private equity and venture-capital-backed deals saw meaningful upticks in activity,\" the firm says.\nWith a growing backlog of IPOs, and economic indicators continuing to show signs of improvement, Renaissance Capital says it anticipates \"another dynamic year for the US IPO market in 2014.\"\nThe global IPO pipeline is also growing steadily, with Everything Everywhere, the largest mobile network in the UK, expected to raise $15 billion. Japanese railway and property firm Seibu Holdings plans an IPO valued at more than $12.4 billion.\nBRAZIL REMOVES ADR TAX\nBrazil's Ministry of Finance lowered the tax on shares backing the issuance of American depositary receipts to zero from 1.5%. The tax had been in place since November 2009, in an effort to boost local trading and curb the flow of investment to overseas stock exchanges.\nDeputy Finance minister Dyogo de Oliveira said removal of the tax would help to reduce the discrepancy between a company's share price in Brazil and the price of a depositary receipt abroad.\nMeanwhile, J.P. Morgan established a sponsored ADR in the over-the-counter market for Mills, one of Brazil's largest engineering services companies.\nBNY Mellon established sponsored DR programs under Regulation S for a trio of Nigerian companies. The DRs are restricted from sale in the US but may be resold overseas. The companies are: UBA Capital, a financial and investment services provider; Africa Prudential Registrars, a share registration company that once was a subsidiary of UBA; and Afriland Properties, a real estate company.\nDeutsche Bank was appointed as successor depository for the Nasdaq-listed ADR program of LM Ericsson, and for the Level 1 ADR of National Australia Bank.\nThis article appeared in issue February 2014"

For more information, send e-mail to  This file is also available in Adobe Acrobat PDF format Introduction The world economy, that collection of human activities spanning national borders, touches us all. The bankingexecutiveorganizing global financialservices and the poor agricultural worker cultivating an export crop are both strongly influenced by global economic forces beyond their control. The banking executive operates within a financial services protocol of the World Trade Organization and in financial markets that increase in importance with every passing year and yet remain stubbornly volatile in new and not always predictable ways. The agricultural worker sees her fortunes rise and fall with the world price of the export crop she produces and the remittances she receives from her son who works abroad in a country she will never visit. The value of these remittances changes with her country's exchange rate, as well as with the business cycle where her son works. The banking executive and the agricultural worker do not know one another, but both are participants in what we call the world economy. This work conceives of the world economy as the interaction among countries in four broad areas: international trade, international finance, international production, and international economic development. Some decades ago, considerations of the world economy neatly fit into only two of these four areas, namely international trade and international finance. Not today. Significant changes in the way production is taking place in the world, the emergence of new regions as active locations of this production, and conceptual and theoretical advancements in our understanding of economic growth necessitate a more inclusive view. What we conceive of as the ''world economy'' here is more than just traditional international economics. Integration among countries in the four broad areas considered here has progressed to the extent that it is appropriate to conceive of the world as having characteristics of a single global economy. Despite the importance of the modern world economy, people around the globe face a number of challenges in their attempts to understand it. Foremost among these challenges is a tendency for the relevant published works to be either too general or too specialized to suit the needs of students in economics and the broader social sciences, public policy and public affairs, international studies, and business, as well as the large and growing number of professionals working in international economic policy. Works intended for a popular audience tend to focus on broad themes and theories, often with a political point of view. Articles in academic journals often use terminology and mathematics beyond the reach of the nonspecialist. This encyclopedia is intended to bridge the gap between the general and the specialized. It explains the structure and workings of the world economy, summarizes issues and debates related to economic globalization, and provides suggestions for further reading on more than 300 topics. With a few necessary exceptions, the entries in this book eschew the broad sweep. Instead, we have chosen topics we consider essential to a real understanding of forces at play. The entries for the most part do not employ advanced mathematics or highly technical language. Their aim is to accurately educate and inform, not overwhelm. Structure and Coverage The entries fall into six major categories: concepts and principles; models and theory; institutions and agreements; policies and instruments; analysis and tools; and sectors and special issues. Our selection of topics in the last of these categories, sectors and special issues, was based on policy relevance rather than on theoretical considerations. We have not included biographical entries, but individuals who have played a significant role in the world economy are mentioned in the relevant topical entries; their names also appear in the index. The Encyclopedia is informed by the modern history of international economic relations since the introduction of the gold standard in the late 19th century. This is widely considered to be the beginning of the modern era of economic relations and, as such, offers a useful starting point. We have tried to select topics that will continue to be important -  essential concepts, perennial issues, and long-term trends - regardless of the particular future course of the world economy.

        "webpage": "Unlocking the economic potential of the Caribbean diaspora\nThere is nearly one person living abroad in the Diaspora to every person still resident within the Caribbean, making the Diaspora an untapped potential resource for economic development.\nNinety percent of Caribbean diaspora wants to engage deeper with the region, representing a significant untapped potential for economic development.\nKey barriers to increased engagement include low visibility and awareness of deal flow for local and diaspora angels, and a complex regulatory environment.\nInterventions to overcome these challenges should be designed for the Caribbean as a whole.\nThe Caribbean diaspora is a sizeable, well-educated, and affluent demographic whose large majority is interested in investing in its countries of origin. Due to the common heritage and strong connections across the region, they overwhelmingly take a regional approach to the Caribbean, rather than a nationalistic one. Supported by the right incentives and policies, diaspora members could play an even larger role in contributing to the region's development.\nThese are some of the findings of a new study, \"Diaspora Investing: The Business and Investment Interests of the Caribbean abroad\", by infoDev, a global innovation program in the World Bank. The assessment brings together knowledge and data gathered from over 850 self-identified members of the Caribbean diaspora, and sheds light on their characteristics and investment interests.\nThe Caribbean diaspora is already significantly engaged in the region, with some 70 percent being formal or informally affiliated to organizations in their home countries. Half of those surveyed send remittances and a full 85 percent give back to the Caribbean either through financial help, or other support in kind. Moreover, nine out of ten would like to be even more engaged in the future, potentially as investors. With nearly one diaspora member living in North America or Europe for every resident still in the region, this ability to engage represents a significant untapped potential.\nThere is also a growing community of angel investors among the diaspora that are already actively involved both where they live and back home. About 23 percent of respondents has already invested in a start-up company of some sort in the Caribbean region. Looking forward, investors have expressed strong interest in financing sectors with high development potential for the region, such as green energy, mobile applications, education, and agribusiness.\nBut challenges remain. The gap between real engagement and expressed interest remains significant. For instance, while 85% of diaspora members would be interested in investing in a business back home, only 13% of respondents do so today.\n\"The biggest barrier we found was visibility,\" explains Qahir Dhanani, author of the report. \"The money is out there, but there is a lack of awareness of investment opportunities, including what deals are there, what deals are high quality, and which entrepreneurs are receptive to angel investing.\"\nBureaucracy associated with making such investments, and weak legal enforcement were also highlighted as key barriers. The patchwork of regulations among different countries makes it difficult to unlock the latent demand for regionally-focused investments among the diaspora.\n\"There should be a serious effort by policymakers and multinationals to create a uniform regulatory environment,\" says Dhanani.\n\" Increased engagement and investment by the diaspora will be a boost for entrepreneurs in the region, eventually leading to new, high-skilled jobs \"Sophie Sirtaine\nWorld Bank Group Country Director for the Caribbean\nThe report provides other recommendations for interventions that are designed for the Caribbean as a whole. Chief among these is the creation of an online marketplace that connects diaspora investors with opportunities back home. Such an approach would capitalize on the geographically dispersed nature of diaspora populations, the increasing use of the Internet for social networking and investing, and the nascent but growing crowdfunding sector. This low-cost and scalable platform would provide equal access to everybody, regardless of their country of origin. Other recommendations include targeted capacity building for both entrepreneurs and angel investors, and the strengthening of existing angel investing networks. \"This report underscores the important role that the diaspora can play in the Caribbean's economic development,\" said Sophie Sirtaine, Country Director for the Caribbean in the World Bank Group. \"Increased engagement and investment by the diaspora will be a boost for entrepreneurs in the region, eventually leading to new, high-skilled jobs.\"\nThe report, which was funded by the government of Canada, was developed as part of the Entrepreneurship Program for Innovation in the Caribbean (EPIC). The seven-year program aims to contribute to increased competitiveness, growth and job creation in the Caribbean region through the development of a robust and vibrant innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem, with particular emphasis on supporting high-potential growth-oriented early-stage companies.\nRELATEDWORLD BANK\nWorld Bank: Jamaica World Bank: Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Blog: Channeling Caribbean diaspora dollars back home EXTERNAL\nReport: Diaspora Investing: The Business and Investment Interests of the Caribbean Diaspora Home: infoDev Belize Guyana Jamaica Suriname Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Latin America and Caribbean View More +"

        "webpage": "Egypt's Economic Health Needs Outside Help\nShare Tweet E-mail Comments Print By editor Originally published on Wed July 10, 2013 1:21 pm\nListen Transcript RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Egypt's political future will largely depend on its economy, and its economic future will largely depend on help from other countries. To talk more about this, we reached Mohsin Khan. He's a senior fellow at the Rafik Hariri Center on the Middle East at the Atlantic Council. He's also the former Director of the Middle East Department at the International Monetary Fund. Good morning. MOHSIN KHAN: Good morning. MONTAGNE: What are Egypt's most immediate economic needs? KHAN: Well, the most immediate economic needs is to somehow generate financial stability, to fix the public finances, because they have a wide and large and growing budget deficit. And of course they have serious external imbalances in the sense that their balance of payments is in deficit and they're running low on reserves. So they need external financing very badly and very urgently, just to stabilize the economy. MONTAGNE: Well, Egypt's neighbors are also concerned. They've been playing an important role in keeping the country afloat economically. Is it Egypt's stability that's the main concern or do the neighbors have other economic interests, here, at stake? KHAN: I think it's mainly stability, Renee. It's in nobody's interest to have an Egypt that collapses. So I think the hope was that they would be negotiating and IMF program and getting an economic plan. That doesn't seem to be happening just yet. And consequently, they have just been putting in money to be happening just yet. And consequently, they have just been putting in money to sort of keep Egypt from collapsing, and that includes Libya, even Iraq, certainly the Gulf countries. For example, we know that the United Arab Emirates has just given an Egypt $3 billion. All that money is essentially there are to keep the economy afloat. MONTAGNE: Several American politicians are threatening to cut off U.S. aid to Egypt. At $1.5 billion, and most of it military aid, how does U.S. aid compare with what countries in the region are providing? KHAN: Well, in terms of just the dollar amount it's not that big a deal. Egypt, over the course of the next year, needs something like $20 billion, Renee. And we're talking about 1.5 billion from the U.S. So it's not really a big deal from the point of view of the economy. It is a big deal from the point of view of regional interest that the United States has there, and keeping the military happy in some way. But basically this money that the United States has provided, in terms of aid, has gone to buy hardware and sophisticated weapons mostly, and almost exclusively, from the United States. Suppose its cut off, if the military still wants to buy weapons and so on, then it'll have to use Egypt's own resources. So we're going to say - when I said the country needs $20 billion - well, the country will need 21.5 billion. You know, who's going to get hurt by this? Not the Egyptian people if the aid is cut off, but largely the American contractors and suppliers, because they're going to lose those contracts. MONTAGNE: There's been a lot of talk about a pending IMF loan of more than $4 billion. Now, you used to work at the IMF. What will it take for the IMF to come through with assistance for Egypt and what will it mean for Egypt? KHAN: What it will mean for Egypt is not just that it gets the $4.8 billion in the loan from IMF, available interest rate of about one percent, but there's a lot of other money from donors - the European Union, from the World Bank, from the African Development Bank, et cetera - that is conditional on Egypt to having an IMF program. But secondly, it sends a very important signal to foreign investors in the international community that Egypt has an economic plan to stabilize the economy, to stabilize its finances, and to get the economy moving on a growth path to create jobs, et cetera. And that most importantly, this economic plan has been endorsed by the IMF and the international community. So foreign investors will start looking at Egypt differently and start putting private money into the country, as well. I suspect that it's going to take time for this to happen. Because the IMF is going to want to know does this program have the support of the major political parties in the country, i.e. not just the government, but the major political parties who might be in opposition as well. I don't see that happening very soon. MONTAGNE: Well, thank you very much for joining us. KHAN: My pleasure, thank you very much. MONTAGNE: Mohsin Khan is a senior fellow at the Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East at the Atlantic Council. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MONTAGNE: You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News.

The purchasing power of Hispanics and Asians in Texas  -  whether native born or immigrants  -  increased to $265 billion in 2012, an increase of $55 billion from 2010.\nThe study comes as the U.S. Senate is just weeks out from voting on the first comprehensive immigration-reform legislation to come before the chamber since 2007.\nThe policy center's report also says that mass deportation in the state, which has an estimated 1.6 million undocumented immigrants, would cost billions of dollars.\n\"If all unauthorized immigrants were removed from Texas, the state would lose $69.3 billion in economic activity, $30.8 billion in gross state product, and approximately 403,174 jobs, even accounting for adequate market adjustment time,\" the study says, citing analysis from the Texas-based Perryman Group.\nBut the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a nonpartisan group that advocates for increased border security and limited legal immigration, said the report doesn't include the costs to provide undocumented immigrants with health care, education and other entitlements. The data is necessary to paint a clearer picture of how illegal immigration affects the state, said Ira Mehlman, a FAIR national spokesman.\nAll people, legal or otherwise, contribute to the economy when they make a purchase or pay rent and sales tax, Mehlman said. But he added that is only one part of the equation.\n\"The question is, does the economic contribution offset the cost of having you here? That's No. 1,\" he said. \"And what impact does it have on other people's ability to contribute economically to their maximum potential? That's the reason we have immigration laws.\"\nThe most recent state examination of the give-and-take in Texas was performed in 2006 by then-Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn. That analysis said that if Texas went without the estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants living in Texas in 2005, it would have resulted in a net loss of about $17.7 billion in gross domestic product that year.\nUndocumented immigrants also produced more in-state revenue, $1.58 billion, than what they cost in state services, $1.16 billion, the 2006 report said. Local governments lost about $1.44 billion in health-care and law-enforcement costs that were not reimbursed by the state, however.\nThe office of current Comptroller Susan Combs, who announced this week that she would retire from public office when her term ends in 2015, has said there are no immediate plans to update the 2006 study.\nThe economic gains have been the focus of various pro-reform groups whose members include elected officials and business leaders. The American Action Forum recently sent a letter signed by more than 100 conservative economists to Congress urging reform and the Partnership for a New American Economy, whose members include New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro and El Paso Mayor John Cook, have spearheaded traditional and online campaigns urging elected officials to create a path to legal status or citizenship for the country's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nBut FAIR's Mehlman said groups that promote an overhaul and stress the need for a legitimate workforce fuel a battle between the \"elite and the ordinary.\"\n\"Illegal immigration amounts to a labor subsidy for them,\" he said. \"They get away with hiring people at low wages and ask everybody else to pick up the cost of education, health care all the things that they don't supply.\nThe practice leads to depressing wages and making those jobs too low-paying to attract native workers.\n\"Many of the jobs would be done by native workers at higher wages, therefore paying more in taxes and contributing more in just general economic output and purchasing power,\" he said.\nThe 68,000-person increase in the Texas' naturalized citizen population means that demographic represents about 33 percent of the state's immigrants. Naturalized citizens are also becoming more educated, with about 29 percent of the group earning at least a bachelor's degree by 2011, compared with 15 percent of noncitizens.\nTexas Stands Out on Multiple Immigration Fronts\nMisclassification Bills Likely Dead This Session\nCombs: 2006 Study Will Not Be Revisited\nGuest Column: Shifting Demographics and Texas Politics"

Long-suffering shareholders have just passed the five-year mark since the Australian sharemarket reached its all-time high. The All Ordinaries Index reached just above 6800 points on November 1, 2007; about 4500 points now, it is about 35 per cent below the high.The chief economist at AMP Capital Investors, Shane Oliver, calculates the index has produced an average annualised performance over the five years of minus 7.7 per cent. That is for share prices. Once dividends are included, the performance is minus 3.3 per cent.It is not only shareholders who are licking their wounds.The poor performance of Australian shares has set back the retirement plans of many older superannuation fund members.SuperRatings data shows the typical ''balanced'' investment option, where most people have their money, returned an average annual 0.2 per cent over the five years to September 30 this year.And the main reason for the poor performance is the high exposure to shares. About 30 per cent of the money in the typical balanced investment option is in Australian shares and 20 per cent is in international shares, though there are wide variations between superannuation funds.\nThe 55 per cent fall in share prices between November 2007 and March 2009 was the worst bear market since the 1970s, Oliver says.Over the past year, our share prices have risen by more than 10 per cent, or more than 14 per cent including dividends, with most of the gains from the middle of this year. But our shares are underperforming international shares. Despite our economy doing much better, US share prices have done so well they are close to recovering their all-time high of October 2007.Those share prices have been supported by the US's huge fiscal stimulus, low interest rates and the weak American dollar.By contrast, Australia's official cash rate of 3.25 per cent is still well above the interest rates of many other countries, delivering good returns on term deposits.The biggest drag on the recovery in Australian shares is the resources sector, as the share prices of the big miners are hit by slowing Chinese growth and lower commodity prices. Still, our sharemarket has moved higher since the middle of the year as the poor performances of the miners have been more than offset by the positive contribution of the high-yielding stocks such as Telstra and the big banks.Investors have also been buying shares of companies with sustainable earnings growth, despite their lower dividend yields, such as those in healthcare.Who knows whether the improvement in Australian shares is sustainable. Our market remains hostage to bad news from overseas and there have been plenty of false dawns since the global financial crisis. The risks are generally lower than at any time in the past five years, but plenty of things could go wrong. There are the ongoing debt woes in Europe, with Greece and Spain at the top of the worry list.There will be a change of leadership in China this month and there is the prospect of the US ''fiscal cliff'', where, if the White House and Congress fail to agree on the federal budget, automatic cuts will be made to government spending and taxes will be raised.If the fiscal cliff is triggered, it is forecast to wipe about 4 per cent from US economic growth next year, which would push the world's biggest economy into recession.But there are reasons to be hopeful. China's economy is slowing but is still expanding at an annual rate of almost 8 per cent.The resources boom, despite the current cooling, has a long way to go. For the market to lift substantially higher, there would need to be a pick-up in global economic growth and a swing to ''cyclical'' stocks, those whose fortunes are tied to economic growth. Nevertheless, even without a pick-up in global growth, shareholders can look forward to reasonable total returns.Oliver is expecting a total return from Australian shares of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent over the next 12 months.The chief investment officer at Clime Asset Management, John Abernethy, is expecting pretty much the same.''The market will most likely drift up, supported by yield,'' he says. Abernethy says the rally in yield stocks probably has a way to go yet.Term deposits, which were paying about 6 per cent two years ago, are paying about 4.5 per cent at present. Telstra and the big banks are yielding between about 6 per cent and 7 per cent, even higher after franking credits."

        "webpage": "Venture into export financing - Haruna urges banks\nThe Minister of Trade and Industry, Mr Haruna Iddrisu, has challenged commercial banks in the country to accept the risk to do export financing. \"You are not doing enough - the Ghanaian financial institutions,\" he said, adding that the banks were not bold and courageous enough to do export financing. Mr Iddrisu threw the challenge when speaking at the second in a series of breakfast meetings organised by the Graphic Communications Group Limited (GCGL) and Fidelity Bank Limited dubbed 'The Graphic Business-Fidelity Economic Dialogue' on the theme: \"Maximising value of exports to improve Ghana's trade balance\". He, however, conceded that many of the private players were too exposed and were, therefore, not friendly to attract some of the financing that was available from the government. Mr Iddrisu said Ghana needed to improve on its macroeconomics and that between 2008 and 2013 its trade deficit increased from US$5 billion to US$20 billion, which informed the launch of a National Export Strategy to double the country's exports from the current US$2.4 billion to about US$5 billion by the end of 2017. According to him, the government had revised the Export Development and Agricultural Investment Fund (EDAIF) legislation to make it friendlier in terms of expanded credit to the Ghanaian private sector. He noted that access to and the cost of credit was the bane of Ghanaian businesses, including those in the export sector. He said one of the strategies the government was using for expanded exports was to strengthen institutions such as the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA), the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA) and the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), while all those involved in standardisation had a role to play. Mr Iddrisu said the government had also set out to diversify the country's export portfolio and the direction of its exports, adding that for the first time, Ghana had established trade offices in China, Turkey, and South Africa, among other countries. He said in 2013 Ghana's exports to the ECOWAS market were slightly higher than exports to the EU market, which meant there was some hope and confidence building in terms of expanded exports. While noting that about 99 per cent of trade in Ghana was conducted with partners outside Ghana, the Trade Minister said the lack of regional integration, commitment to the free movement of goods and services and encouraging inter and intra trade within the sub-region were a disincentive to export trade. Mr Iddrisu also told the meeting that the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which was subject to ratification by Parliament and Cabinet offered a new and unique opportunity for Ghanaian exporters. \"We should take advantage of it in order that we can increase and expand exports,\" he said. He challenged Ghanaian businesses to venture into the farming of exportable products to take advantage of the government's support, whose threshold had been increased from US$3 million to US$10 million. The minister said the government had, this year alone, disbursed over US$100 million, largely to the manufacturing sector, although it expected to give more of it to export-related companies. \"Exports hold the key to the future success of our economy; they hold the key to improving the incomes of our manufacturers and farmers and improving revenue and foreign exchange,\" he said. He hinted at the establishment of a non-partisan export advisory council that would have former ministers of Trade and Industry, former chief executives of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC) and the Ghana Export Promotion Authority, the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI) and other private sector players as members to advise the Trade Minister and the government on future opportunities for expanding Ghana's exports. Mr Iddrisu further announced that ECOWAS Heads of State had decided to have a preferential trade agreement with the EU, saying that with an open market, Ghana could do better in terms of improving its foreign exchange regime. \"It is not enough for us to keep saying that Ghana remains stable, [is] an oasis of peace, political and social stability when the fundamentals of our economy are not right,\" he said.Source: graphic.com\" Previous | Next \"View CommentsNews Categories"

It came up with the rudiments of a bill for the establishment of a central bank for the country after a careful study of the economic provisions of the Hare-Hawes Cutting bill, the Philippine independence bill approved by the US Congress.\nDuring the Commonwealth period (1935-1941), the discussion about a Philippine central bank that would promote price stability and economic growth continued. The country's monetary system then was administered by the Department of Finance and the National Treasury. The Philippines was on the exchange standard using the US dollar - which was backed by 100 percent gold reserve - as the standard currency. In 1939, as required by the Tydings-McDuffie Act, the Philippine legislature passed a law establishing a central bank. As it was a monetary law, it required the approval of the United States president. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt disapproved it due to strong opposition from vested interests. A second law was passed in 1944 during the Japanese occupation, but the arrival of the Americal liberalization forces aborted its implementation.\nShortly after President Manuel Roxas assumed office in 1946, he instructed then Finance Secretary Miguel Cuaderno, Sr. to draw up a charter for a central bank. The establishment of a monetary authority became imperative a year later as a result of the findings of the Joint Philippine-American Finance Commission chaired by Mr. Cuaderno. The Commission, which studied Philippine financial, monetary and fiscal problems in 1947, recommended a shift from the dollar exchange standard to a managed currency system. A central bank was necessary to implement the proposed shift to the new system.\nForthwith, the Central Bank Council, which was created by President Manuel Roxas to prepare the charter of a proposed monetary authority, produced a draft. It was submitted to Congress in February1948. By June of the same year, the newly-proclaimed President Elpidio Quirino, who succeeded President Roxas, affixed his signature on Republic Act No. 265, the Central Bank Act of 1948.The establishment of the Central Bank of the Philippines was a definite step toward national sovereignty. Over the years, changes were introduced to make the charter more responsive to the needs of the economy. On 29 November 1972, Presidential Decree No. 72 adopted the recommendations of the Joint IMF-CB Banking Survey Commission which made a study of the Philippine banking system. The Commission proposed a program designed to ensure the system's soundness and healthy growth. Its most important recommendations were related to the objectives of the Central Bank, its policy-making structures, scope of its authority and procedures for dealing with problem financial institutions.\nSubsequent changes sought to enhance the capability of the Central Bank, in the light of a developing economy, to enforce banking laws and regulations and to respond to emerging central banking issues. Thus, in the 1973 Constitution, the National Assembly was mandated to establish an independent central monetary authority. Later, PD 1801 designated the Central Bank of the Philippines as the central monetary authority (CMA). Years later, the 1987 Constitution adopted the provisions on the CMA from the 1973 Constitution that were aimed essentially at establishing an independent monetary authority through increased capitalization and greater private sector representation in the Monetary Board.\nThe administration that followed the transition government of President Corazon C. Aquino saw the turning of another chapter in Philippine central banking. In accordance with a provision in the 1987 Constitution, President Fidel V. Ramos signed into law Republic Act No. 7653, the New Central Bank Act, on 14 June 1993. The law provides for the establishment of an independent monetary authority to be known as the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, with the maintenance of price stability explicitly stated as its primary objective. This objective was only implied in the old Central Bank charter. The law also gives the Bangko Sentral fiscal and administrative autonomy which the old Central Bank did not have. On 3 July 1993, the New Central Bank Act took effect."

        "webpage": "Print Email Font ResizeWhy you'll probably never be a billionaireBy Staff, The Associated PressPosted:\n01/27/2014 02:35:11 PM MST(Thinkstock)From the White House to the Vatican to the business elite in Davos, Switzerland, one issue keeps seizing the agenda: the growing gap between the very wealthy and everyone else.It's \"the defining challenge of our time,\" says President Barack Obama, who will spotlight the issue in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. A Gallup poll finds two-thirds of Americans are unhappy with the nation's distribution of wealth. Experts say it may be slowing the economy.Why has the issue suddenly galvanized attention? Here are questions and answers about the wealth gap  -  what it is and why it matters.Q. Has the Obama administration made progress in narrowing the wealth gap?A. No. By most measures, it's worsened in the past seven years. President Barack Obama managed last year to restore higher tax rates on incomes above $398,350. And he's pushed other steps that might narrow the gap slightly, such as a higher minimum wage. But congressional Republicans have resisted most such measures.Q. Hasn't there always been a wide gulf between the richest people and the poorest?AdvertisementA. Yes. What's new is the widening gap between the wealthiest and everyone else. Three decades ago, Americans' income tended to grow at roughly similar rates, no matter how much you made. But since roughly 1980, income has grown most for the top earners. For the poorest 20 percent of families, it's dropped.Q. So who are the top 1 percent in income?A. They're bankers, lawyers, hedge fund managers, founders of successful companies, entertainers, senior managers and others. One trend: Corporate executives, doctors, and farmers made up smaller shares of the top 1 percent in 2005 than in 1979.Q. Where do the 1 percent live? A. Investor Warren Buffett famously lives in Omaha, Neb. Les Wexner, whose fashion empire includes Victoria's Secret, is an Ohioan. But the wealthy mainly cluster around the largest cities. Of the 515 U.S. billionaires, 96 live around New York City, according to the intelligence firm Wealth-X. Los Angeles is home to 22, Chicago 21, San Francisco 20, Houston 14.Maryland has the highest concentration of millionaires with 7.7 percent of its residents having $1 million or more in financial assets. New Jersey, Connecticut, Hawaii and Alaska have the next-highest concentrations, according to a report from Phoenix Marketing International.Q. Does it matter if some people are much richer than others?A. Most economists say some inequality is needed to reward hard work, talent and innovation. But a wealth gap that's too wide is usually unhealthy. It can slow economic growth, in part because richer Americans save more of their income than do others. Pay concentrated at the top is less likely to be spent.It can also trigger reckless borrowing. Before the 2008 financial crisis, middle class households struggled to keep up their spending even as their pay stagnated. To do so, they piled up debt. The Great Depression and the Great Recession were both preceded by surging income gaps and heedless borrowing by middle class Americans.Q. Has it become harder for someone born poor to become rich?A. The evidence is mixed. Countries that have more equal income distributions, such as Sweden and other Scandinavian countries, tend to enjoy more social mobility. But a study released last week found that the United States isn't any less mobile than it was in the 1970s. A child born in the poorest 20 percent of families in 1986 had a 9 percent chance of reaching the top 20 percent as an adult, the study found  -  roughly the same odds as in 1971.Other research has shown that the United States isn't as socially mobile as once thought. In a study of 22 countries, economist Miles Corak of the University of Ottawa found that the United States ranked 15th in social mobility.Q. So why has income inequality worsened?A. There's no simple answer. Globalization has created \"superstars\" and concentrated pay among corporate executives, Wall Street traders, popular entertainers and other financial elite. At the same time, factory workers now compete with 3 billion people in China, India, eastern Europe and elsewhere who weren't working for multinational corporations 20 years ago. These trends have contributed to a \"hollowed out\" labor market, with more jobs at the higher and lower ends of the pay scale and fewer in the middle.Q. So what is the best way to shrink the wealth gap?A. Most ideas break down along political lines. Liberal economists tend to support a higher minimum wage, greater access to pre-school and college education and more spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure to help generate good-paying jobs. Most favor higher taxes on the wealthy to pay for such programs.Conservatives tend to back tax cuts, government deregulation and other steps they say will accelerate hiring and growth and raise living standards for everyone. They tend to focus on the need to advance income mobility.Read more questions and answers about the wealth gap.Print"

        "webpage": "The Minimum Wage Debate\nA student calls to my attention a recent release from Senator Hillary Clinton's office, which says \"Senator Clinton is a strong advocate of increasing the minimum wage.\" It also says \"she will introduce legislation when Congress returns to link Congressional pay increases to increases in the federal minimum wage.\"It looks like the minimum wage is shaping up to be an issue in the 2008 Presidential election.To read conventional analyses of the economics of minimum wages, click here and here. For Steven Landsburg's always provocative take on things, click here.Finally, I cannot resist offering an excerpt from my favorite  minimum wage has its greatest impact on the market for teenage labor. The equilibrium wages of teenagers are low because teenagers are among the least skilled and least experienced members of the labor force. In addition, teenagers are often willing to accept a lower wage in exchange for on\u2011the\u2011job training. (Some teenagers are willing to work as \"interns\" for no pay at all. Because internships pay nothing, however, the minimum wage does not apply to them. If it did, these jobs might not exist.) As a result, the minimum wage is more often binding for teenagers than for other members of the labor force.Many economists have studied how minimum-wage laws affect the teenage labor market. These researchers compare the changes in the minimum wage over time with the changes in teenage employment. Although there is some debate about how much the minimum wage affects employment, the typical study finds that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage depresses teenage employment between 1 and 3 percent. In interpreting this estimate, note that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage does not raise the average wage of teenagers by 10 percent. A change in the law does not directly affect those teenagers who are already paid well above the minimum, and enforcement of minimum-wage laws is not perfect. Thus, the estimated drop in employment of 1 to 3 percent is significant. In addition to altering the quantity of labor demanded, the minimum wage also alters the quantity supplied. Because the minimum wage raises the wage that teenagers can earn, it increases the number of teenagers who choose to look for jobs. Studies have found that a higher minimum wage influences which teenagers are employed. When the minimum wage rises, some teenagers who are still attending school choose to drop out and take jobs. These new dropouts displace other teenagers who had already dropped out of school and who now become unemployed.The minimum wage is a frequent topic of political debate. Advocates of the minimum wage view the policy as one way to raise the income of the working poor. They correctly point out that workers who earn the minimum wage can afford only a meager standard of living. In 2005, for instance, when the minimum wage was $5.15 per hour, two adults working 40 hours a week for every week of the year at minimum-wage jobs had a total annual income of only $21,424, which was less than half of the median family income. Many advocates of the minimum wage admit that it has some adverse effects, including unemployment, but they believe that these effects are small and that, all things considered, a higher minimum wage makes the poor better off.Opponents of the minimum wage contend that it is not the best way to combat poverty. They note that a high minimum wage causes unemployment, encourages teenagers to drop out of school, and prevents some unskilled workers from getting the on-the-job training they need. Moreover, opponents of the minimum wage point out that the minimum wage is a poorly targeted policy. Not all minimum-wage workers are heads of households trying to help their families escape poverty. In fact, fewer than a third of minimum-wage earners are in families with incomes below the poverty line. Many are teenagers from middle\u2011class homes working at part-time jobs for extra spending money.\nMoving to a Better Life\nGet Rid of the Penny!\nCathy on Personal Saving\nRajan on IMF Reform\nIntellectual Property Protection Abroad\nI am infuriatingly judicious\nThe Next Financial Mess\nU.S.-China Economic Relations\nNeuro-economics"

But in one way, business will not change because of social media, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. As the SEC figures out how the future of business compliance will incorporate online tools, it has decided that a total rewrite of its rules is not necessary because of the new role of social media. Some specific principles will stay in place. Financial Planning reports that the SEC will maintain its regulations regarding compliance, record keeping, and anti-fraud. The guidance provided for advertising and promotion  -  especially in terms of the records kept on the material post through advertising channels  -  will stay the same regarding the inclusion of entities such online social networks. Senior Counsel at the SEC's Investment Adviser Regulation Office is quoted in Financial Planning's report: \"Broadly, firms that communicate through social media must retain records of those communications covered by the record-keeping rule. It's really the content that's determinative rather than the form of communication used.\" It is no secret that marketing and advertising have experienced an overhaul since the inception of social media; Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and otter popular applications have caused the world of advertising to turn on its head. But in the legal world as well, social media is now a heavy part of legal usage. A 2013 study revealed that social media use among in-house counsel has reached an all-time high; 73 percent of respondents to a survey revealed that they use social media tools.

With a very low level of unemployment and huge foreign currency and gold reserves, many investors and traders opted to buy this currency. The Swiss franc has rallied as much as 40 percent against the U.S. dollar and 30 percent against the euro. This rally has hurt not only the tourist economy but also the exporters in chemical pharmaceuticals and watches. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has come under heavy criticism by industrialists and politicians for not doing enough to protect the economy, which was at risk of falling off a cliff into recession. A previous attempt to defend the Swiss franc wasn't successful, resulting in heavy losses to the SNB. The most recent plan by the government to create a fund of about one billion francs ($1.12 billion) to help exporters who have been hit by the strong franc was criticized by the Swiss People's Party (SVP). Under the plan, exporters would be able cover their risks on orders from private companies. This policy was perceived as an attempt to preserve jobs and Switzerland's competitiveness. Christopher Blocher, a leading figure in the right wing Swiss People's Party, was initially opposed to subsidizing industries that couldn't cope with a strong franc but suddenly changed his mind to support the Swiss franc.\nThe Swiss National Bank implemented an unconventional policy which it declared shortly after having slashed interest rates to zero. The SNB then came out with a nuclear weapon which successfully attacked international currency traders parking their money in Swiss francs. The declaration that it would unilaterally set a cap on the franc's exchange rate against the euro and wouldn't tolerate the euro trading below 1.20 franc to the euro. This resulted in an unprecedented substantial weakness in the Swiss franc - in three minutes, speculators lost between 8 percent to 9 percent of their trade. At the same time, Swiss exporters such as Nestle, Swatch, Roche, Novartis and Richemont rallied. President Barack Obama should learn from Swiss politicians that decided that when their economy is in danger of falling off the cliff they would look at unconventional ways to help their businesses and guarantee near full employment. Obama should look at ways to help American businesses and make them more competitive globally by reducing corporate taxes which are the second highest in the Western economy. Like Swiss politicians who took risky decisions and didn't only think about their re-election by declaring they would defend the franc at all costs, they maybe have inflationary risks but at least they guarantee jobs and help exporters.\nAlthough it is risky to invest in the Swiss currency, one should look at companies that will benefit from their courageous politicians that support them by having low taxes and now a weaker currency. Instead of investing in the ETF that mimics the SMI (Swiss market index) and is composed of not only industrial companies but also financials, I would look at Swatch, Roche and Novartis, Nestl\u00e9 and Richemont. All these companies will benefit from a weaker currency and from a government that understands the needs of a business to succeed in competitive global economy. \u00a9 2014 Moneynews.

States Pursuing Cash That U.S. Companies Stash Overseas\nIn lieu of action at the federal level, several states have enacted legislation targeting corporate tax havens.\nBy Mark Niquette, Bloomberg April 14, 2014\nU.S. states are trying to capture corporate income taxes lost to offshore havens, wary of companies exploiting rules that let them channel cash abroad and weary of congressional inaction.\nOregon enacted a bill for the 2014 tax year identifying 39 countries and territories as corporate shelters a decade after Montana passed the first such law. The Democrat-controlled Maine legislature gave initial approval this week to similar legislation over Republican objections that it was \"anti-business,\" and states including Minnesota and Rhode Island are considering or studying such measures.\nStates have taken the lead on issues that a paralyzed Congress can't or won't address, such as raising the minimum wage and restricting guns. Now, they're tackling international tax rules. Supporters say that besides generating additional money for public services, laws targeting tax havens help small businesses that can't avoid the levies as multinationals can.\n\"The issue at hand is one of fairness,\" Maine Representative Adam Goode, a Democrat from Bangor, said during debate April 1 on the bill he sponsored. \"It really just seemed not in balance, not smart, and not fair that we would allow multinational corporations to hide their corporate income in a place like the Cayman Islands or in Bermuda.\"\nCompanies with subsidiaries or operations in countries with lower tax rates can account for U.S. profits there, reducing the take for states. Businesses are taxed at U.S. rates on income wherever they earn it. They get credits for payments to foreign governments and don't pay domestic taxes until they repatriate the money. That gives them incentive to book profits in low-tax jurisdictions and leave it there.\nSuch profit-shifting costs the federal government between $30 billion and $90 billion a year, according to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report. The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which seeks to counteract corporate influence, puts the amount that states lose at $20 billion annually.\nStates increasingly are focusing on tax havens because the amount of income that corporations are shifting is increasing and awareness of the practice is growing, said Dan Bucks, the former Montana director of revenue and a former executive director of the Multistate Tax Commission.\n\"Corporations can use accounting games to stash income,\" Bucks said in a telephone interview.\nBig Rewards\nThe largest U.S.-based multinational companies have accumulated $1.95 trillion in profits outside the U.S. That's up $206 billion, or 11.8 percent, from a year earlier, according to securities filings from 307 corporations reviewed by Bloomberg News. Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., and International Business Machines Corp. added $37.5 billion, or 18.2 percent of the total increase, during the past year.\nCaterpillar Inc. avoided $2.4 billion in U.S. taxes over more than a decade by shifting profits from a parts business to a subsidiary in Switzerland, according to a report issued March 31 by a Senate committee. The company said it was a legal and appropriate way to eliminate expenses.\nFew of the states that have passed or are contemplating tax-haven legislation are home to a large multinational such as Microsoft, which is based in Washington, or Apple in California, IBM in New York, and Caterpillar in Illinois. Those states would stand to collect substantially more from such measures.\nCalifornia lost the most to offshore havens in 2011, an estimated $3.3 billion, the Public Interest Research Group said. That's enough to educate 257,000 schoolchildren for a year, according to the state budget.\n\"It takes courage to take on some of the largest corporations in this country,\" Maine Representative Joseph Brooks of Winterport, an independent, said during the debate on that state's bill. \"If you don't believe me, look at Congress.\"\nBusiness gro"

        "webpage": "We don't have to tell you it's important to teach your children basic money skills. The big stumbling block is how to do it. Unlike helping a kid learn to ride a bike or make a PB&J, talking about money isn't second (or even third) nature for most of us. In fact, polls show that parents feel more at ease discussing sex or drugs. Why? Many adults don't think they know enough about managing it themselves. Yet research shows that parents are the number one influence on a child's financial behavior.\n\nThat's part of the reason I wrote my latest book, Make Your Kid a Money Genius (Even If You're Not). I've worked as a financial-literacy advocate and author for 30 years, and even got to serve on President Obama's Advisory Council on Financial Capability. There I dove into all the latest research and began to conceptualize easy, down-to-earth strategies for helping kids learn the financial facts of life. Here are a few of my favorites.\n\nPay It Forward\n\nThe most important financial habit of all might be giving back, so here's a way to offer your child an incentive to be charitable - a concept he can understand as young as age 4. Start by talking your child through why we all need to give, and how even a few dollars can make a big difference to someone in need. Then announce your matching offer: For every quarter your kid saves for charity, you'll put in a quarter of your own. Research together organizations known for using small amounts of cash to do big things for a greater impact. For example, try Heifer International, a nonprofit that donates farm animals and supplies around the world. Your child can buy a flock of chicks to help support a family for just $20, for instance. Or go local: Make a donation to a nearby animal shelter, or to help pay medical costs of someone in your community who's ill.\n\nThe Butterfly Effect\n\nOf all the valuable money skills you can teach 4- and 5-year-olds, delayed gratification may be the most critical. It's the key skill adults need to exercise smart spending, saving, and investing for the long haul. For kids, there's no more magical way to develop the necessary patience than with a simple, affordable butterfly hatchery. It takes a little planning to set it up, and then you have to wait about a month for caterpillars to become chrysalides and then fluttering monarchs - an eternity to a kid this age.\n\nAlong the way, your child will have to carry out simple tasks - stocking the enclosure with fresh food, keeping the place moist, and cleaning up the frass (that's caterpillar poop to novices). To celebrate each stage of development, agree to put a dollar in a jar so your child watches her savings grow along with her future butterfly.\n\nRELATED: 3 Easy Ways to Teach Your Kids to Save Money\n\nEasy as Pie\n\nNothing motivates kids (or adults) to learn quite like dessert! This activity teaches children ages 6 and older how to draw up and execute a budget - skills that'll be valuable later in life. First, visit your local bakery and price a whole pie (apple, blueberry, peach - whatever calls out to your kid's sweet tooth). Now, the challenge: Can he bake the same treat for less? Head to the grocery store, armed with a recipe, to price each ingredient. If the total comes in under the bakery price, get cooking. If not, you'll have to comparison-shop - can he find a less expensive vanilla extract? -  until you hit on a way to do it for less.\n\nVery Interest-ing\n\nBenjamin Franklin had it half right: A penny saved is actually more than a penny earned, if you stash it in an interest-bearing account. Compounding interest is a cornerstone of personal finance: Not only does our invested money earn interest, its interest earns interest as well. Kids 7 and older will get this if you give them a concrete example -  and what's more concrete than free money? Since savings accounts these days fetch a measly 1 percent at most, demonstrate the principle with an exaggerated rate: 100 percent.\n\nStart by giving your child a penny. Each day after, pay him interest equaling the amount he already has: On day two, give him one more penny, bringing his total to two cents; on day three, give him two more. Stop on day 11, unless you're willing to part with serious cash. By then, that penny will have grown to $10.24 - all thanks to compounding interest."

Ninety Democrats and 40 Republicans signed the letter. There is no doubt that the Chinese currency is under-valued. At some point it should appreciate, not least for the benefit of the Chinese people (where close to 300 million still live in poverty). And, don't get me wrong, China's rise has cost the US jobs - perhaps as much as 2.4 million according to a new study titled Unfair China Trade Cost Local Jobs, by the Economic Policy Institute. What isn't clear is whether the U.S. would regain much of those losses. Most economic analysis put the renminbi between 10 and 20 percent undervalued. That's not huge. As Fan Gang of the People's Bank of China has recently pointed out, the U.S. needs to remember that the Chinese already allowed the renminbi to appreciate by 22 percent between 2005 and 2008 - when the Chinese had a huge trade surplus. During that time the U.S. trade deficit increased, it didn't decrease. Now, China has a much smaller surplus (it has shrunk by a third). And, there's a good chance that an appreciation now would lead to more U.S. imports from Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and elsewhere - rather than that much more U.S. production. According to Gang, appreciation could also lead to inflation in the U.S. and trigger tighter monetary policy and an even slower recovery from the crisis. The largest part of the U.S. trade deficit is with oil producing nations. Rather than getting angry about that, we fight wars to protect our ability to import ever more oil. You can't beat them. Join them. Rather than beat on the Chinese we should borrow from the China playbook. The U.S. has to own up to the fact that China has built an industrial powerhouse through research and development (now the fastest growing in the world), public-private partnership and industrialization, education, and yes a bit from an undervalued currency. They've become the biggest producer of solar power on the planet. The U.S. could do that too. According to a new report by the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts titled Green Recovery: A Programme to Create Good Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy, a green industrial policy at home is a better way to go. According to PERI, close to 17 jobs could be created in the US for every $1m in green industry outlays (as opposed to 5.5 jobs per $1m in spending for the oil and coal industries). Thus, $100bn in green recovery outlays would not only stimulate the economy, revive industry, help slash pollution, and decrease the deficit and our dependence on foreign oil, but it would also create 1.7 million jobs. Wouldn't it be better to put together a bi-partisan coalition for a low-oil import economy?"

President Obama has said that he will sign the legislation.\nKevin McCarthy, with House Republican leaders and business leaders, unveils the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act.  -  Photo by Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Corbis\n2012 AARP Bulletin survey on election issues (PDF).

That, argue the bill's proponents, including a large number of venture capitalists, will help create jobs, as well as innovative enterprises.\nObama said that the legislation represents \"exactly the kind of bipartisan action we should be taking in Washington to help our economy.\"\nCritics of the measure, who've called it everything from \"a disgrace\" (Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to \"investor rip-off legislation\" (journalist Robert Kuttner), say that it will roll back important investor protections, including some put in place in 2002 after the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals.\nThe JOBS Act will change the rules in three major ways.\n1. It will exempt companies with annual revenue of less than $1 billion from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements in connection with initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock. Under current law, companies that seek to go public are required to file detailed disclosure documents about their finances and operations with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which vets the filings before it authorizes IPOs.\n2. The law will allow small companies to raise up to $1 million a year through \"crowdfunding\"  -  the sale of small amounts of stock to many investors  -  without registering the shares for public trading with the SEC.\n3. Under current law, small companies that offer and sell stock under a provision of the Securities Act that allows them to bypass normal SEC registration are barred from general solicitation of investors. The law will free those companies to solicit investors virtually without restriction.\nThe measure has drawn criticism from many advocates for consumer protection, including AARP. In a letter to congressional leaders, Joyce Rogers, AARP's senior vice president for government affairs, noted that \"older investors ... with a lifetime of savings and investment are disproportionately represented among the victims of securities fraud.\" Without the inclusion of additional safeguards, she said, the legislation could \"open the floodgates to a repeat of the kind of penny stock and other 'boiler room' frauds that have ensnared financially unsophisticated and vulnerable investors in the past.\"\nAnd, Rogers warned, crowd-funding websites, in the worst cases, \"could become the new turbo-charged pump-and-dump boiler room operations of the Internet age.\"\nLynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant at the SEC, sounded a similar warning. \"People come to the elderly, who are the most likely to say 'I've got to have enough money to pay my bills,'\" he said. \"They'll tell them, 'This is the next Google, this is the next Facebook,' and put the hard sell on them. I've seen it happen with my own mother-in-law. People try to sell these things and make them sound wonderful and yet they aren't.\"\nTurner said that passage of the JOBS Act was all but a foregone conclusion, partly because deep-pocketed venture capitalists  -  who are generous campaign contributors  -  lined up behind it.\n\"This is a train wreck in the making, and I just don't think we're going to avoid it,\" he said. \"We're in an election year, and those people [running for reelection] will do anything for the cash they need to keep their jobs.\"\nKirk Victor is a contributing editor of National Journal.\nYou may also like: Understand the national debt."

Being middle class in the parents' generation meant a household income of roughly $33,000 to $64,000 in 1979. But their children had to earn between $54,000 and $111,000 to maintain their relative standing in society in the mid-2000s. (These figures are adjusted for inflation.)The middle class is defined as those between the 30th and 70th income percentile. Marital status and educational attainment had a great bearing on whether people were able to remain in the middle class, Pew found. Race and gender were also factors.Those who are divorced, widowed or separated are more likely to fall out of the middle class, particularly if they are women. And Americans who don't attend college are also more likely to slip.One's foothold on the middle class is more secure if you are a white man. Thirty percent of white women and 38% of black men drop out of the middle class, while only 21% of white men do.Why I still believe in the American DreamThings have only gotten worse in recent years. The Great Recession has likely made it harder for many people to remain in the middle class, experts said. Long-term unemployment has devastated the ranks of the middle class, with many people losing their homes and forced to turn to food banks and government aid after they run through their savings. It takes nearly 41 weeks, on average, for the jobless to find new work. Also, the steep decline in home values has hurt many in the middle class.Recovering from a huge drop in income is not easy, a separate Pew study found. Half of people who lost more than 25% of their income in 1994 had not recovered four years later. And a third did not regain their economic footing after 10 years. While it remains to be seen how quickly Americans will recover from the current economic downturn, Currier suspects it could take even longer.0:00 / 3:20 America's new poorYoung adults may find it particularly difficult to hold onto their parents' middle class status. That's because they are having a much harder time landing jobs, particularly well-paying positions in their field. The unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds was 14.4% in December, compared to the national 8.5% rate.This could hurt their earning potential for decades to come, which has earned them the nickname \"The Lost Generation.\"\"Entering your career in a down economy has lifelong ramifications,\" said Scott Winship, economic studies fellow at Brookings Institution.

Attest services are a unique set of services that require the competency and expertise of a qualified CPA to be performed. They are limited to licensees and CPA firms, and licensees can only perform these services through a CPA firm. This ensures attest services are performed under robust regulatory oversight by state (and sometimes federal) agencies, in addition to a peer review process. Services generally include audits, reviews of financial statements, examinations of prospective financial information, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board engagements and, in some states, compilations.\nThe AICPA and NASBA are updating the UAA language because they have identified potential public protection \"loopholes\" in the attest definition as the marketplace for attest services and the needs of clients have been changing. CPAs increasingly are requested to provide assurance on a growing list of client needs, including sustainability reports, greenhouse gases, the use of eXtensible Business Reporting Language, and reports on service organizations. However, non-CPAs operating outside of CPA firms are currently offering many of these services and issuing reports using the AICPA's Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE).\nBoth the AICPA and NASBA are concerned about the risk to the public when these non-CPAs offer these services. It is possible for the public (or other end-users of a report) to be confused or misled when relying on a report issued by a non-CPA who suggests or claims to have applied AICPA standards. There are also no assurances of quality, competency, and appropriate regulatory oversight when non-CPAs seek to use these profession standards.\nAt the start of 2014, 16 states already had a definition of attest language in their accounting statutes similar to the new public protection language. Several other states have taken early action this year, and many more have indicated that they plan to update their statutes in 2015 or 2016. On March 18, Alabama Society of CPAs-supported attest bill, S.B. 146, was signed by Governor Robert Bentley (R-AL). Jeannine Birmingham, CPA, CGMA, President & CEO of the Alabama Society of CPAs (ASCPA), applauded the signing and ASCPA members' efforts in supporting the legislation. \"With our statute amended, the public can be assured that only a technically competent, adequately regulated, licensed CPA operating in a licensed firm is performing attest functions.\" She stated, \"This was a top legislative priority for ASCPA and our members really came through when it counted.\" Other states are also seeing legislative activity. Earlier in March, the Indiana CPA Society-supported attest update bill S.B. 421 was sent to Governor Mike Pence (R-IN), and the Georgia Society of CPAs-supported revision bill H.B. 291 passed both chambers and is also awaiting gubernatorial approval. Meanwhile, a statute overhaul with the revised attest language was reported out of the U.S. Virgin Islands Rules and Judiciary Committee on March 21 and will be considered by the Senate on April 8.\nThe AICPA has indicated it is strongly committed to working with NASBA, state CPA societies and state boards, as well as individual CPAs and firms, to see these important statute updates passed in all of the remaining U.S. states and jurisdictions as soon as possible.\nFor more information on changes to the UAA's definition of attest, please contact Mat Young, Vice President, State Regulatory and Legislative Affairs at .

New data out today show even Europe's strongest core economies - Germany, France, and the Netherlands - slowing to a crawl.\nWe're on the cusp of a global recession.\nPolicy makers be warned: Austerity is the wrong medicine.\nWe all know about the weaknesses in Europe's \"periphery\" - Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy. But the drop in Europe's core is dizzying.\nGermany grew at an annualized rate of just half a percent last quarter, down from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of the year. France didn't grow at all.\nWhat's going on in Europe's core? Partly it's a loss of confidence due to debt crises in the periphery. But that's hardly all.\nEurope depends on exports - especially to Asia, India, Latin America, and the United States. But exports to China and other emerging markets have been dropping. China, worried about inflation, has pulled in the reins on its sizzling economy. Brazil has been pulling back as well.\nAnd as the United States economy sputters, exports to America have been slowing.\nBut chalk up a big part of Europe's slowdown to the politics and economics of austerity. Europe - including Britain - have turned John Maynard Keynes on his head. They've been cutting public spending just when they should be spending more to counteract slowing private spending.\nThe United States has been moving in the same bizarre direction. Cutbacks by state and local governments have all but negated the federal government's original stimulus, and no one in Washington is talking seriously about a second. The pitiful showdown over increasing the debt limit has produced the opposite: a Rube-Goldberg-like process for capping spending rather than increasing it, and a public that's being sold the Republican lie that less government spending means more jobs. Yes, governments on both sides of the Atlantic are deeply in debt. But policy makers on both sides seem to have forgotten that economic growth is the most important tonic.\nPublic debt has meaning only in relation to a nation's GDP. When more people are working, more companies are profiting, and economies are expanding, revenues pour into national treasuries.\nWhen economies stop growing or contract, the opposite occurs. Economies can fall into vicious cycles of slower growth, lower tax revenues, spending cuts, and even slower growth.\nThat's what we're seeing now.\nWhat's worse, nations are so intertwined that when every major economy is slowing the cumulative effect is larger.\nWith anemic growth in America and Europe, the Japanese economy comatose, and emerging markets (including China) pulling in their reins, the vicious cycle could become worldwide. If global demand for goods and services continues to fall behind the potential supply we'll see unemployment rise further and growth slow even more  -  especially in Europe and the U.S.\nCentral banks may try to reverse this course. Ben Bernanke and company at the Fed have committed themselves to near-zero interest rates for the next two years (not exactly a rousing endorsement of America's economic prospects in the near term). Given the sharp slowdown in Germany, the European Central Bank might now feel some pressure to lower interest rates there - or at least delay the next increase.\nBut when growth is slowing so dramatically and unemployment is already high, monetary policy can't possibly do it alone.\nWithout an expansionary fiscal policy, low interest rates have little effect. Companies won't borrow in order to expand and hire more workers unless they have reasonable certainty they'll have customers for what they produce. And consumers won't borrow money to spend on goods and services unless they're reasonably confident they'll have jobs.\nFiscal austerity is the wrong medicine at the wrong time.\nHow Austerity Is Ushering in a Global Recession"

It is based on a need for internal consistency.\nAnd I think the discipline that thinks about questions relating to the flow of capital and the distribution of income, in those ways, is the discipline that we call economics.\nBut those habits of thought are important if you want to think about the future of relations between the United States and China. Or if you want to think about how resources should be allocated to different parts of research and the life sciences. Or if you want to fight crime effectively.\nI do try to consistently bring to bear a focus on data, on thinking about incentives, on thinking about outcomes, and thinking about how systems can be modified to produce better outcomes, and thinking systematically in that way can drive better outcomes. I don't think thinking about my relationship with my children, or my thinking about the play I enjoyed a couple of weeks ago, that's not about taking an analytic perspective. That's about something--things that are very different.\nBut in the professional spheres that I've chosen, I think that being resolutely analytic is the way to get the best thinking. I'm proud of identity as Jewish, and took great pride in my children's bat mitzvahs and bar mitzvahs. But in thinking about the kinds of questions we have been discussing, the supernatural or faith do not play an important role in my thinking; though clearly in thinking about some aspects of the very important role that faith plays in other spines is something one has to very fully recognize.\nYou know, I don't know that that's something I have been called on, issues I've been interested in or involved in, to take on particularly. But I think that you have to try as best you can to understand the world, the world view of others.\nSo when I was at World Bank, perhaps the most dramatic thing I did when I was there was do a substantial body of research that made the case - that I think has stood up rather well - that sending girls to primary school was probably the highest social return investment you can make in the developing world. Well I decided the place to present that work was in Pakistan, which stood out at that time for the fact that there were only 90 living women for every 100 men, in sharp contrast to what was true in the rest of the world. But in order to make that a presentation that would connect not just with my concerns, but with my audience's concerns, with the aid of others who were far more knowledgeable than I, I reflected on some of those parts of the Koran that extol the importance of fair treatment of girls and of women. Because I thought it was important to try to see that issue not just through a kind of narrow-minded prism of what would reduce mortality rates and the like, but through the prism through which others were more likely to see it. And I think that that kind of effort to understand others is almost always availing.\nQuestion: What is the measure of a good life?

Peterson Intergenerational Fairness Tax Credit\nSOURCE: Truthout.org 2-23-09 Dean Baker: The Solution to the Budget Deficit ... The Peter G. Peterson Intergenerational Fairness Tax Credit\n[Dean Baker is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR). He is the author of \"Plunder and Blunder: The Rise and Fall of The Bubble Economy.\" He also has a blog, \"Beat the Press,\" where he discusses the media's coverage of economic issues. You can find it at the American Prospect's web site.]\nPeter Peterson is coming to get your Social Security and Medicare. Peterson was the commerce secretary in the Nixon administration. He then went on to make billions of dollars as one of the top executives at the Blackstone Group, a private equity fund. Mr. Peterson is known as one of the top beneficiaries of the fund managers' tax break, through which he personally pocketed tens of millions of dollars.\nMr. Peterson has been using his Wall Street wealth to attack these social insurance programs for decades, but he recently stepped up his efforts. Last year, he spent $1 billion to endow the Peter G. Peterson Foundation to further his efforts.\nIn politics, it's not easy to counter the impact of $1 billion. In addition to its money, the Peterson crew enjoys the support of many important news outlets, most importantly The Washington Post, which pushes his line on both its editorial and news pages.\nIn fact, The Post even went so far as to identify Peterson's foundation by its boilerplate, an organization that \"advocates for federal fiscal responsibility,\" instead of telling readers of its political leanings, the normal mode of identification for such organizations. (The Center for Economic and Policy Research was established \"to promote democratic debate on the most important economic and social issues that affect people's lives.\")\nWhile the Peterson crew may have the money and the support of the media, the rest of us can rely on logic and ridicule to counter the attack. In this spirit, we have the Peter G. Peterson Intergenerational Fairness Tax Credit. (Mr. Peterson is apparently fond of having things named after him. In addition to his new Peter G. Peterson Foundation, he also has a think tank named after him, the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics.)\nThe Peterson tax credit would essentially take the Peterson crew at their word. They claim that they are worried that huge tax burdens will leave future generations worse off than the generations that preceded them.\nThis isn't true. There is no plausible scenario, short of war or environmental disaster, that would leave future generations worse off than their parents or grandparents. But we don't have to argue with the billionaire; let's just give future generations the option to trade places with their parents or grandparents who made out so well.\nThis is where the tax credit comes in. The tax credit would allow an individual to trade her after-tax income for the after-tax income that someone born 20 or 40 years sooner would have earned at the same age. For example, if someone born in 1990 believes in 2020 that their grandparents got a better deal, they would simply check off the year 1940, and they would have their taxes adjusted so that they would have the same after-tax income of a person born in 1940, when they were also age 30.\nOf course, the young ones would end up big losers in this story. Real wages, on average, will be more than 50 percent higher in 2020 than they were in 1970. Even if tax rates were, on average, 5 percentage points higher, workers in 2020 will still have after-tax wages that are more than 40 percent higher than their counterparts in 1970.\nThis means that anyone who chose to take advantage of the intergenerational equity tax credit would end up as a big loser. That is why it can help solve the deficit problem. If people check off the tax credit, they will pay more in taxes and, therefore, increase government revenue.\nIt might be hard to convince large numbers of people to voluntarily pay more in taxes. This is where the Peterson Foundation comes in. They are spending huge amounts of money trying to convince young people that they are being ripped off by their parents and grandparents. They are even promoting front groups of young people to advance this effort.\nWith his billion dollars, Peterson could convince a huge number of gullible young people to tax advantage of the intergenerational equity tax credit. Insofar as he is successful in this effort, he can help to generate billions of dollars that can be used for items like health care, preschool education, and other pressing needs.\nSo, let's join efforts with Mr. Peterson and encourage his followers to take advantage of the Peter G. Peterson Intergenerational Fairness Tax Credit. There is a word for taking money from willfully ignorant young people who would deny their parents and grandparents the Social Security and Medicare benefits they need to survive: justice.\nentire article at Truthout.org"

Lapsed Tax Breaks Risk Corporate Profits\nCompanies and analysts speak out on frustration around unpredictability of tax rates, as Congress allows breaks to expire, only to later renew them retroactively.\nBy Richard Rubin and Ian King, Bloomberg January 21, 2014\nThe tax credit for corporate research and 54 other breaks in the U.S. tax code expired Dec. 31. They've been replaced by confusion and frustration.\nAs U.S. corporations such as Intel Corp. and General Electric Co. report earnings this month, they're warning shareholders and analysts that they can't assume Congress will reinstate lapsed breaks retroactively, though lawmakers have done just that four times in the past eight years.\nCorporations say they're unable to offer analysts and investors consistency in predicting what their tax rate will be in any given year and must explain fluctuations that can cause profit to vary by hundreds of millions of dollars.\nRon Dickel, Intel's vice president of global tax and trade, said the company is trying to dispel the commonly held belief in Congress that retroactive extensions are harmless.\n\"That's not true because it causes such mass confusion with the analysts who are trying to understand what the effective tax rate is going forward,\" he said in an interview.\nIntel's fluctuating tax rate - 27 percent projected for 2014, 23.7 percent in 2013, and 26 percent in 2012 - was driven by the absence or presence of the research credit, which is worth 1.5 percentage points on the rate, or about $189 million.\nThe accounting difficulties are one of the first consequences of congressional inaction on expiring tax provisions. The lapse-and-revive dynamic has become a consistent pattern in Congress, one that lawmakers grasp and haven't been able to reverse.\n\"Unfortunately, I think, it's become a way of life, tax life, and not in a good way,\" said Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\nCompanies have been lobbying Congress for years to make many of the breaks permanent, forming multi-industry coalitions that haven't succeeded.\nFor Intel, which is struggling to increase sales in a personal-computer market estimated to decline for a third consecutive year, the lapse of the tax credit compounds a profit squeeze.\n\"The tax rate is going up because of the R&D credit, which is not within their control,\" said Mike Shinnick, a fund manager at Salt Lake City-based Wasatch Advisors Inc., whose firm owns Intel shares. \"There's quite a headwind there. It's not their fault.\"\nCapital Markets Not Working Well\nCompanies with expired research credits are more likely to have inaccurate earnings forecasts, said Jeff Hoopes, an Ohio State University professor who has studied how markets react to the credit's lapse.\n\"Capital markets are not working as well when these credits are expired,\" he said. \"Basically, people see these earnings, they don't understand them as well, and that translates into higher trading costs.\"\nUnder U.S. accounting rules, once a tax break expires, companies must assume it's gone. If it's later reinstated, companies receive a one-time boost to earnings.\n\"It is definitely one of those sore spots for public companies that continually have to fluctuate their reporting,\" said Jeff Malo, a partner at WTP Advisors, a tax consulting firm based in White Plains, New York.\nU.S. companies last encountered this situation in January 2013, when Congress passed legislation retroactively extending the breaks for 2012 and prospectively for 2013.\nThat meant companies' fourth-quarter earnings for 2012 included no benefit from the breaks and first-quarter earnings for 2013 included five quarters of the breaks. Barring quick congressional action, first-quarter earnings for 2014 will include no benefits, making year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter comparisons of earnings and tax rates difficult.\n\"It puts the burden on management to have to explain to the investors and the analysts what's going on,\" said Angela Evans, Americas leader for accounting and risk advisory services at Ernst & Young LLP."

        "webpage": "Estate tax elimination could cost heirs\nBy Kay Bell \u2022 Bankrate.com\nThey may be surprised at the total value of the assets they inherit. If their parents were diligent savers and held onto to the houses they bought when the children were young, the appreciation can be quite impressive. It might not put them into the same league as Bill Gates or Warren Buffett, but it's not an inconsequential sum.These heirs -- let's call them the \"slightly wealthy\" -- might also be surprised by the tax trouble they encounter when they try to sell some of their new wealth, since they will be facing the stricter stepped-up-basis rules.And they undoubtedly will be shocked to discover that, while the estate tax and inherited property basis are causing them unforeseen IRS issues, individuals who inherit substantially larger amounts in 2010 will be reaping greater rewards from the estate tax repeal.The new wealth gapThe window of wealth that's likely to produce the biggest estate headaches, according to the analysis from the minority staff at Ways and Means Committee, is $1.3 million to $5 million in inherited property.To see how the new, slightly wealthy will be hurt if they inherit in the year the estate tax is repealed, you have to look at current tax laws governing estates and capital gains.When you sell property, to determine any potential tax, you must figure your gain by subtracting what the asset was worth initially, known as its basis, from the sales price you get. For example, if you paid $10,000 for a stock and then sold it for $25,000, you would owe tax on the $15,000 gain. At the typical 15-percent, long-term capital gains rate, that's $2,250.In any year before 2010, recipients of inherited property get a step-up in basis no matter how much it's worth. \"Right now this year, if a person dies with $2 million worth of stock that went up 10 times in value, it would be completely exempt and the heir could turn around and sell it without any tax because of step-up basis,\" says William Massey, senior tax analyst at RIA, a Thomson business and provider of tax information and software to tax professionals. , the step-up basis rule means you don't have to pay for your parent's investing acumen that grew $200,000 into $2 million. That one provision saves you from a tax bill of $270,000 on $1.8 million in profit.Family home could mean inherited tax costsThe greater the appreciation of an inherited asset, the more valuable the step-up option becomes. And nowhere, especially in recent years, has appreciation been greater than in real estate.In many cases, an estate's largest asset is the family home. The children who are bequeathed the house often decide to sell the property so they can have cash to use for other needs, such as a child's educational costs. But if the home has skyrocketed in value over the many years their late parents lived there, then the $1.3 million cap applied in 2010 could mean they'll face a sky-high tax bill on its sale proceeds.\nConnect with us Compare Rates"

In a recent survey, more British entrepreneurs said they would be prepared to set up a business than those in the US, India, Japan and China.\nThe results of the bi-annual Global Indicator Survey released today found that 84% of business owners in the UK would be prepared to start a new business, compared to just 59% in India, 68% in Japan, 79% in China, 83% in the USA, and a global average of 80%.\nThis confidence is in marked contrast to the previous survey, which is carried out on behalf of the global Entrepreneurs' Organization (EO), in which just 33% said they would set up a business. And is despite just 21% of those questioned in the UK believing its economy would improve in the next six months.\nThe Entrepreneurs' Organization hosted a round-table discussion entitled To Hell With the Recession to coincide with the release of the survey. A panel of successful business owners and mentors shared how tough times can be a recipe for success and how to expand your business in tough times.\nThe panel included serial entrepreneur and angel investor Hugh Chappell, plus EO UK's entrepreneur of the year James Layfield, founder of the networking and business centres, Central Working \n\"In our clubs in London, we're seeing a real determination to succeed and to do it in a smart way,\" said James Layfield. \"Hard times mean you have to think carefully about how you spend your money and you don't have to start big: start smart is what we're seeing a lot.\"\nAngel investor Hugh Chappell added: \"Now is a great time to start a business. There are opportunities to transform the way we do business in so many sectors and technology is going to be the driver of that change.\"\nThe Global Entrepreneur Indicator surveys members of the Entrepreneurs' Organization worldwide to predict trends in areas such as job creation, profits and debt loads, economic forecasting and the overall business environment.\nOverall, it found that 74% of UK businesses expected both their profits and revenue to rise in the next six months, 63% experienced a rise in revenue to rise in the past six months, and 53% had seen a rise in profits over the same period.\nThe Global Entrepreneur Indicator is presented by the Entrepreneurs' Organization (EO) and Standard Chartered Bank. It is a bi-annual survey of the membership of the Entrepreneurs' Organization, a membership-based non-profit with more than 8,000 entrepreneurs in 35 countries.\nEach EO member has successfully founded a business with over US$1 million in revenue.\nIn the UK, EO has about 50 members with average annual revenue of GBP \u00a38.8M. Their businesses employ on average 105 people and represent total member revenue of GBP \u00a3396M in the UK.\nFounded in 1987 by a group of young entrepreneurs, EO enables entrepreneurs to learn and grow from each other, leading to greater business success and an enriched personal life.

        "webpage": "Our Future Now In Greece Part 832: A Painless Today Leads To A Depression Tomorrow\n\nPeople should be riveted to what's going on in Greece because in many respects, that's just America a little further down the path we're trodding as we speak. Incidentally, it's not going so well.\n\nGreece is expecting to agree the terms of European leaders for a rescue package this evening as the country seeks to avoid a default on its international debts. But Greeks fear that the cuts, imposed on them in return for a \u20ac130bn bailout, is sending the country spiralling into a catastrophic depression.\n\n...The mood in Athens is a mixture of fatalism and gloom. Dmitris Kakomitas, a pensioner, said \"My pension has fallen from \u20ac600 a month to \u20ac300. If I didn't own my own house I'd have difficulty surviving.\" He was standing across the street from three red fire engines that were keeping watch on the smouldering wreckage of a 19th century block of shops burned out by protesters last Sunday. He said he didn't agree with what had happened, suspected criminals were involved, but added that \"it wouldn't be difficult to find an angry pensioner willing to throw a petrol bottle through a window of one of those shops.\"\n\nOthers, mostly pensioners, standing around Mr Kakomitas expressed resentment that the wealthy kept their money abroad while poorer Greeks were having to bear the brunt of the cuts. \"When the rich do come back to Greece, they will be able to buy our property for a piece of bread,\" said Leon Dourmais, another pensioner. Others blamed an over-large and corrupt public sector for the crisis. \"What can you expect when every politician appoints five people from his own family?\" asked Costas, a retired engineer.\n\nScepticism about another round of austerity measures and a conviction that it is not going to do much good prevails among experts as well as in the streets. The minimum wage is to be reduced by 20 per cent as part of the new terms imposed by the so-called Troika (the EU, European Central Bank and IMF). \"Their idea is that this is going to help employment, but it won't,\" says Aggelos Tsakanikas, the head of research at the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research in Athens. He says that only 10 per cent Greeks are paid the minimum wage and these are \"still paid more than the Bulgarians or the Chinese.\" A reduced minimum wage will not make Greece more competitive.\n\nEqually, increasing taxation deepens the depression and does not raise more money for the state because the size of the economy is rapidly shrinking. Greece is entering its fifth year of recession. Dr Tsakanikas says that something should be done to lift public morale so \"people can see that something works.\" He says that there are five main road projects that are almost complete but have been abandoned. The same is true of seven metro stations in Athens that could be opened quite soon. The problem is that the crisis has now gone on so long that the state is paralysed and even functional parts of the economy are seizing up. \"Even healthy firms can't get credit from the banks,\" says Dr Tsakanikas. One of the few positive initiatives the government has taken is to open up the Parthenon to foreign film companies.\n\nWhen a nation (or even a person) makes every decision based on what brings the most short term pleasure and the least short term pain, eventually it gets to a place where there are no more good short or even medium term solutions; there's just pain for a long, long time. That's where Greece is right now. No matter what it does, Greece will have to face a lot of pain for a long, long time. Guess what? We're making the same mistakes. Politicians don't want to be called \"mean,\" they don't want to tell anybody \"no,\" they want to maximize what they can give people today, even if it means everyone has a lot less tomorrow. We know where that leads.\n\nIt's called Greece and the time to do something about it is now, not 10 years in the future, because by then, it may literally be too late."

        "webpage": "Europe's Deal: So Who Wins?\nRobert Kuttner December 7, 2011 The proposed solution to Europe's debt crisis may save the euro, but it does little to regulate the financial industry.\nThe grand bargain between Germany, France, and the European Central Bank (ECB) is being hailed as a diplomatic breakthrough that will save the euro and the European Union (EU).\nThe essence of the deal is this: EU nations commit to an enforceable austerity program, which is ad hoc for now but will eventually become a formal part of the EU treaty. It will take the shape of tight limits on budget deficits, with penalties. That, in turn, gives the ECB the fig leaf it needs to heavily support purchases of bonds from countries like Italy, whose debt has come under speculative attack. All of this reassures markets, and the cost of borrowing comes down. In turn, bank holdings of sovereign bonds retain their value.\nTo make this deal possible, Germany has backed off its absolute opposition to supporting weaker economies and using the ECB to tacitly support sovereign debt. And France has agreed to give up some of its cherished fiscal sovereignty to the EU.\nIsn't this wonderful? No, it's terrible.\nWhen we look through a different lens, a lens of political economy, we see what's actually occurring.\nFirst, the real European economy is condemned to many years of austerity. That, in turn, means prolonged high unemployment, further weakening the bargaining power of wage earners vis-\u00e0-vis corporate capital. Europe's economic elites also get new leverage to shrink Europe's welfare state. Notably missing from the deal is any improvement in the regulation of finance, whose abuses caused the crisis in the first place.\nIn fact, if all this sounds vaguely familiar, it is exactly the grand bargain that has been promoted for two decades by the likes of Peter G. Peterson, Robert Rubin, the members of the Bowles-Simpson Committee, and kindred millionaires who want an enforceable hammer to compel a balanced budget and shrink social spending. The only difference is that on the other side of the Atlantic, the euro crisis gave elites the leverage to pull off this deal.\nIn the U.S., miraculously, we have dodged this bullet mainly because Republicans have refused to include taxes in the deal. Many Democrats, until lately, have been all too eager to give away the store and sacrifice broadly cherished programs like Social Security and Medicare that have nothing to do with the current financial or fiscal crisis.\nLooking forward, I can think of two moderately hopeful signs. First, austerity will not be popular, least of all after three years of high unemployment and belt-tightening. As European nations grapple with how to shrink their deficits, there will be renewed pressure to tax bankers and increase taxes and tax enforcement on the rich in order to avoid shrinking European social outlays that are broadly popular and more generous than ours. To use an awkward phrase, there will be increased consciousness of class.\nIt is also possible that the backlash against this deal will help the progressive opposition come to power in both France and Germany. Just as intensive government-to-government discussions have taken place in Paris and Berlin, the French Socialists and the German Social Democratic and Green Party leadership have been in discussions about a common program.\nThe next French presidential election is in late April 2012. The German federal elections must be held by the fall of 2013. A common left program would include substantial public investment to increase growth and reduce unemployment, as well as serious regulation of the financial sector. On the other hand, new center-left governments, under pressure to \"reassure markets,\" could settle for token public spending and token bank regulation, which would change little.\nIn the meantime, financial elites have won a major victory. The pity is that the press has largely interpreted this in terms of saving the euro and calming capital markets rather than a question of who really benefits and who suffers. A very different strategy could have saved the euro, spared ordinary Europeans the pain of such extensive austerity, and reined in banks to prevent the next crisis from recurring. But that sort of policy change will first require a massive shift in political power.\n\"Never Trump!\" Is Becoming \"Go Trump!\" in the Blink of an EyePaul Waldman The Republican Party is unifying, with astonishing speed.\nSpare a Thought For Those Condemned to Defend Donald TrumpPaul Waldman It's a soul-crushing job, but someone has to do it.\nWill Libertarians Help Elect Hillary Clinton?Robert Kuttner This year's Libertarian ticket could give traditional Republicans a way to spurn Trump without supporting Hillary.\nRobert Kuttner is co-founder and co-editor of The American Prospect, and professor at Brandeis University's Heller School.

        "webpage": "sponsored by U.S. Jobs Market Dropouts Increasingly Likely To Stay Out\nSend a link to a friend Share [March 27, 2014] By Lucia Mutikani\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) \ufffd A growing number of Americans quitting the labor force are likely gone for good, offering a cautionary note to the Federal Reserve as it tries to gauge how tight the jobs market is and how quickly to raise interest rates.\nFor a long time, data suggested a significant portion of the decrease in labor force participation was because many job seekers had grown frustrated with their search and had given up looking. If the job market tightened enough, the thinking went, these Americans would be lured back to hunt for work again.\nBut a different picture is now emerging. Data shows participation in the past few years has fallen mainly because Americans have retired or signed up for disability benefits.\n\"The data suggest that the recent exits from the labor force have been more voluntary in nature than was the case in 2009, when the economy was weak and job prospects were dire,\" said Omair Sharif, senior economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.\nAccording to economists who have analyzed Labor Department data, 6.6 million people exited the workforce from 2010 and 2013. About 61 percent of these dropouts were retirees, more than double the previous three years' share. People dropping out because of disability accounted for 28 percent, also up significantly from 2007-2010. Of those remaining, 7 percent were heading to school, while the other 4 percent left for other reasons.\nIn contrast, between 2007 and 2010, retirees made up a quarter of the six million people who left the labor force, while 18 percent were classified as disabled. About 57 percent were either in school or otherwise on the sidelines.\n\"This suggests the current drop in the labor force is more structural in nature,\" said Sharif.\nIf so, there is less hope of luring people back to hunt for work as the jobs market tightens, as many Fed officials believed would be the case. And the U.S. central bank, which has held benchmark rates near zero since December 2008, will likely need to push them up sooner than they would have otherwise.\n\"It is not clear whether the overall participation rate will increase anytime soon, given that the underlying downward trend due to retirements is likely to continue,\" said Shigeru Fujita, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nLESS LABOR MARKET SLACK\nSome Fed policymakers, such as San Francisco Fed President John Williams, are starting to acknowledge that structural factors are playing a big role in the labor force's decline.\nIn a speech last month, Williams said the slack in the labor market could be \"much less than assumed,\" cautioning that inflation could rise more quickly than currently anticipated.\nThere are people who are not in the labor force who say they want a job and who could potentially be drawn back in.\nLast year that figure stood about 700,000 higher than it would in a normal market, according to the Labor Department's survey of households. But if employment increased by about 115,000 jobs per month, as the survey found it did last year, they could easily be absorbed in about six months.\nThe disappearing slack is underscored by a sharp decline in the ranks of the short-term unemployed.These workers, whose skills are still sharp, are viewed as the most desirable by employers, economists say. Further, they appear to hunt for work more aggressively, according to a study released last week by former White House economist Alan Krueger.\nIn contrast, long-term unemployed can see their skills erode and lose contact with people who could help them find a job.\nBecause employers find them less desirable, their presence in the labor market may not do much to keep wages down.\nThe unemployment rate for people out of work for six months or less was at 4.2 percent in February, well below its 5.2 percent post-recession average. The number of short-term unemployed workers is now at about the same level as in 2004.\nAs for the long-term jobless, their ranks are still more than double their 2004 level.\nSome economists say the dwindling pool of attractive workers may already be leading employers to bid wages up. Average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers notched their biggest gain in four years in February, even as some broader measures showed little acceleration. \"With the short-term unemployment rate already back to its pre-crisis level, any further declines will put upward pressure on wages and ultimately inflation,\" said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.\n\"For the Fed, the problem is we are still having a fed funds rate which is zero. I think the Fed will start to change its tone, most likely in the second half of this year.\"\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; editing by Tim Ahmann and James Dalgleish)"

That's 19% of the population, only a slight drop from the 21.5% of the population that was married back in 1980, according to calculations from U.S. Census Bureau figures . But marriages do come and go, and Americans can expect different financial challenges whether they are married, single, divorced, living with a domestic partner or widowed. So says the MetLife Mature Market Institute in its study Planning Tips: Focus on Family Types and Financial Well-Being . More Headlines The Psychology Behind Why We Love Black Friday\nIn it, the Institute says that the so-called \"traditional family\" is losing ground, with alternative forms of family taking their place: The American family is changing. In fact, household makeup in general is changing -- today, the percentage of people living alone is at an all-time high, now representing the second-largest American household type after married couples. The \"traditional family\" of husband, wife and children, all from a first marriage, is a smaller percentage than ever before. For the first time since Census data collection on families began in 1940, fewer than half of all households (48%) are husband-wife households (first and second marriages). Other types of households, such as same-sex couples, opposite-sex nonmarried couples and single parents with children have increased in percentages.\nThere is no cookie-cutter approach to financial planning across disparate family groups, MetLife (MET) says. What one family headed by a single mother faces is significantly different than what a husband-wife household faces. To that end, MetLife uses the study to offer specific advice to different family groups to help cope with varying family financial issues. \"The economy has been difficult for almost everyone, but different family types have different concerns and there are individualized ways to handle them,\" notes Sandra Timmermann, director of the institute. \"Singles should be particularly disciplined about saving and planning for the simple reason that they don't have the same safety net. Couples with children have to consider the expenses of raising them, subsidizing higher education costs and perhaps, assistance later on. Divorced individuals and those in second marriages have still more financial considerations.\" Here, straight from the MetLife report, are specific tips on how different families can improve their financial standing and lay the groundwork for a secure, comfortable retirement. (Some tips not included below in all groups, such as creating a will, estimating your Social Security income or having long-term health care insurance, are considered by MetLife to be universal and should be undertaken no matter what the state of your family.) Couples in a first marriage: Save using a combination of financial products to create guaranteed lifetime income for both spouses. Communicate openly about financial expectations and differences. Set goals and spending budgets for pre- and post-retirement spending. Recognize the impact of supporting others when planning for retirement. 12"

        "webpage": "The Next Chapters in the Republican War on Math: Tax Cuts and Austerity\nHeather Boushey Nov 18 2012, 12:10 PM ET\nGOP partisans got their forecasts all wrong in the run-up to the election. Now they're showing their innumeracy in the policy arena, too.\nOn election night, Republican strategist and Fox News contributor Karl Rove was unwilling to believe that President Obama had won Ohio, arguing with anchor Megyn Kelly that Ohio was too close to call. Eventually, Kelly asked Rove if his calculations were \"just math you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better or is this real?\"\nThis televised moment on Election Day was one small victory for statistics. Another was that FiveThirtyEight blogger Nate Silver accurately predicted the election outcome, right down to the number of electoral votes, using a model that aggregates local and national polls. These victories for math come on the heels of an election season where Mitt Romney repeatedly and willfully worked to convince the public that his tax plan would both deliver tax cuts and reduce the deficit, which was about as true as saying that two plus two equals five. But the fact that Romney lost the election does not mean that the war on math is over. While election outcomes lay bare whose hopes got in the way of their math, on a host of other issues, understanding math-denial requires more digging.\nThere are two math fallacies affecting the current economic debate. First, Republicans continue to argue that tax cuts for the wealthy are key to growing the economy, despite solid evidence to the contrary. This argument is their primary objection to allowing President George W. Bush's tax cuts on the wealthy expire at the end of the year.\nThe facts fly in the face of their argument. We know what happened in the 2000s after the Bush tax cuts: Despite the supposedly job-creating tax breaks, our economy experienced its worst record for growth in investment, employment, and incomes in half a century, an outcome devastating to our middle class.\nYet Republican leaders are working to make sure that the math fits their version of reality, rather than actual reality. As the New York Times has reported, the Congressional Research Service, a non-partisan arm of Congress, was forced by Republican leaders in the Senate to withdraw an economic report showing \"no correlation between top tax rates and economic growth.\"\nGetting the math right about the effects of tax cuts on our economy is a priority given that the national conversation has now turned to whether these tax cuts should be extended. If Nate Silver was an economist, he would aggregate all the studies that show that more tax cuts for the wealthy will not grow the middle class. Fortunately, others have looked at the data and found just that.\nA second example of math denialism is the notion that sharp cuts in spending to eliminate a budget deficit when an economy hasn't fully recovered from a deep recession will lead to robust economic growth and job creation. Both economic theory and recent experience in countries that have gone down the austerity path show that this perspective is willfully in denial of empirical reality. Countries that have been implementing austerity packages are now teetering toward, if not already in, recession. The United Kingdom, for example, has pared back spending, but as it have done so, the rate of growth and job creation have both stalled. In fact, newly released forecasts from the International Monetary Fund show economic-growth prospects being revised down for Great Britain, as well as for most other European countries that have implemented aggressive austerity regimes, including Germany and France. According to the IMF's analysis, fiscal contraction now poses one of the top risks not just to the U.S. economy, but also to the overall world economic recovery.\nEven as Republicans struggle with math in election forecasts or economic policy, they are also failing to grapple with science. GOP leaders also continue to argue that evidence of global warming is really a case of \"manipulated data.\" But the empirical evidence is overwhelming that climate change is not only real, it is having serious economic and social impacts. The economic impacts are proving to be quite large: The cost of extreme weather events, which are becoming more common as the earth warms, is estimated to be $14.5 billion -- and that's before the cost of Hurricane Sandy.\nKelly hit the mark when she asked what kind of math Rove was doing. The beauty of math is that two plus two always equals four, no matter your political leanings. We should all start asking whether someone's math is something they do to make themselves feel better or whether it's a calculation that others can replicate.\nHeather Boushey is the executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.\nPredictions for the Global Economy"

        "webpage": "Congress looks at doing away with the $1 bill\nThis undated file photo provided by the U.S. Mint shows the President John Adams presidential $1 coin. / AP by USA TODAYby USA TODAY Filed Under\nWASHINGTON (AP) - American consumers have shown about as much appetite for the $1 coin as kids do their spinach. They may not know what's best for them either. Congressional auditors say doing away with dollar bills entirely and replacing them with dollar coins could save taxpayers some $4.4 billion over the next 30 years.\nVending machine operators have long championed the use of $1 coins because they don't jam the machines, cutting down on repair costs and lost sales. But most people don't seem to like carrying them. In the past five years, the U.S. Mint has produced 2.4 billion Presidential $1 coins. Most are stored by the Federal Reserve, and production was suspended about a year ago.\nThe latest projection from the Government Accountability Office on the potential savings from switching to dollar coins entirely comes as lawmakers begin exploring new ways for the government to save money by changing the money itself.\nThe Mint is preparing a report for Congress showing how changes in the metal content of coins could save money.\nThe last time the government made major metallurgical changes in U.S. coins was nearly 50 years ago when Congress directed the Mint to remove silver from dimes and quarters and to reduce its content in half dollar coins. Now, Congress is looking at new changes in response to rising prices for copper and nickel.\nAt a House subcommittee hearing Thursday, the focus was on two approaches:\n-Moving to less expensive combinations of metals like steel, aluminum and zinc.\n-Gradually taking dollar bills out the economy and replacing them with coins.\nThe GAO's Lorelei St. James told the House Financial Services panel it would take several years for the benefits of switching from paper bills to dollar coins to catch up with the cost of making the change. Equipment would have to be bought or overhauled and more coins would have to be produced upfront to replace bills as they are taken out of circulation.\nBut over the years, the savings would begin to accrue, she said, largely because a $1 coin could stay in circulation for 30 years while paper bills have to be replaced every four or five years on average.\n\"We continue to believe that replacing the note with a coin is likely to provide a financial benefit to the government,\" said St. James, who added that such a change would work only if the note was completely eliminated and the public educated about the benefits of the switch.\nEven the $1 coin's most ardent supporters recognize that they haven't been popular. Philip Diehl, former director of the Mint, said there was a huge demand for the Sacagawea dollar coin when production began in 2001, but as time wore on, people stayed with what they knew best.\n\"We've never bitten the bullet to remove the $1 bill as every other Western economy has done,\" Diehl said. \"If you did, it would have the same success the Canadians have had.\"\nBeverly Lepine, chief operating officer of the Royal Canadian Mint, said her country loves its \"Loonie,\" the nickname for the $1 coin that includes an image of a loon on the back. The switch went over so well that the country also went to a $2 coin called the \"Toonie.\"\nRep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., affirmed that Canadians have embraced their dollar coins. \"I don't know anyone who would go back to the $1 and $2 bills,\" he said.\nThat sentiment was not shared by some of his fellow subcommittee members when it comes to the U.S. version.\nRep. Lacy Clay, D-Mo., said men don't like carrying a bunch of coins around in their pocket or in their suits. And Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said the $1 coins have proved too hard to distinguish from quarters.\n\"If the people don't want it and they don't want to use it,\" she said, \"why in the world are we even talking about changing it?\"\n\"It's really a matter of just getting used to it,\" said Diehl, the former Mint director.\nSeveral lawmakers were more intrigued with the idea of using different metal combinations in producing coins.\nRep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, said a penny costs more than 2 cents to make and a nickel costs more than 11 cents to make. Moving to multiplated steel for coins would save the government nearly $200 million a year, he said.\nThe Mint's report, which is due in mid-December, will detail the results of nearly 18 months of work exploring a variety of new metal compositions and evaluating test coins for attributes as hardness, resistance to wear, availability of raw materials and costs.\nRichard Peterson, the Mint's acting director, declined to give lawmakers a summary of what will be in the report, but he said \"several promising alternatives\" were found.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.

        "webpage": "Venture Capital And Entrepreneurial Communities Commend Congress on Passage of the JOBS Act\nNVCA Recognizes Supporters of IPO On-Ramp Which Will Smooth the IPO Path for Emerging Growth Companies\nWashington, D.C. (PRWEB)\nThe National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) praised the United States Congress for its decisive passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act today. The bill, which has now passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate, contains provisions that create a temporary regulatory and communications on-ramp for emerging growth companies that are pursuing an initial public offering (IPO). This on-ramp is viewed by the start-up ecosystem as much needed relief from the cumulative effect of costly regulations that were dissuading companies from entering the public markets. The JOBS Act now goes to President Obama who has indicated his intention to sign the bill into law.\n\"Emerging growth companies represent America's best opportunity for long term economic growth and it is critical that they have access to capital at all phases of their lifecycle,\" said Paul Maeder, general partner at Highland Capital Partners and chair of the NVCA. \"The JOBS Act will help revitalize an IPO market that has suffered in recent years under the weight of market volatility and one-size-fits-all regulation. The passage of this legislation sends a strong and welcome signal to our most promising companies that the U.S. capital markets system is open for business.\"\nThe NVCA has long supported regulatory relief for smaller companies seeking to go public, with advocacy efforts dating back over a decade. In the last ten years, research shows that venture-backed IPO volume has been just a fraction of what it was in the 1990's. Given the IHS Global Insight statistic that 92 percent of job creation at venture-backed companies occurs after an IPO, the implications of a lackluster capital markets system went beyond the venture capital industry and became an issue of U.S. competitiveness and economic viability. As the economy continued to struggle, supporters of this legislation grew, according to NVCA President Mark Heesen:\n\"There are many individuals who were instrumental in enacting this bill into law,\" said Heesen. \"The bipartisan, bicameral leadership of Senators Schumer (D-NY) and Toomey (R-PA), with support from Senators Crapo (R-ID) and Warner (D-VA), and Representatives Fincher (R-TN) and Carney (D-DE) were critical to crafting, introducing, and championing the legislation through a comprehensive review process. There were thousands of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who signed letters and personally reached out to their congressional representatives in support of the bill. But the IPO Task Force, led by Scale Venture Partners managing director and former NVCA chairman Kate Mitchell, played perhaps the most critical role.\" Assembled in the summer of 2011, the IPO Task Force was comprised of private professionals operating in the capital markets ecosystem, including IPO buyers, and committed to identifying the challenges faced by emerging growth companies and developing recommendations on how to address these issues. The IPO On-Ramp report was released in October 2011 and helped inform key parts of the JOBS Act. Once signed by the President, the law will be effective immediately and thousands of companies will have access to the on-ramp when they are ready to go public.\n\"With the passage of the JOBS Act and specifically with the IPO On-Ramp provisions, U.S. companies such as ours that are committed to job creation and innovation now have a smoother path to access capital to grow their businesses and have a positive impact on the economy,\" said Ben Wolin, chief executive officer and co-founder of Everyday Health, Inc, a new media company headquartered in New York City inspiring consumers to live healthier lives and helping doctors make more-informed decision for their patients. \"Everyday Health helps people make healthy changes in their life, and thanks to the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can be in a healthier position where they can contribute more economically than in the last decade. We look forward to the value created for consumers, clients, employees and investors.\"\nAbout the National Venture Capital Association\nVenture capitalists are committed to funding America's most innovative entrepreneurs, working closely with them to transform breakthrough ideas into emerging growth companies that drive U.S. job creation and economic growth. According to a 2011 Global Insight study, venture-backed companies accounted for 12 million jobs and $3.1 trillion in revenue in the United States in 2010. As the voice of the U.S. venture capital community, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) empowers its members and the entrepreneurs they fund by advocating for policies that encourage innovation and reward long-term investment.

        "webpage": "Securities Auth. Proposing 'Distress Funds' Tal Levy, Moti Bassok and Zvi Zrahiya Nov 25, 2008 2:38 AM\nThe Israel Securities Authority is to initiate distress funds, whose purpose will be to invest in corporate bonds, thereby injecting liquidity into the capital market. The funds are to be owned by the government and private entities. The ISA has also proposed (although no agreement has been reached) that the state provide guarantees to banks in order to increase the supply of corporate credit. Meanwhile, at internal discussions within the treasury, the cost of the safety net for provident fund members is being estimated at about NIS 10 billion, spread over a number of years. The final amount will be determined after the treasury decides which of the models are to be implemented. Lengthy discussions, some of them led by Finance Minister Roni Bar-On, were held yesterday with the aim of reaching a final decision on the plan, with the participation of all the heads of the ministry and their assisting teams. Top-ranking ministry officials say that the talks are near completion. The plan, they say, will be a limited one, and will focus on providing a safety net for pension savings for persons over the age of 60, who have incomes of less than double the minimum wage, NIS 7,700 a month. The safety net will be in effect as of the date of its approval by the Knesset, not retroactively to the beginning of the capital market crisis. Pension savings will be linked to the Consumer Price Index, with a relatively low interest rate that will not exceed 3-4%. In practice, the plan will compensate only a few tens of thousands of provident fund members, and will benefit almost no pension fund members, because the vast majority of savers who are 60 years or more old belong to the old pension funds, which have been unaffected by the events of the past few months, since they are invested in designated government bonds. Economists involved in the discussions currently under way in Jerusalem estimated yesterday that the safety net planned by the treasury will expose the state to a loss of NIS 9 billion for every 10% fall of the markets. A ministry spokesman declined to comment on assessments. At the same time, Attorney General Menachem Mazuz ruled that the bailout plan for the capital market being drawn up by the treasury is not to be considered \"election economics\" - thereby giving a green light to spread the safety net. Sources in the treasury noted yesterday that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has asked to see the ministry's recommendation before it is made public, although he rejected the option of the proposal being forwarded to him in Washington, where he is visiting at the moment. In a phone conversation between Bar-On and Olmert yesterday, the two agreed that only after the premier's return to Israel would he see the recommendations and discuss them with the heads of the Bank of Israel and the treasury. Netanyahu's plan In a meeting with Olmert last Thursday, Likud chairman Benjamin Netanyahu presented his own plan. According to its terms, the state would provide a \"safety net\" of NIS 20 billion to institutional investors, for purchase of corporate bonds. The guarantees, with a lifetime of 10 years, would assured annual adjusted yields of 3-4% on corporate-bond investments. The plan does not address provident fund members or tycoons, but corporate bonds. Nevertheless, strengthening of corporate bonds will improve the position of pension savers and tycoons alike. According to Netanyahu's consultants, in the best case scenario, if the value of the bonds exceeds the \"safety net,\" the plan would cost the government nothing. In the worst case, the plan could cost the government a few tens of billions of shekels over a period of 10 years - a burden that the treasury can handle.

Total student debt outstanding appears to have surpassed $1 trillion late last year, said officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency created in the wake of the financial crisis. That would be roughly 16% higher than an estimate earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Total student debt outstanding appears to have surpassed $1 trillion late last year, roughly 16% higher than an estimate earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Joshua Mitchell has details on Markets Hub. (Photo: AP/Reed Saxon)\nThe new figure - released Wednesday at a banking conference in Austin, Texas - is a preliminary finding from a study of student debt that the bureau plans to release this summer. Bureau officials said the estimate is based on a survey of private lenders, as opposed to other estimates that rely on a sampling of consumer credit reports. CFPB officials say student debt is rising for several reasons, including a surge in Americans going to college in recent years to escape the weak labor market. Also, tuition increases - which many colleges say are needed to offset big cuts in state funding - have many students taking out bigger loans. In addition, the interest costs on older loans are climbing as borrowers fall behind on payments, reflecting mounting financial strains, bureau officials said. New York Fed data show that as many as one in four student borrowers who have begun repaying their education debts are behind on payments. More Law School Wins in Graduate Suit Economists say college is an increasingly good investment because of the widening pay gap between jobs that require a degree and those that don't. Ultimately, the educational degrees and added skills are meant to help workers earn higher incomes that, in time, will more than offset the student debt. But as more people go to college and assume bigger loans for education, they may take longer than previous generations to hit key milestones such as buying a house or getting married, U.S. officials and economists say. It could take longer for heavily indebted graduates to save money for a down payment on a home, or it could be harder for them to qualify for mortgages. Rohit Chopra, student-loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said student debt could ultimately slow the recovery of the housing market. \"First-time home-buyers are a substantial part of the housing market,\" Mr. Chopra said in a speech at the banking conference in Austin. \"Instead of saving for a down payment, these borrowers are sending big payments every month.\" Student debt is a burden not just for recent college graduates in their 20s but also parents, who often co-sign their children's student loans, as well as midcareer professionals who opted to go back to school during the sluggish recovery. David Johnson, a 58-year-old groundskeeper from Milton, Wash., decided to leave gardening after more than two decades to become a nurse. Two years ago, he took out about $18,000 in private and federal loans to attend a local community college that had a nursing program. After completing prerequisite classes, he learned that the program had a waiting list. With no guarantee of getting into the nursing program, he is wondering whether to take out more debt to continue in school. \"It's an awkward place to be. I'm not yet a nurse but I've got all this debt and interest compounding on me,\" he said. \"I don't have a lot of working years left and I'm saddled with this debt.\" Write to Josh Mitchell at  4"

We're seeing time and time again there is a significant gap between various ethnic groups ... and the reasons tend to be embedded in cultural differences,\" he says.\nWhile he's quick to add that the study reveals more similarities than differences, African American and Hispanic respondents tend to use shorter time horizons when it comes to financial planning, which, he says, can get in the way of saving enough for retirement.\nA new ING study, which was commissioned by the ING Retirement Research Institute and polled households with incomes over $40,000, found that 31 percent of African Americans, a higher percentage than any other group, list debt as an obstacle to saving, but they also were more financially prepared in certain areas, such as life insurance coverage.\nThe study found that 1 in 4 African American respondents had life insurance valued at four to five times their current salary, compared with just 18 percent of total respondents.\nThe ING study also found that Hispanic respondents were more likely to sacrifice their own financial future for their children, a choice Makonnen says is most common among first-generation immigrants.\n\"If you're first-generation, the family unity is much stronger, especially in the Hispanic community. Over time, you'll see less and less of that leaning on family as a financial security blanket,\" he says.\nA recent Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll similarly revealed that African American women are more likely to loan money to family or friends compared with white women (60 percent versus 52 percent) and to help friends or family with child care on a regular basis (36 percent versus 24 percent for white women).\nIn the ING study, Asian American respondents were the most prepared for retirement; on average, they had built savings of $81,000 in employee-sponsored plans, such as 401(k)s and $58,000 in other types of savings vehicles, such as CDs and IRAs.\nBy comparison, Hispanic respondents reported having just $54,000 saved in retirement savings accounts.\nMeanwhile, Asian American respondents demonstrated a different weak spot: estate planning. They were the least likely group to have a last will and testament (26 percent) compared with 37 percent of white respondents. Asian-American respondents were also more likely to prioritize splurges such as a nice car or home, over retirement savings.\n\"Overall, Asians seem to believe that purchasing short-term goods and materials is a sign of success, and having physical possessions is very important,\" says Makonnen.\n[10 Ways to Save Your Retirement]\nThe ING study clearly demonstrated that the challenge of saving for retirement cuts across all ethnic groups. Close to half of all ethnic groups said they feel unprepared for retirement, ranging from 54 percent of Hispanic respondents to 44 percent of Asian American respondents.\nAnd when it comes to planning, close to 30 percent of all groups reported having formal investment plans, ranging from 28 percent for white respondents to 32 percent for African American respondents.\nThese findings suggest to Makonnen than banks can provide better tools and resources to reach out to certain groups to help them plan for retirement, he says. He works with historically black colleges and universities, for example, to launch \"culturally-relevant\" financial literacy programs.\nBecause the study found that Hispanic and African American respondents were especially likely to look to their employers for retirement planning assistance, he also wants to investigate how ING can help employers with that. \"[Employees] are not going to seek out information if they're not in their comfort zone,\" he says.\nAmong all groups, Makonnen adds, \"We're seeing less emphasis on planning going forward.\" That's a trend he wants to help reverse.\nThis post originally appeared on U.S. News & World Report.

        "webpage": "Consumer confidence falls in March by\n10:53 PM, Tuesday, March 26 2013 | 494 views | 0 | 4 | | The Conference Board, a New York-based private research group, said its reading of consumer confidence fell in March after rebounding last month. The index gauges how Americans are feeling about their jobs, incomes and other bread-and-butter issues. That's important because consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. (ASSOCIATED PRESS / Gene J. Puskar)\nWASHINGTON (AP)  -  Americans are less confident in the economy than they were last month as massive government spending cuts have stoked economic uncertainty.It's just the latest swing in the way Americans feel about the economy. Their views have fluctuated between optimism and angst over the months as they've weighed an advancing stock market and housing recovery against new economic challenges. The Conference Board, a New York-based private research group, said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index fell in March to 59.7 from a revised reading of 68 in February and the 68.7 that analysts polled by research firm FactSet expected. Confidence is still far off from the 90 reading that indicates a healthy economy.The index is closely watched by economists because it makes a monthly gauge of how Americans are feeling about their jobs, incomes and other bread-and-butter issues. That's important because consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. Anxiety about $85 billion in across-the-board government spending cuts that took effect March 1 caused the decline in the index, the group said. The spending reductions, which were triggered after Congress and the White House failed to resolve a budget impasse, have \"created uncertainty regarding the economic outlook,\" Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's director of economic indicators, said in a statementCongress and the Obama administration reached a deal on Jan. 1 to prevent income taxes from rising on most Americans. But they allowed a temporary cut in Social Security taxes to expire. For a worker earning $50,000 a year, take-home pay will shrink by about $1,000.That has a more direct impact on most Americans than the government spending reductions, noted Scott Brown, chief economist at investment firm Raymond James. The March drop in the confidence index \"likely reflects the impact of higher gasoline prices as well as the higher payroll tax,\" Brown said. Although the payroll tax increase kicked in three months ago, its effect may just now be sinking in for some people, he suggested. The Conference Board's survey was conducted from March 1 through March 14. The sharp decline in the March index was caused mainly by a drop in expectations for the economy, though consumers also were more pessimistic regarding current economic conditions, the group said. The number of people anticipating more jobs in the months ahead fell to 12.3 percent from 16.1 percent, while those expecting their incomes to increase slipped to 13.7 percent from 15.8 percent.Consumers also are again pessimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy, the group said. The proportion of people expecting business conditions to improve over the next six months fell to 14.4 percent from 18 percent a month earlier, while those expecting conditions to worsen rose to 18.3 percent from 16.6 percent.Chris Christopher, director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight, said he expects consumer confidence to recover as the \"shock value\" of the mandated spending cuts wanes. However, \"smaller paychecks, depressed consumer mood, and rising (gasoline) prices are not very favorable for elevated levels of discretionary spending,\" Christopher wrote in a research note.The index comes as Americans are seeing some signs of an improving economy.Stock prices have roughly doubled since June 2009. And the job market, while still tough, is rebounding. Employers added 236,000 jobs in February, driving the unemployment rate down to 7.7 percent, its lowest level in more than four years. The gains signaled that companies are confident enough in the economy to intensify hiring even in the face of tax increases and government spending cuts. Americans spent more at retailers in February despite the smaller paychecks, according to a Commerce Department report issued on March 13. Much of the increase in retail sales compared with January reflected higher gasoline prices. But even excluding the volatile categories of gas, autos and building supply stores, so-called core retail sales rose strongly. The healthier-than-expected numbers prompted some experts to revise their estimates of U.S. economic growth for the January-March quarter. And the Conference Board's measure of the U.S. economy's health over the next six months, reported on Thursday, increased in February from January.\nMorgan leads revamped group of Arkansas receivers\nObituary: William Hughes\nObituary: James Casey"

EMIR's definition of \"derivatives\" cross-refers to the list of financial instruments enumerated in Annex I to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID).[2]\nThe source of the harmonisation problem is the use of a defined term in an EU regulation (which takes direct effect throughout the EU) when that defined term cross-refers to a definition set out in an EU directive (which relies on each member state of the EU to implement it in their local law as the state sees fit).\nThe different transpositions of MiFID into local law across member states mean that there is no single, commonly adopted definition of \"derivative\" in the EU, thus preventing the convergent application of EMIR EU-wide (as well as other directives that rely on MiFID definitions of financial instruments). This is contrary to the purpose behind the use of an EU regulation.\nDifferent definitions of \"derivative\" may result in the inconsistent application of EMIR, which has a primary objective of regulating derivatives transactions. ESMA notes that this is particularly the case for foreign exchange (FX) forwards and physically settled commodity forwards.\nDifferent classifications of what constitutes a derivative will create an unlevel playing field for market participants in the following ways:\nThe trade reporting of certain transactions in one member state and not in others.\nWith reference to the calculation of the clearing threshold for non-financial counterparties (NFCs) from which derive NFCs' obligations under EMIR - certain financial instruments may be included in the calculation in some member states and excluded in other member states.\nA central counterparty established in one member state may face higher margin requirements than another central counterparty in a different member state, given that, under EMIR, margin requirements are higher for over-the-counter derivatives than for other financial instruments.\nFurthermore, if different classifications of what constitutes a \"derivative\" are adopted, neither the clearing obligation nor the risk mitigation obligations would apply uniformly EU-wide, contravening EMIR's objectives.\nIn order to achieve consistent application of EMIR, ESMA considers it is essential to clarify the references to the MiFID definitions in the context of EMIR and has invited the Commission to urgently adopt a legislative measure that will, in particular, clarify the definition of the following:\nCurrency derivatives in relation to (a) the frontier between spot and forward and (b) their conclusion for commercial purposes\nCommodity forwards that can be physically settled\nPending such clarity, market participants find themselves awkwardly placed - unsure whether certain transactions are subject to EMIR and potentially subject to enforcement action by regulators for failing to comply with EMIR. To avoid the inconsistent application of EMIR across the EU, ESMA has helpfully published its understanding that - until the Commission provides clarification, and to the extent permitted under national law - national regulators will not implement the relevant provisions of EMIR for contracts that are not clearly identified as derivatives across the EU. This includes, in particular, FX forwards with a settlement date up to seven days, FX forwards concluded for commercial purposes, and physically settled commodity forwards.\n[1].

Curry\nEven before President Obama released his budget proposal this week for the next fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, preliminary details about his plan to effectively cut Social Security cost of living increases has caused a firestorm among supporters who now feel betrayed.\nUnder the plan, Obama would shift the way federal benefits are indexed from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to the \"chained\" CPI, gradually reducing benefit payments. Without getting overly technical, the chained CPI - a way of indexing living costs - has grown on average by about 0.3 percentage points per year more slowly than the official CPI. Social Security actuaries assume the gap between the two CPIs will continue to average 0.3 percentage points per year in the future;\nFormer Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich said in a MoveOn.org press release that\n\"Social Security is not driving the deficit, therefore it should not be part of reforms aimed at cutting the deficit.\" He added, \"The chained CPI, deceptively portrayed as a reasonable cost-of-living adjustment, is a cut to Social Security that would hurt seniors.\"\nWhite House officials point out that the chained CPI would not affect initial Social Security benefits because they are based on wages. It is the subsequent cost of living increases that would be affected.\nAccording to an analysis by the Associated Press, Social Security benefits for a typical middle-income 65-year-old would be about $136 less a year under the new indexing. At age 75, annual benefits would be $560 less. At 85, the cut would be $984 a year. While that might not seem huge to some, it represents a significant loss of income from the elderly living on a fixed income.\nSenator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) shares Robert Reich's outrage.\n\"If Obama is serious about dealing with our deficit, he would not cut Social Security - which has not added one penny to the deficit,\" Sanders said in a statement posted on his website. \"Instead, he would support legislation that ends the absurdity of one out of four profitable corporations paying nothing in federal income taxes. He would also help us close the offshore tax haven loopholes that enable large corporations and the wealthy to avoid paying $100 billion a year in federal taxes.\"\nSocial Security payments and COLAs are not limited to the elderly. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, approximately 6 million children under age 18 (8 percent of all U.S. children) lived in families that received income from Social Security in 2011. That includes children who received their benefits as dependents of retired, disabled, or deceased workers as well as those who live with parents or relatives who received Social Security benefits.\nDemocrats are irked that Obama is breaking a pledge he made in 2008 not to cut Social Security. And regardless of how he couches it, that's the net effect of his action.\n\"You can't call yourself a Democrat and support Social Security benefit cuts,\" said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \"... The president has no mandate to cut these benefits, and progressives will do everything possible to stop him.\"\nCURRY: Obama's Showdown with 'Teapublicans' is Just Beginning Support"

        "webpage": "New Insights About Consumer Adoption of Payments Innovation\nSteve Levitt of Freakonomics fame and PayPal's Don Kingsborough to lead discussion of industry CEOs at The Innovation Project on March 20th at Harvard University\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Payments is a two-sided business. It requires the engagement of both merchants and consumers. So anything that is intended to \"innovate\" payments better deliver enough value to both sides so that both merchants and consumers have the incentives to move away from what they know works today to the promise of something that might work better in the future.\nTurns out, that's a big deal. And getting consumers and merchants to change the ingrained habits that dictate their behaviors isn't easy. Finding the hidden clues that can unlock those behaviors is tasked to one of seven CEO panels that are a part of The Innovation Project 2013, a program hosted by PYMNTS.com on March 20-21 at Harvard University and designed to change the way that the payments and its broader commerce ecosystem thinks, talks, delivers and ignites innovation. Steve Levitt, economist, University of Chicago professor and author of Freakonomics, and Don Kingsborough, VP of POS Innovation at PayPal and former CEO of Blackhawk, will lead one such discussion entitled Shoponomics: Uncovering The Hidden Clues For How Consumers Buy And How They Pay.\nKingsborough, whose job it is to lead PayPal into the offline world, knows first-hand the complexities of igniting a new network of any kind. He did it with Blackhawk, the gift card network now readying for an IPO, and says, \"getting consumers to adopt any new thing and having retailers adopt at the same time is difficult.\"\nAnd this is where the words of Levitt may be extremely insightful: \"The conventional wisdom is often wrong.\"\nHe has a point.\nSquare was never about the dongle; it was about a new business model that made it possible for micro merchants to get a merchant account - and use the dongle as a way to convert their phones into acceptance devices. Today it is about creating a new merchant-consumer network.\nStarbucks' mobile app was never about payment via mobile; it was about using the phone to give people better information about their prepaid card balances - which was then bundled with payment.\nLevelUp wasn't about offering zero interchange to merchants; it was about giving consumers a credit pegged to the frequency of visits to their favorite merchants - which created the basis for a new business model that, in turn, pegged merchant payments to a percentage of that credit.\nM-Pesa wasn't about replacing cash with the mobile phone; it was about giving Kenyans a safer way to send money to their relatives in the villages - which in turn, increased the amount of cash circulating in that economy as money was transferred from person to person in a safer, easier and more reliable way.\nIn every single one of these cases, trusting \"conventional wisdom\" would have gotten these innovators very little and probably into a heap of trouble (and debt).\nAs part of the panel facilitated by Levitt and Kingsborough, four of the most dynamic innovators in payments will give The Innovation Project 2013 delegates a first-hand account of what happened when they turned conventional wisdom on its ear and gave consumers something new to use when shopping or paying.\nDan Henry, CEO of NetSpend, says that it \"provides something that better meets the financial services needs of its customers than a traditional bank account\" yet prepaid remains one of the least sticky financial services products on the market. Dan will share the good, the bad, the ugly and the behavioral economics of the alternative banking product that few have managed to make pay (for themselves) and that NetSpend seems to have been able to deliver.\nAlex Rampell, CEO of TrialPay, kicked conventional wisdom to the curb years ago when he realized that many people like to buy many things but few people like to buy all things especially the stuff that may be good for you but not all that exciting. TrialPay at its inception was all about getting people to acquire the stuff they may have wanted but didn't want to pay for (or pay full p"

It is expected to focus on measures such as boosting infrastructure spending and fiscal discipline to achieve the growth target.\n\nAbbott said G20 leaders will produce a short, three-page communique in \"plain language\" when they meet in Brisbane in November.\n\n\"Australia's task is to keep the G20 totally focused on economic growth and to resist the temptation to deal with every ill that the world may face,\" Abbott said.\n\nThe B20, set up in 2010 to give policy recommendations on behalf of the international business community to the G20, says addressing a $57 trillion shortfall in global infrastructure through to 2030 will be crucial in meeting this goal.\n\nBut the group has criticised cumbersome global rules and long delays to approval processes that make it hard for large pension funds and insurance companies to invest in major infrastructure projects.\n\nAbbott is supportive of the infrastructure goal, saying Australia is leading by example, investing A$50 billion ($46.8 billion) in a rolling 15-year list of infrastructure priorities.\n\nBut he is also stressing fiscal discipline. His Conservative-led Coalition government delivered a tough budget earlier this year and is scrapping controversial taxes on carbon and mining as it tackles what is says are unsustainable deficits due to total A$60 billion over the next four years.\n\n\"We really are at the limits of what macro measures can do to drive growth,\" Abbott said. \"We need to manage the exit from unconventional monetary policy and to restore government's fiscal position to sustainability.\"\n\nAbbott was also receptive to lobbying by the G20 to reduce financial regulation, which Australia and New Zealand Banking Group CEO Michael Smith said on Wednesday was deterring infrastructure investment and limiting the provision of trade finance.\n\n\"We need to unshackle business by reducing regulation and by accepting that some risk is unavoidable,\" Abbott said."

He blames deregulation for the economic problems in this country. History has proven that when the free market has been unleashed from government regulations, economic prosperity has exploded. Following World War II, a sharp reduction in government spending and controls sparked an economic boom that defied conventional wisdom. Mainline historians and big-government politicians still maintain that the main reason for Europe's economic resurgence after the war was the Marshall Plan. Actually, it only had a minor effect on the Europe's economic recovery. The United States gave $25 billion (about 10 percent of America's gross domestic product) for the Marshall Plan, supposedly to rebuild Europe and its devastated infrastructure and economies. Professor Thomas Woods, author of \"Politically Incorrect Guide to American History,\" wrote that the Marshall Plan \"worked no better than any other giveaway program. France and Italy began their economic recoveries before any Marshal Plan aid was distributed. Austria and Greece began to recover only as [the Marshall Pan] aid was being phased out.... Marshal Plan propagandists have attempted to take credit for the West German's miraculous economic recovery.\" Photo Galleries\nWage and price controls installed by the Nazis remained in force after the war, worsening the economic devastation. The German economic miracle began only when government controls were lifted, long before the arrival of the Marshall Plan \"aid.\"\nAfter the war, Congress abolished the unconstitutional Office of Price Administration, which was created by executive order. The unelected OPA officials had been given power to freeze prices. About 90 percent of the prices of retail products were fixed by government mandate. Fixed wages and prices created shortages of essential items. President Calvin Coolidge produced an unprecedented level of prosperity in America with his deregulation policies and vetoes that prevented government intervention into the free market. Speaking of Coolidge's administration, President Reagan stated, \"We had probably the greatest growth and prosperity that we've ever known.\""

An asset-price bubble caused the last recession. Long-term interest rates should be higher and will eventually rise, and there will be losses,\" said Martin Feldstein, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan, headed the National Bureau of Economic Research for 30 years and is now an economics professor at Harvard University. \"I think this is a bubble that will cause a lot of pain,\" he said.Feldstein also said he expected U.S. economic growth to be \"quite weak\" this year as a result of automatic federal spending cuts that began March 1 and tax increases enacted at the beginning of the year as part of a deal between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress to avert the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" of expiring tax cuts. He made the comments during the general meeting of the Washington, D.C.-based American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group for 24 steelmakers and 123 suppliers and customers, at Broadmoor Hall.The automatic budget cuts and tax increases will trim at least 1.1 percentage points from the nation's economic growth rate, which could end up being less than 1 percent this year and offset much of the benefit from an improving housing industry, a booming stock market and expansion of the nation's energy industry, Feldstein said. A continuing recession in Europe, slowing economic growth in Asia that is expected to reduce exports and lackluster growth in consumer spending from stubbornly high unemployment also will be drags on economic growth, he said.Feldstein criticized the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep long-term interest rates low as ineffective in stimulating economic growth, contributing to the bubble he warned about and fueling future inflation after the economy has begun to recover. He is worried the nation's central bank will wait too long into an economic recovery to raise interest rates, allowing inflation to gain momentum and making it more difficult to bring it back under control. He remains concerned that growing federal deficits and debt will eventually force interest rates higher.He recommended reducing federal income tax breaks to increase revenue and reducing the growth in federal health care benefits for the elderly, but said a continued stalemate between a Democratic president and Senate and a Republican House is likely to continue for several more years, resulting in continued growth in the federal government's debt. Feldstein also said he doesn't expect much improvement this year in the European or Asian economies, especially since plans to reduce deficits and government debt have been shelved in several European countries.-Contact Wayne Heilman: 636-0234 Twitter @wayneheilmanFacebook Wayne Heilman\nCheck out this article on Colorado Springs Gazette:"

Published in late 1787 and early 1788, they illuminate key ideas behind America's constitutional creation, including the federal taxing power.\nWritten by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, the Federalist Papers served a dual rhetorical purpose.

At various points, they expounded on the efficacy and fairness of consumption taxes, specifically customs duties. They insisted, however, that the federal government be granted unlimited taxing powers, including the authority to assess domestic excise taxes.

Even so, they do not begin to capture the mad churn of the economy: the growth and bankruptcy of firms; the millions of firings and hirings, which unemployment statistics barely summarize; the movement of goods and services around the world; and the ebb and flow of consumer fads. Under the circumstances, it is strange that economists do not have a satisfactory way of talking about change, yet we do not.\nAs any undergraduate student of economics knows, both microeconomists and macroeconomists tend to describe change in the same way that an advertisement for dishwashing detergent does: \"before\" and \"after.\" When oil cost $20 a barrel, the economy looked like this; now that oil costs $100 a barrel, the economy looks like that. Quite how the process of change occurred - or how quickly - is a problem glossed over in the textbooks and most journals. Advertisement\nThat is worrying. Perhaps it does not even make sense to compare two static \"before\" and \"after\" states; perhaps \"during\" is everything. In fairness, economists are not blind to this problem. Back in 1923, John Maynard Keynes warned that \"[e]conomists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is flat again.\" He was not the only one with reservations. Yet identifying the problem is easier than solving it, at least using the mathematical tools with which economists are familiar.\nSeveral popular books have argued that economists could learn about dynamics from approaches developed in the sciences. Malcolm Gladwell, a journalist, wrote an entire book, The Tipping Point,devoted to the idea that innovations, fashions, and other ideas spread through society in much the same way as a disease does. Read his New Yorker article that helped inspire the book here. Philip Ball, a science writer, attacked economics more directly in his book, Critical Mass, arguing that economists should learn from physicists' understanding of dynamic processes, such as phase transitions. (An example of a phase transition is when cold water suddenly turns to ice. It turns out that, for example, traffic flows can exhibit phase transitions.) Still others advise economists to look to models of evolutionary dynamics.\nThis is all sage advice, but the details matter. Duncan Watts, who studies dynamic processes on networks, has discovered that neither Ball nor Gladwell has the whole story. Ideas can spread through an economy like a disease or like a phase transition - it all depends on how the social networks along which the ideas flow are connected.\nThe Tipping Point focused much attention on highly connected individuals - the \"connectors\" or the \"influencers\" - who were able to spread anything from a fashion trend to a new software release. Gladwell concentrated on them because epidemiologists knew that diseases often spread through such \"connectors.\" But while that is a sensible way of thinking about the spread of a physically contagious disease, Watts points out that ideas can flow along many more connections than do diseases. Perhaps a very complex and difficult idea - a new school of philosophy, perhaps, or a radical approach to software coding - might indeed spread from one expert to another, and live or die depending on whether the \"connectors\" get involved.\nBut if the ideas we are talking about are what MP3 to download or what cut of jeans to wear, the epidemiological model does not apply. Everyone is connected to everyone else, and a new trend will either ripple through the economy like a near-instantaneous phase transition or it will ripple nowhere at all because it never gets started. And in either case, the \"connectors\" will be irrelevant, because we're all so interconnected anyway. My guess is that it is just a matter of time before economists embrace methods from other disciplines in an effort to understand dynamic processes better than we do. But it would be a shame if we looked only to physicists, chemists, and biologists for advice; something would be missing if we did. Duncan Watts, after all, is a sociologist.\nTim Harford is a Financial Times columnist. His latest book, The Logic of Life, will be published in paperback on Feb. 10."

Hochberg, the bank's chairman and president.\nHochberg made these claims while unveiling the bank's annual report on competitiveness Tuesday in Washington. He spoke in strong terms about the movement in Congress to shut down the Ex-Im Bank by not reauthorizing its charter when it comes due in 2014. He contrasted the \"bruising congressional fight every two or three years\" to refund the agency to foreign competition that simply does what it takes to win new business.\nShutting down the agency, he said, would be detrimental to exports in the United States. It would erase the $50 billion worth of exports the bank financed in 2012 and the 255,000 jobs it created. Congress has also called on the Treasury Department to look into ending export credits, thinking that a free marketplace is a better arena for exports, he said.\n\"To end export credits, when our competitors are playing by a completely different set of rules and increasing government support by leaps and bounds  -  many of them operating with no rules whatsoever  -  this would be a self-inflicted wound our economy cannot sustain,\" Hochberg said in his speech. Holding the agency back, or even shutting it down altogether, would ensure that foreign competition has a leg up on generating exports. Hochberg pointed out that these competitors already offer astounding credit deals like 100-percent financing on 40-year loans with 1 or 2 percent interest due to government funding options.\n\"In the real world, our private-enterprises are pitted against an array of competitors that are often government-owned, government-protected, government-subsidized, government-sponsored, or all of the above,\" he said.\nExports are a $2.2-trillion piece of the $16 trillion economic puzzle, and President Obama's National Export Initiative has already helped create 1.3 million jobs, he said, emphasizing the fact that exports are leading the national recovery.\n\"Ending export credits prematurely will only push more of the business to the shadows,\" he said. \"And that won't serve American companies and American workers.\"\nIn the bank's 2013 competitiveness report, it noted the financial crisis has made the export game more competitive, with governments around the world trying desperately to jumpstart their economies with exports. Europe is also no longer the biggest competitor to the United States, and these competitors are offering potential clients funding outside of agreed-upon measures created by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nIn this challenging and changing world, Hochberg said, Ex-Im Bank needs full government support and the ability to function without the fear of being shut down in order to compete effectively. - Jon Ross\nFWI: U.S. cargo theft value up despite decrease in volume\nCargo thefts in the United States were up 7 percent in value despite falling 18 percent by volume in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the second quarter, according to the FreightWatch International Q3 2015 U.S. Cargo Theft Report.\nPort of Oakland in talks with CenterPoint to build logistics complex\nThe Northern California port and industrial and logistics real estate developer CenterPoint Properties have begun discussing plans to develop transload and cross-dock facilities on a 20 acre site adjacent to a new rail yard at the Port of Oakland.\nHouse passes (another) stop-gap highway patch\nLegislators had hoped to pass a multi-year bill by Thanksgiving, but instead opted for a measure to extend federal transportation spending through Dec. 4 to avoid a funding shutdown when the current three-week authorization expires Friday."

Photograph: Stephen Jaffe /REUTERS\nPhillip Inman\nMonday 13 September 2010 13.08 EDT\nThe International Monetary Fund undermined the main thrust of the UK coalition's economic strategy today after it warned western governments that they risked holding back the recovery and creating a massive pool of disaffected labour if they pursued draconian cuts in spending.\nIMF director general, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told a conference in Oslo that governments needed to identify ways to generate employment to prevent a generation of workers losing their skills and joining the long-term unemployed. He said cuts in public spending had a \"human cost\" and could result in \"tragedy\" for millions of young people.\nHis speech will add to pressure on the chancellor, George Osborne, after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the rich nations' thinktank, said last week that cutting budget deficits this year risked derailing economic recovery.\nAnalysis by the IMF and the OECD is expected to feature in campaigns by trade unions and rivals for the Labour leadership at the TUC conference this week.\nEd Balls, the Labour leadership candidate, said the government needed to scrap much of its programme of cuts in favour of projects that create jobs and generate growth. The shadow chancellor, Alistair Darling, said the reports from the OECD and IMF showed the prevailing economic analysis was firmly allied to Labour's argument for cuts to be delayed until the economic recovery was secure and unemployment falling.\nStrauss-Kahn said: \"The labour market is in dire straits. The Great Recession has left behind a wasteland of unemployment, and this devastation threatens the livelihood, security and dignity of millions of people across the world.\"\nHe said the severity of the recession was in part to blame, but also how the fallout from the recession affected particular sectors.\nIn a reference to the UK, Ireland, Spain and the US, which suffered a banking crisis made worse by the after-effects of a housing bubble, he said: \"Job loss was greatest in countries where housing and financial markets collapsed. Most of this came from manufacturing and construction, showing that ordinary workers have paid the price for mistakes made elsewhere.\"\nThe International Labour Organisation, which hosted the conference with the IMF and Norwegian government, has estimated that 34 million more people worldwide are unemployed as a result of the crisis. The latest data on unemployment showed the increase took the total unemployment figure to about 210 million, which is the highest level of official unemployment in history.\nWith 45 million new job seekers a year entering the labour force, Strauss-Kahn said the situation was likely to worsen.\n\"And what about the human costs? This is the real tragedy,\" he said. \"Unemployment leads to a loss of earnings that is both substantial and long-lasting, especially among younger people. The crisis hit them especially hard.\n\"We must not underestimate the daunting prospect we face: a lost generation, disconnected from the labour market, with a progressive loss of skills and motivation.\n\"And the human costs do not end there,\" he added. \"If you lose your job, you are more likely to suffer from health problems, or even die younger. If you lose your job, your children are likely to do worse in school. If you lose your job, you are less likely to have faith in public institutions and democracy.\"\nGlobal recession\nUnemployment and employment statistics\nUK unemployment and employment statistics"

Also included was a provision allowing businesses to write off immediately half the value of new investments, known as 50 percent bonus depreciation.\nThe legislation also includes a wide range of other favours for select industries, including tax breaks for railroad track maintenance, restaurant and retail store improvements, auto racetracks, film and television production, and rum production in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\nWIND POWER BACKED\nNumerous tax breaks for wind power production and other alternative energy technologies were also included.\n\"This agreement might not be seen as perfect by everyone, but it gives American consumers and businesses the certainty they need to put worries over this issue behind them,\" said Matthew Shay, head of the National Retail Federation.\nWashington's army of business tax lobbyists need not fear that the bill will leave them with nothing left to do. Just as notable as what is in the deal is what is not, especially when it comes to reducing the federal deficit.\nThe legislation postpones for two months the deep federal spending cuts, known as the \"sequester,\" that were a central worry of the \"fiscal cliff.\" That delay could set up another fiscal cliff in late February, analysts said.\nCorporate America has dedicated millions of dollars in recent months to lobbying lawmakers for deficit and debt reduction, seen as crucial to preserving the nation's credit standing and financial power. The legislation would do little on that.\nNO 'TERRITORIAL' SYSTEM\nThe compromise also makes no mention of setting up a new method of taxing profits made offshore and brought into the country by U.S. multinational corporations. Many such businesses have been pushing for a \"territorial system\" that would let them bring foreign-earned profits home with little or no taxation.\nThe White House did note in its summary of the legislation that it left \"substantial scope' for \"reforming corporate taxes\" and cutting the corporate tax rate to make it more competitive with the rate in other industrialized countries.\nThat had been a key goal of lobbyists.\nGuggenheim Partners policy analyst Chris Krueger said the deal was \"far above what was expected\" for business.\nHe said: \"On the deficit reduction side of things, it was clearly a miss, but I suspect they will take the short-term certainty with extenders over entitlement reform any day.\"\nOn the other side of the business tax fence, advocates of closing special loopholes that help certain industries had reason to be disappointed. The legislation contains no mention of ending key tax breaks for the oil and gas business, or for senior managers of private equity firms and hedge funds.\nAlso left out was a proposal once trumpeted by Obama, in a piece of political symbolism, to end accelerated depreciation of corporate jets. An Obama proposal to end last-in-first-out accounting, a cost-saving business accounting method, also was nowhere in sight.\nThose omissions from the compromise plan mean much work remains for those wishing to overhaul the US tax code. That is a project that may or may not materialize in 2013. - Reuters\nUS Congress | tax | Fiscal Cliff | More Analysis, Interviews, Opinions Stories"

        "webpage": "Parsing the Political Debate on Dodd-Frank\nWritten by: TheStreet Guest Contributor\nBy Rory Eakin NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Dodd-Frank has been touted as the most sweeping financial regulatory reform since the Great Depression. But its impact on small business lending should be negligible. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act began as an 848-page document, and the rules and regulations stemming from the initial framework now fill nearly 9,000 pages. Therefore, it shouldn't be surprising that Dodd-Frank has generated a firestorm of controversy (with plenty of fodder for politicians in both parties) and provided lively discussion during the recent presidential debates. Most relevant to our business at CircleUp, much of the controversy has centered on Dodd-Frank's impact on small banks and the small businesses to which they lend. More Headlines How Real Is the Jobs Recovery? Assessing 7 Criticisms of the U.S. Labor Market\nBuilding Wealth or Saving for Retirement While Preserving Values\nJobs Report Misses, But Solid Fundamentals Keep Labor Market on Track\nCalifornia Court Overrules an Unfair Finra Arbitration, Forcing Broker to Leave Black Mark on Record\nHow Finra Should Address One Way Shady Investment Firms Victimize Investors Twice\nThe criticism is typically two-fold: Dodd-Frank (1) provides an implicit taxpayer-funded subsidy to large banks by endorsing \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) institutions and (2) overburdens small community banks with costly regulations. If small businesses were to experience tighter access to credit as a result of this legislation, this would be a boon for crowdfunding platforms such as CircleUp. Facing higher interest rates from their customary lenders, small businesses might turn to crowdfunding investors rather than to community banks for growth capital. The reality, however, is that Dodd-Frank's impact on small banks and hence small businesses should be negligible. Here's why: 1. TBTF The lynchpin in the debate over Dodd-Frank's apparent endorsement of TBTF is the infrequently-discussed Orderly Liquidation Authority, or OLA. Dodd-Frank gives the federal government so-called \"resolution authority,\" which empowers the government to unwind failing financial institutions -- including those that have been labeled \"systemically important financial institutions\" (SIFIs) -- without resorting to ad-hoc taxpayer bailouts. Let's just hope that the world's brightest financiers, lawyers and politicians can give the OLA some teeth by establishing a systematic way to unwind an institution the size of, say, Citigroup (C) , which has total assets of nearly $2,000,000,000,000 (yes, 12 zeroes). Higher capital standards, more aggressive regulatory oversight and a credible way to be liquidated are by no means a favor to Wall Street banks. Admittedly, if liquidation remains an empty threat, then SIFI designation ensures that large Wall Street banks are indeed TBTF -- something with which even former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is uncomfortable. 2. High-Cost Regulation The criticism that Dodd-Frank increases costs for small banks by forcing them to meet cumbersome new regulatory standards is dubious. In reality, much of the new regulation imposed by Dodd-Frank is specifically targeted at bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets. For community banks, it is business as usual. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has admitted as much. \"I think it is important to emphasize that the vast majority of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act do not apply to community banks at all,\" Bernanke told reporters in September. Moreover, this message was reiterated in a recent Federal Reserve publication. 12"

Such losses will have an enormous impact on domestic expenditure.\" Haruhiko Kuroda, ADB president, said Asia was hit harder than other parts of the developing world because its markets have expanded more rapidly.\nThe ratio of financial assets to GDP rose to 370 percent of GDP in developing Asia in 2007 from 250 percent in 2003, the study said.\nIn comparison, Latin America's ratio only rose by modest 30 percent with the result that estimated losses on financial assets were a much lower $2.1 trillion, or 57 percent of GDP.\nBased on the study, the estimates measure the losses in equity and bond markets, including those based on mortgages and other assets, and the depreciations of currencies against the US dollar.\nThe estimates did not include financial derivatives such as credit default swaps that further multiplied the size of the financial markets.\nThe data provides clear proof of the close connections between the markets and economies around the world, leaving few, if any, countries immune to financial or economic fallouts elsewhere, the study said.\n\"This is by far the most serious crisis to hit the world economy since the Great Depression,\" Kuroda said at the opening of the two-day forum on the impact of global economic and financial crisis at the ADB headquarters in Manila.\nAnother ADB-commissioned study said South Asian countries could weather the financial crisis by taking both short- and long-term measures to stimulate their economies.\nThe subregion has been hit by capital outflows and weaker commodity prices, and faces a sharp slowdown in exports and remittances as global troubles worsen.\nThe ADB study suggested a number f measures to cushion the impact of the crisis, including rate reductions in India and Sri Lanka.\nIt also urged India and other countries in the subregion to consider incentives to encourage overseas workers to remit money home, such as special savings instruments and possible currency swap arrangements to keep financial systems stable.- Reuters Tags:\nFinancial crisis | global markets | More INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Stories"

        "webpage": "When a purchase involves both cash and stock, buyer and seller beware\nGuest Voices By SEAN SAARI\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Sean Saari is a senior manager in Skoda Minotti's Valuation and Litigation Advisory Services group. He focuses his practice in the areas of valuation, litigation advisory services, complex damages analysis and modeling, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic planning.\nWe are all familiar with the phrase \"cash is king.\" Why is it, though, that cash is crowned king and not real estate, bonds or LeBron James?It all boils down to the fact that everyone can agree to the value of a dollar bill without dispute  -  $1 is worth $1. Someone cannot reasonably argue that a dollar bill is really worth $1.10 or 90 cents.As a result, investors typically prefer to receive cash when selling an ownership interest in a business. It is not uncommon, however, for an acquirer to pay part of the purchase price of an acquisition with its own stock.In the case of a privately held acquirer, the value of its stock is somewhat subjective and there can be reasonable arguments for what one person perceives as being valued at $1 per share being worth 70 cents or $1.40. You get the idea. As a result, it is imperative that both the acquirer and the target in a transaction have support for, and a level of comfort with, the value assigned to the acquirer's shares if they are issued as part of the deal.There is risk on both sides of a transaction when a privately held company is issuing shares as a component of deal consideration. The buyer has an incentive to overvalue its stock and issue fewer shares to the seller, which results in the seller not receiving sufficient compensation for its company. The seller, on the other hand, has an incentive to undervalue the acquirer's stock in an effort to receive more shares and greater ownership percentage, which results in the buyer overpaying. As you can see, there are competing interests that can heighten the incentives for, and the likelihood of, overpayment or underpayment.Another factor that must be considered is that shares in a privately held company are typically subject to a meaningful lack of marketability discount, which may be greater than 30% of the acquiring company's undiscounted value. This discount takes into account the fact that a minority owner in a privately held company cannot readily turn his or her ownership interest into cash (unlike an investment in a publicly traded company). If this discount is not considered when assigning value to the acquirer's shares, it can result in the seller receiving less value than he or she would have had all of the proceeds been paid in cash.The impact of discounts for lack of marketability can extend to shares of publicly traded companies issued in connection with acquisitions as well. We have seen instances in which the sellers in a transaction received restricted stock of the publicly traded acquirer. The restrictions did not permit the sale of the shares for periods ranging from a few months to a few years, which makes the shares less valuable than they would be if they were freely tradable from day one. Imagine receiving shares of a publicly traded company worth $5 million on the date of issuance and watching them decline to $1 million prior to the restricted sale period elapsing. As a result, it is appropriate to consider a discount for lack of marketability for restricted shares in publicly traded companies, as well, to capture the risk associated with potential changes in the price of the acquiring company's shares before the restricted sale period has ended.While acquirers go to great lengths to reduce their risks when purchasing a company, it is still very much a \"buyer beware\" world  -  hence the amount of time spent on due diligence before a transaction closes. When shares of the acquiring company are being issued as a portion of the deal consideration in an acquisition, however, the seller also must beware. In these cases, it is essential that both the buyer and seller accurately value the acquirer's shares, or one party may be left with something worth far less than what it thought it bargained for."

They know that if they are to achieve this result, people throughout the company need to change their behavior and practices, and that can't happen by simple decree. How, then, does it happen? In the last few years, insights from neuroscience have begun to answer that question. New behaviors can be put in place, but only by reframing attitudes that are so entrenched that they are almost literally embedded in the physical pathways of employees' neurons. These beliefs have been reinforced over the years through everyday routines and hundreds of workplace conversations. They all have the same underlying theme: \"That's the way we do things around here.\"\nThis phrase (and others like it) typically refers to the complex, subtle practices that become ingrained in an organization's culture, to the point where they become part of its identity. Habitual thoughts and behaviors are not bad in themselves; indeed, they are often the basis for what a company does well. But when circumstances shift or the company becomes dysfunctional, those habits may need substantive change.\nWe teamed up to write this article, despite our disparate backgrounds  -  in neuroscience (Schwartz), learning and development in a major international corporation (Gaito), and ethics and leadership in the financial-services industry (Lennick)  -  because during the past six years, we each came to recognize the power of conceptual focus in organizational change. Altering habits is difficult enough for individuals. Studies suggest that the number of people who voluntarily shift away from addictive or obsessive-compulsive behavior, even when they know their lives are at stake, is staggeringly low, perhaps one in 10. At corporations, the complexity of collective behavior makes the challenge even greater. Furthermore, as with repairing a ship while it is at sea, these changes must be made at the same time that the company continues to operate.\nBut there is a particular type of highly charged conversational process that leads to changes in the neural patterns of people throughout an organization  -  a process that works with, not against, the predisposition and capability of the human brain.\nCargill's Strategy Transformation\nConsider, for example, the way that Cargill, a major agricultural and food products company, applied knowledge of the human brain to raise its game in collaboration and innovation across business units. Cargill had already undergone one major shift, starting in 1999, toward becoming a more agile, solutions-based organization. The company's executives had defined the \"heart of leadership\" for their company as integrity, conviction, and courage. They had also set out to create a \"culture of freedom,\" empowering and encouraging employees at every level to act with decisiveness and accountability on behalf of customers.\nBut some elements of the company's culture and practice still did not fully support the customer-focused culture that they were developing. One customer, a large packaged-foods manufacturer, told a Cargill executive, \"You send 15 different people to our offices each week from different businesses, and they all ask us some of the same questions, but they never try to understand exactly what we do with all of your ingredients. If you brought all those people together, you could potentially offer much more to us.\"\nThe situation clearly called for new behaviors. Better collaboration among Cargill employees, for example, would not just solve the problem of redundant sales calls. It could lead to new logistics, risk management, and quality assurance practices. But that type of collaboration, especially across Cargill's 70-plus businesses operating in 66 countries, would be a stretch  -  particularly since in Cargill's culture, it would require bottom-up commitment.\nPage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 | All | Next Last> E-Mail\nDouglas Lennick, Financial Intelligence: How to Make Smart, Values-Based Decisions with Your Money and Your Life (FPA Press, 2010): Similar reframing principles applied to personal finance.\nJeffrey Schwartz and Sharon Begley, The Mind and the  and the Power of Mental Force (Regan Books/HarperCollins, 2002): Explains how human thinking and behavior changes through processes like this one.\nJeffrey Schwartz and David Rock, \"The Neuroscience of Leadership,\" s+b, Summer 2006: How to develop far more effective leadership practices by taking the nature of the human brain into account.\nAdam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759): Smith's masterwork (as he considered it) explicates the development of morality through the \"impartial spectator\"; people building awareness of themselves in the context of a larger community.\nFor more thought leadership on this subject, visit the s+b website at: .\nThe Complexity of ComplexityBest Business Books 2014: Organizational CultureHow to Be Privileged Like Louis XIVMaking Sense of GlobalizationFree Your Strategy from Annual PlanningThe Untapped Value of Overseas Experience\nEnding the Battle between Leadership and ManagementThe New SupercompetitorsHow to Set Productive Collaboration into ActionThe Accountability Equation"

He accumulated figures on births, deaths, age of marriage and childbearing, and economic factors contributing to longevity. His main contribution was to highlight the relationship between food supply and population. Humans do not overpopulate to the point of starvation, he contended, only because people change their behavior in the face of economic incentives.\nNoting that while food production tends to increase arithmetically, population tends to increase naturally at a (faster) geometric rate, Malthus argued that it is no surprise that people thus choose to reduce (or \"check\") population growth. People can increase food production, Malthus thought, only by slow, difficult methods such as reclaiming unused land or intensive farming; but they can check population growth more effectively by marrying late, using contraceptives, emigrating, or, in more extreme circumstances, resorting to reduced health care, tolerating vicious social diseases or impoverished living conditions, warfare, or even infanticide. Malthus was fascinated not with the inevitability of human demise, but with why humans do not die off in the face of such overwhelming odds. As an economist, he studied responses to incentives.\nMalthus is arguably the most misunderstood and misrepresented economist of all time. The adjective \"Malthusian\" is used today to describe a pessimistic prediction of the lock-step demise of a humanity doomed to starvation via overpopulation. When his hypothesis was first stated in his best-selling An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798), the uproar it caused among noneconomists overshadowed the instant respect it inspired among his fellow economists. So irrefutable and simple was his illustrative side-by-side comparison of an arithmetic and a geometric series - food increases more slowly than population - that it was often taken out of context and highlighted as his main observation. The observation is, indeed, so stark that it is still easy to lose sight of Malthus's actual conclusion: that because humans have not all starved, economic choices must be at work, and it is the job of an economist to study those choices.\nMalthus addressed many other issues. His Principles of Political Economy (1820) was the first text to describe a demand schedule as separate from the quantity demanded at a given price. His exposition of demand curves clarified the debate on Say's law and gluts (to which he objected in the long run on the grounds that markets self-adjust). His work centered on contrasting the long run, as exemplified by population growth, with the short run, reflected by cyclical events such as those affecting agriculture. Writing before the industrial revolution, Malthus did not fully appreciate the impact of technology (i.e., pesticides, refrigeration, mechanized farm equipment, and increased crop yields) on food production.\nMalthus died in 1834, before seeing economics characterized as the \"dismal science.\" That phrase, coined by Thomas Carlyle in 1849 to demean John Stuart Mill, is often erroneously thought to refer to Malthus's contributions to the economics of population growth.\nAbout the Author Lauren F.

As relevant today as when it was first published over forty years ago, this newly updated edition of Galbraith's classic text on the 'economics of abundance', lays bare the hazards of individual and social complacency about economic inequality. Why worship work and productivity if many of the goods we produce are superfluous - artificial 'needs' created by high-pressure advertising? Why begrudge expenditure on vital public works while ignoring waste and extravagance in the private sector of the economy? Classical economics was born in a harsh world of mass poverty, and has left us with a set of preconceptions ill-adapted to the realities of our own richer age. And so, too often, 'the bland lead the bland'. Our unfamiliar problems need a new approach, and the reception given to this famous book has shown the value of its fresh, lively ideas. \"A compelling challenge to conventional thought\". (\"The New York Times\"). \"He shows himself a truly sensitive and civilized man, whose ideas are grounded in the common culture of the two continents, and may serve as a link between them; his book is of foremost importance for them both\". (\"The Times Literary Supplement\"). John Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006) was a Canadian-American economist. A Keynesian and an institutionalist, Galbraith was a leading proponent of 20th-century American liberalism and progressivism. Galbraith was the author of 30 books, including \"The Economics of Innocent Fraud\", \"The Great Crash: 1929\", and \"A History of Economics\".\n wisdom has it that John Kenneth Galbraith's The Affluent Society spawned the neoliberalism we see in Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, and other world leaders. The economist's prose, lofty but still easily manageable, laid down the gauntlet for the post-cold war class struggle that was still far in the future in 1958. Galbraith saw the widening gap between the richest and the poorest as an emergent threat to economic stability, and proposed significant investment in parks, transportation, education, and other public amenities--what we now call infrastructure--to ameliorate these differences and postpone depression and revolution indefinitely. Widely criticized by conservatives and libertarians wary of public expenditures or increased government influence, Galbraith still influences liberal and neoliberal thinking. He has acknowledged that his work, like that of most social scientists, contains flaws (like his dire prediction of an out-of-control unemployment and inflation spiral that petered out in the 1980's), but much of it remains fresh and true even today. Four years before Silent Spring, he wrote about the consumerist blight that threatened our wild lands equally as much as our cities; his hoped-for increase in environmental awareness has grown significantly in recent years. Whether you support the political implementations of his views, experiencing his writing is important to put those views in context. More than this, though, it is an honest pleasure to read such original ideas so well expressed. --Rob Lightner"

        "webpage": "Politics 16 March 2012 Should government reduce corporation tax to 20 per cent?\nMove may attract more capital to the country.\nBy New Statesman The government in the UK should reduce the corporate tax rate to the basic rate of income tax (20 per cent), suggests the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA).\nAs well as potentially attracting more capital to the country, the think tank believe that corporate tax rate reduction could help the government in simplifying the existing tax system, reducing taxes for investors, and removing an undesired change in business finance decisions. Pension funds, unit trusts, life insurance firms, investment trusts, and beneficiaries of investment funds may directly benefit.\nThe IEA claim that moves to reduce the corporate tax rate could avoid being a major fiscal burden on the country, and would not have any significant revenue implications.\nBy the end of 2014, the government will have reduced the rate of corporation tax from 26 per cent to 23 per cent. When compared with the basic rate of income tax, this still represents a tax bias against investment that could create number of problems.\nThe report cites a paper by the Independent Commission on Banking (ICB), which said that this tax bias causes companies to leverage more than they would if decisions were not distorted by the tax system.\nThe report claims that ultimately it is households, both in Britain and abroad, which pay corporation tax - but that it is hidden from them.\nPhilip Booth, editorial director of IEA, said:\nGiven the government's commitment to reducing the rate of corporate tax to 23 per cent by 2014, these proposals would not pose a major fiscal burden on the country. The government's own figures estimate that a 1 per cent reduction costs \u00a32.4bn, however this fails to take into account the increased investment.\nThis proposal would be an important step towards making a reality of the coalition government to give importance for the private sector to drive economic recovery.\nIn reality, this proposal may well be close to self financing. The proposals could partly be financed by reducing exemptions given to companies and they would bring about a much-needed simplification of the tax system."

Reapproaching the Fiscal Cliff\nIn the wake of the election, Washington seems likely to steer clear of the worst of the spending cuts and tax hikes.\nBy Milton Ezrati November 13, 2012 \u2022 Reprints\nNow that the political lines for the next couple of years are clear, the so-called fiscal cliff stands first on the agenda for President Obama and the existing Congress. The matter is urgent. Unless something is done between now and year-end, some $660 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax hikes will almost certainly toss the economy into recession.\nAvoiding it probably would have been easier with a Romney victory. By giving Congress an excuse to wait for the new administration to work out its budget, Romney would have offered both sides of the aisle a way to sidestep this difficult issue. But with Obama's reelection, the effort to avoid the cliff now requires hard negotiations. The next few weeks doubtless will see a lot of give-and-take and even with the initial spirit of compromise, recriminations, too. Because neither side can concede until the last minute, it's likely that little will become clear until late December. But it's nonetheless likely that in the end, Washington will steer clear of the cliff, or most of it, offering a kind of last-minute holiday gift to the economy and markets.\nDuring the coming period of negotiation and uncertainty, investors and business people need to keep in mind that no one in Washington wants to go off this cliff. Even before the election, Congress had voted to fund the government through March, indicating a clear willingness to at least kick the can down the road. What is more, a bipartisan group of eight senators, calling itself the \"Gang of Eight,\" was formed well before the election to devise at least a minimum down payment on the deficit that would forestall all the sequestration of discretionary spending, mostly on defense, something on which the 2011 debt ceiling compromise otherwise would have insisted. House Speaker John Boehner had already outlined the basis of a compromise on the Bush tax cuts. So this process began weeks ago. Still, some pieces of the cliff will be easier to level than others.\nThe easiest aspects to fix are the scheduled imposition of a broader-based alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the scheduled cutbacks in fees paid to doctors under Medicare and Medicaid. These issues amount to some $90 billion or about 14% of the cliff. Congress already has the legislation in place to avoid both. For several years now, it has passed special legislation to stop each from imposing fiscal restraint. The \"ATM patch,\" as it is called, regularly blocks this tax burden from spreading beyond the four million taxpayers who now suffer under it, to 32 million more. Its passage has become an annual event and a repeat should be easy to pass quickly in the closing weeks of the year. Similarly, Congress has so frequently sidestepped the mandated cut in doctors' fees that the legislation is known as the \"doc fix.\" Another round on this front should impose little problem.\nThe tax increases implicit in the Affordable Care Act stand at the other end of the difficulty scale and may be almost impossible to avoid. After all, such an effort could involve unwrapping that huge piece of complex legislation. These taxes include special Medicare levies on wealthier taxpayers and extending Medicare taxes to investment income. While those burdens may irritate investors, they amount to only $25 billion, less than 4% of the fiscal cliff."

The Act 47 coordinators told the state Department of Community and Economic Development in a letter Friday that the city has \"made great strides toward fiscal recovery.\" \"Pittsburgh has taken critical steps to address its legacy costs of pensions, retiree health care, worker's compensation, debt and capital needs,\" the letter says. Act 47 provides two state-appointed experts to help financially troubled municipalities develop plans to regain financial footing. Act 47 coordinator James H. Roberts said Wednesday he believes the Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, the other oversight agency, is still needed to oversee budgeting. The state declared Pittsburgh financially distressed in 2004 because of chronic budget deficits and debt payments that topped $90 million annually as well as unfunded pension liabilities of $375 million. The city has been required to submit budgets and five-year financial plans to the oversight agencies for approval. Roberts, a Downtown attorney, said the city needs continued ICA oversight of employee legacy costs estimated at nearly $1.5 billion and debt totaling $607 million. The city has knocked off $217 million from its debt principal since 2006. \"There's no question that continued long-term scrutiny of these things is required, but that's not a reason to keep Act 47 around,\" Roberts said. DCED spokesman Steve Kratz said department Secretary C. Alan Walker would decide whether to end Act 47 oversight after a public hearing and a review of a report submitted by Roberts and Managing Director Dean Kaplan. City Controller Michael Lamb said elimination of Act 47 oversight would be premature. He said revenue remains stagnant and infrastructure continues to suffer from years of budget cutting. \"I've always said I think this administration can use all the oversight that it can get, and I still feel that way,\" said Lamb, a likely candidate for mayor next year. Joanna Doven, spokeswoman for Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, called Lamb's statement \"political grandstanding.\" Ravenstahl said removal from oversight would improve the city's image and help it financially. \"This will send a strong message to the financial markets, I think, that Pittsburgh is back on its feet again,\" he said. ICA Chairman Dana Yealy promised a continued commitment in helping the city resolve its financial problems. In addition to a $1 billion pension liability, the city is responsible for $488.6 million in retiree health care costs for employees hired before 2005. \"The ICA also strongly agrees with Act 47 that the city still faces many challenges, including pension reform and long-term agreements with nonprofits,\" he said in a prepared statement. City Councilman Ricky Burgess, who chairs the finance committee, said he hopes the Act 47 coordinators' recommendation will prompt community leaders to lobby the Legislature for enactment of a payroll tax on Pittsburgh nonprofits. Tax-exempt nonprofits are paying the city $2.6 million in lieu of taxes this year toward the city's $460 million budget. Burgess said a payroll tax would permanently solve Pittsburgh's financial problems. \"This is now the opportunity for us to guide our own (financial) ship,\" he said. The Act 47 team created a financial recovery plan for Pittsburgh in 2004 and updated it in 2009. The plan scrutinized the city department by department and offered suggestions for cost-cutting, deficit and debt reduction, revenue enhancement and how to address union contracts and long-term employee pension and health care liabilities. Pittsburgh would become the seventh municipality to leave Act 47 oversight since the law took effect in 1987. Twenty-one municipalities in Pennsylvania remain under fiscal oversight. The state has spent about $4.6 million to fund the Act 47 team and $4.4 million on the ICA since 2004, according to Kratz. Bob Bauder is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.

        "webpage": "Stock Market Lookahead Stocks brace for fiscal cliff reckoning By Ben Rooney @ben_rooney The deadline to avert a looming fiscal crisis is fast approaching. Investors are hoping for the best, but bracing for the worst. Can the stock market shake off yet another punt by Congress? It just might. For weeks, many have worried that no resolution to the fiscal cliff would lead to the kind of brutal sell-off that followed the voting down of the TARP bailout and the downgrade of America's credit rating. Now, with the deadline fast approaching and no clear resolution in sight, strategists aren't so sure. \"I don't know how the market is going to react,\" said Ben Schwartz, chief market strategist at Lightspeed Financial. \"But I do know that people are upset with what's going on in Washington.\" The dysfunction in Washington has cast a pall over Wall Street since Election Day. But despite all the hand-wringing, stocks are currently trading at levels seen just before President Obama won a second term. So, where do stocks go from here? Good question. Much depends on what House lawmakers do Sunday, when they meet for a last-ditch round of budget talks. The hope is that a stopgap measure is put in place to prevent some of the tax hikes and spending cuts set to take effect on Jan. 1. Related: Going over the cliff: What changes, what doesn't Here are two possible outcomes: Partial deal, modest sell-off Like most Americans, investors view the budget impasse as an epic failure of leadership in Washington. But they still expect a deal, because doing nothing would be \"political suicide\" for members of both parties. \"We think they will reach some kind of agreement before the end of the year, but not until the very last minute. And it won't be much,\" said Kate Warne, chief investment strategist at Edward Jones. While the details remain sketchy, investors are expecting a short-term extension of Bush-era tax breaks and a suspension of defense spending cuts, among other things. Despite its name, many strategists say the fiscal cliff will not hit the economy right away. That could give lawmakers some time to continue negotiating, but it's unclear how long the market will tolerate such uncertainty. Related: Real fiscal cliff deadline is inauguration \"Unlike the debt ceiling and government shutdowns in the past, not all that much changes on January first,\" Warne said. \"But the tone will get more and more negative as time goes on.\" Even with a stopgap deal, stocks could sell off, according to Peter Tuz, a portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel. \"It doesn't have to be sharp,\" he said. \"A 20% drop would be astounding, but a modest drop would not be surprising.\" No deal, more volatility: Investors could be in for a rude awakening on New Year's day. Despite the political and economic stakes, it's not a given that Congress will act. \"I don't think investors have taken into account that nothing gets done,\" Warne said. Fiscal cliff jitters on the street Wall Street vigilantes believe a sell-off may be necessary to force America's elected officials into action. But there is no guarantee that a riot in the stock market will inspire sound policymaking. For example, the sell-off that followed the S&P downgrade did not result in a long-term solution to the debt ceiling problem, said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager with Federated Clover Investment Advisors. \"The market can act as a disciplinarian, but that doesn't ensure that we get a clean and lasting solution,\" Creatura said. \"We didn't get that last time, and it's probably not realistic to expect it this time either.\" The fiscal cliff was designed to force Washington to deal with the nation's long-term debt problems, but hopes for a grand bargain have diminished as talks devolved into stalemate. The lack of progress on structural issues, such as entitlement spending, means investors will be dealing with a certain degree of political risk long after the fiscal cliff deadline has passed. \"They're not dealing with the big issues,\" Tuz said. \"They'll come up with a band aid approach that just delays the inevitable.\" In the meantime, trading in the stock market could be volatile as investors monitor the blow-by-blow in Washington. The market's fear gauge, the VIX (VIX)has jumped in the last few days -- a sure sign that volatility is indeed on the rise. \"We're floating around here and no one has any real idea where we're going to go,\" Schwartz said. \"That's why volatility has popped up.\" CNNMoney (New York) December 31, 2012: 9:13 AM ET Comments Most Popular"

        "webpage": "Onlookers say fiscal cliff deal offers some encouragement to business owners\nBy Beth Fitzgerald,\nThe fiscal cliff deal struck in Congress raises income tax rates for single taxpayers making more than $400,000 and married couples earning above $450,000  -  and many of these wealthy taxpayers are small-businesses owners. But by putting an end to the uncertainty over future tax rates, the deal could encourage businesses to invest, expand and hire more workers, experts said.\nStill, there are new clouds on the horizon: in a few weeks, Congress is expected to embark on deficit reduction, with spending cuts that could dampen economic activity.\"With some stability, business owners can now make business decisions,\" said Alan D. Sobel, managing member of Sobel & Co., in Livingston. \"What really interferes with making decisions is uncertainty  -  people become paralyzed and sit on the sidelines. So my sense is that now that there is some element of certainty  -  at least, as it relates to income taxes  -  business owners are going to be freed up to be able to make decisions about investments in equipment, investments in people, in opening up new markets.\"David Brogan, first vice president of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, echoed that sentiment, saying the deal \"will create a level of certainty that is necessary for any economic rebound.\" He said keeping tax rate unchanged for singles earning less than $400,000 and couples earning less than $450,000 will mean a significant number of New Jersey small businesses won't see their taxes go up; President Barack Obama's original proposal  -  to raise taxes on incomes of more than $200,000 and $250,000, respectively  -  would have done far more damage in New Jersey, Brogan said.Brogan said businesses also will be helped by the move by Congress, as part of the fiscal cliff deal, to extend bonus deprecation, which had been set to expire at the end of 2012, for another year. This allows companies to write off 50 percent of the capital investment the first year.Bob Mathers, director in the tax department at Hunter Group CPA LLC, in Fair Lawn, said the extension of the bonus depreciation rule for one year is a direct boost to business. \"We now know what's going to happen for the next 12 months. We know if we need to spend money on equipment, that we can do that and get a direct writeoff without having to spread it out over several years,\" he said. \"When Congress comes back, there will still be a lot of talk about tax reform, but least we do have some certainty for the next 12 months.\"Many companies did resolve to move forward with their business plans last year  -  buying equipment or buildings, and hiring new workers  -  regardless of what happened in Washington. Some evidence of business confidence can be seen in Small Business Administration loan demand, which was strong in 2012, when New Jersey had its third-best SBA lending year on record, according to Al Titone, state district director for the SBA.\"People just couldn't wait any more,\" he said. \"You can only sit so long on the sidelines and then basically you jump in when you think you've got an opportunity.\"Anika Khan, senior economist of Wells Fargo, said the looming cliff led businesses to \"defer a lot of their spending activity due to uncertainty.\" But the deal reached by Congress doesn't restore clarity, she said, and the end of the payroll tax holiday affects all workers, and \"is going to cause household to pull back a bit on making some of their spending decisions.\"And in a few weeks, there will be budget cuts that will impact the economy, she added. \"Until businesses get completely clear about what the economic landscape is going to look like, and what their contribution is going to have to be, they are going to continue to be on the fence.\"Pat O'Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick, said when Congress takes up federal spending, \"the ripple will be significant.\"Lawmakers, he said, must address long-term cost increases in Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid. \"If that curve is not tilted downward or reduced gradually, it becomes highly disruptive,\" O'Keefe said. \"And the rancorous brinksmanship that has characterized fiscal and tax policy for the better part of a decade always runs the risk of a catastrophic event.\"\nBeth Fitzgerald\nBeth Fitzgerald reports on health care, small business and higher education.

        "webpage": "Free Markets Are a Woman's Best Friend\nSteven Horwitz\nCapitalism is frequently blamed for many things it isn't responsible for. This is simply a reality we defenders of free markets have learned to live with.\nAmong the accusations made against capitalism is that it is bad for women. A couple of weeks ago I discussed the gender wage gap, which is often claimed as an example of how capitalism causes discrimination against women. We hear other arguments about how it supports \"patriarchy\" and otherwise leads to women being treated as second-class citizens. In fact capitalism has done far more good for women than bad.\nOne of the best examples is the way capitalism has made possible women's economic advancement, particularly their increased presence in the labor force. The steady increase in women's labor force participation is perhaps the most important demographic fact of the last 100 years. By giving women their own source of income, capitalism has empowered them in a number of ways; for example, the changing dynamics of marriage has enabled women to get out of relationships they previously could not have left. Women's economic independence has transformed the family in other ways as well.\nWe can look at women's increased labor force participation from two sides, as we often do in economics. Capitalism both demanded more female labor and supplied the conditions that made it easier for women to provide it.\nRising Demand\nThe demand side is perhaps more obvious. The economic growth that capitalism generated after the Industrial Revolution and into the early twentieth century had two consequences. First, it increased the demand for labor in general. As wages rose and workers (mostly men) grew wealthier, they began to buy more than before. That rising demand for final goods increased the demand for all the inputs that went into them. Of course one of those inputs is labor.\nThis increased demand for labor meant that firms had to find workers somewhere. One option was to try to bid men away from other jobs, but the only way to do that was to pay higher wages. The other option was to hire more women in jobs that had previously been restricted to men. In fact this is what many firms started to do early last century. The result was that women who had not worked outside the home before began to get jobs. The growth driven by capitalism and industrialization made this possible.\nGrowth had a second effect on the demand for female labor. As industrialization progressed and the scale of operations grew, the number of ancillary jobs such as secretaries and clerks grew. In addition, part of the increase in consumer demand noted above was for services rather than goods. Instead of buying a chicken and butchering it themselves, people were willing to pay more for chicken parts. Eating out became more common, and the demand for personal services such as barbers and hair stylists grew. Women could compete against men for many of these clerical and service jobs more effectively than they could for harder physical labor. The result was more job opportunities for women. By the 1940s the demand for female labor was intense enough that firms started to offer the option of part-time work to meet married women's need for flexibility.\nDomestic Labor-Saving Devices\nCapitalism also supplied the conditions that made it easier for women to supply this labor. The biggest problem married women, especially with kids, faced if they wanted to work was caring for the household. With the technology available at the turn of the last century, keeping a home clean was a fulltime job. The interwar era, however, saw the development of all kinds of new household appliances that significantly reduced the time required to clean and cook. Doing the laundry went from a three-day, multi-person job to just a matter of hours. These inventions liberated women from much of the drudgery of housework and made it at least thinkable to work outside of the home. (This point is powerfully presented in this Hans Rosling video.)\nWomen were also becoming increasingly educated, both at the high school and college level. Here too the wealth created by capitalism made it possible for families to afford to educate their children longer, including their daughters. This wealth was also sufficient to make children's income unnecessary for survival. The more-educated and more-productive potential female workforce meant that it was more likely women would get hired.\nAlthough it rarely gets the credit, capitalism liberated women from centuries of second-class citizenship.\nSteven Horwitz is the Charles A. Dana Professor of Economics at St. Lawrence University and the author of Hayek's Modern Family: Classical Liberalism and the Evolution of Social Institutions.

Schnatter Institute for Entrepreneurship and Free Enterprise at Ball State University.\nHe is a member of the FEE Faculty Network.\nHow Does Trade Create Wealth?\nTrading results in mutual gain.

In Britain, top banks are being encouraged to tap some of their excess liquidity to lend out and aid economic recovery.\nThere was, however, a liquidity shortfall of 225 billion euros among the remaining 128 smaller, more domestically-focused banks in the sample of 170 lenders studied by the EBA.\nA third element of Basel is a leverage ratio set at 3 percent from 2018, meaning banks must hold capital equivalent to at least 3 percent of their total non risk-weighted assets.\nIt is meant to serve as a simple backstop in case banks have incorrectly added up their risk weightings to calculate core buffers. Regulators in Britain have been pushing hard for UK banks to meet this target as soon as they can.\nThe EBA said that by December last year, the average leverage ratio for 40 large banks it surveyed was 2.9 percent, with 58 percent of them reaching 3 percent.\nThe combined capital shortfall of those top banks that do not meet the 3 percent target was 106.6 billion euros, the watchdog said.\nThe EBA and the European Central Bank will carry out a health check of banks across the European Union later this year which is expected to show shortfalls in capital that will have to be plugged.\n(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Pravin Char)"

Hohman, published on March 12, 2008\nNew figures released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that Michigan is again the national leader in job loss and unemployment rate. Michigan lost 1.5 percent of its employment from 2006 to 2007. The state's unemployment rate went up from 6.9 percent in 2006 to 7.2 percent in 2007, the highest average annual rate the state has seen since 1993. The state's current 7.1 percent unemployment rate is the highest in the nation.\nMichigan also started off 2008 by shedding an additional 3,900 nonfarm jobs, although that change was not statistically significant, according to the BLS, and the state unemployment rate dipped from a high of 7.4 percent. Stay Engaged Receive our weekly emails! email address Since 2002, Michigan has lost 5 percent of its total nonfarm employment. Overall, national employment over the same period increased 6 percent. The only other state to lose jobs over this period was Ohio, which lost 0.4 percent of its employment. Michigan's decline has been deep and broad. Since 2002, Michigan lost 19 percent of its manufacturing jobs, 17 percent of its construction jobs, 12 percent of its natural resources and mining jobs, 11 percent of its information jobs, and lesser losses in financial activities, professional and business services and government. However, the auto workers that remain appear to have growing wages. Between 2001 and 2006, average wages at auto manufacturing plants increased by 27 percent, according to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. Compensation is now over $88,000 annually. These figures do not include benefits packages. Michigan policymakers are largely abstaining from implementing policies that would improve Michigan's situation. Lansing is currently discussing how to promote fringe industries in alternative energy, and reregulating Michigan's electricity generation. Not only do such diversions ignore the fundamental problems Michigan faces, but they take policy further away from a competitive market.\nThere is one area where pending legislation could improve Michigan's business structure. A bill introduced by State Rep. David Agema, R-Grandville, would prevent the Department of Environmental Quality from\nenacting environmental rules that are more stringent than federal policies. This would decrease the regulatory burden on businesses while maintaining safety measures that meet federal guidelines. But what's lacking in Lansing is a serious discussion of labor and tax reforms that would improve Michigan's economy and help deliver it from the current stagnation. We can no longer afford arguments for the status quo that might benefit one group at the expense of the state as a whole. The state should consider a\nright-to-work law and eliminate one of Michigan's major taxes  -  sales, income or business  -  if it wants to reverse its precipitous economic decline. Unless there is transformational change in Lansing, we can expect further depressing numbers from the BLS.\nJames M.

        "webpage": "WASHINGTON  -  Ontario is about to introduce a bill allowing it to retaliate against any state that adopts Buy American provisions, then plans to start a national conversation with other provinces about measures to punish new cases of procurement protectionism.\n\nPremier Kathleen Wynne shared details of the move in an interview with The Canadian Press.\n\nShe said her cabinet has examined legislation to be tabled when the legislature reconvenes later this month. The planned bill would reduce procurement opportunities for states that adopt Buy American provisions, by allowing provincial officials to write regulations targeting individual states.\n\nWynne insisted the size of each punishment will be proportional to the size of the Buy American exclusion  -  no more because, she says, she wants to avoid triggering an escalating tit-for-tat that damages the economy.\n\n\"I don't want a trade war,\" Wynne said after a visit to Washington.\n\n\"But we have to stand up for Ontario businesses, and Ontario workers, and do that in a proportional way. ... We are not going to roll over.\"\n\nWynne said the move was inspired by a recent infrastructure bill from the state of New York.\n\nThe Canadian federal government is aware of her plans, she said. Next she intends to discuss the idea with other Canadian premiers at their upcoming conference: \"I'll certainly be raising it.\"\n\nOne Canada-U.S. trade expert based in Toronto said the move might not be as dramatic as it sounds. The reason: Ontario procurement already has numerous limits to competition, and is far more protectionist than advertised by its politicians.\n\n\"Offence sometimes can be good defence, but in this case Ontario government procurement markets may not be as open now as this suggests,\" said Mark Warner of MAAW Law.\n\n\"At the end of the day, state and procurement preferences in a revised NAFTA will have to be negotiated as we did in response to the (2009 U.S. stimulus bill) ... and partially in (the Canadian-European trade agreement).\"\n\nDespite the procurement threat, Wynne said she leaves Washington more optimistic about the state of trade between the U.S. and Canada.\n\nShe met with American lawmakers, business, and with the chief U.S. NAFTA negotiator, John Melle. She said every person she met had a positive attitude about finding common ground in the NAFTA negotiations.\n\n\"Nobody said there's no path for a solution here,\" she said.\n\n\"Generally I'm feeling better than I was in November. ... Not in one of my meetings did I hear, 'We should blow the thing up.' ... I feel very encouraged. People are engaged and they think there's a reason to stay engaged.\"\n\nCase in point: auto rules of origin.\n\nWhile the U.S. criticized a Canadian suggestion at the last round of talks it appears not to be a total rejection. She said the U.S. appears to want more concrete details from Canada, with numbers, about how its proposal would work.\n\nThe Canadians floated a general idea of reforming the formula for what counts as a North American car  -  it would count all costs to manufacturers, not just hard materials, but also include research-and-development and intellectual property.\n\nIt's seen as a less dramatic change than an earlier U.S. proposal. But Canada did not provide specific numbers. The U.S. trade czar at the last round complained that, depending on how this approach were applied, it could result in cars with mostly Asian parts counting as North American.\n\nBut the conversation isn't stalled, apparently.\n\n\"What I heard from Melle was: 'We've got to have more specificity,\"' Wynne said."

        "webpage": "The Evidence-Based Investor\nWhy the investing industry loves complexity\nPosted by Robin Powell on October 26, 2015 I was contacted the other day by a company asking if The Evidence-Based Investor would like to feature some research it had done into a new system of investing which it plans to bring to market. I was happy to take a look but I barely made it past the first paragraph.\nThe blurb I was sent was so complicated and so full of industry jargon that it had me completely lost. I wish the firm well and, hey, it may even be on to something, but this experience epitomises for me one of the biggest problems with the investing industry today.\nInvestment professionals love complexity. That, combined with a lack of investor education, is how they make their profits. As a former Goldman Sachs money manager once revealed, \"The quickest way to make money on Wall Street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client.\"\nWe already have far more investment products than we actually need. There are now upwards of 77,000 mutual funds to choose from worldwide  -  that's more funds than individual stocks. Competition is hotting up in the ETF sector to produce the most obscure and complicated product imaginable; and despite the ever-mounting evidence that investing in hedge funds is a sure-fire way of losing money, the rate at which new hedge funds are being launched is actually accelerating.\nOf course, all these new funds need explaining and evaluating, hence the need for armies of consultants to advise institutional investors. This proliferation of products also helps to explain why, at a time when most of the journalism industry has contracted, the financial media has grown.\nBut although it's the industry's friend, complexity is usually the investor's foe, as Ben Carlson explains so eloquently in his excellent new book, A Wealth of Common Sense: Why Simplicity Trumps Complexity in Any Investment Plan.\n\"As the number of investment options available to investors continues to increase there is the assumption that complex approaches must be better,\" says Carlson. \"In fact.. less is always more and trying to implement a more interesting or clever portfolio strategy is akin to threading the needle. Sure, it can work, but trying harder and increasing the number of decisions you make only increases the odds that you'll make a mistake.\"\nYes, the financial markets are hugely complex  -  far more complex in fact than many investment professionals realise  -  but a complex portfolio is not the answer. On the contrary, the simpler and more low-maintenance your strategy is the better. In investing, simplicity really is the ultimate sophistication.\nBut Carlson goes on to explain how, counter-intuitively, it's actually easier (as well as commercially beneficial) for the investing industry to maintain its culture of complexity. As Nassim Taleb explains in his book Antifragile:\n\"A complex system, contrary to what people believe, does not require complicated systems and regulations and intricate policies.. Yet simplicity has been difficult to implement in modern life because it is against the spirit of a certain brand of people who seek sophistication so they can justify their profession.\"\nLike fund managers, consultants and financial journalists, another group of professionals who might feel threatened by the growing trend in global investing towards greater simplicity are financial advisers. I've heard some advisers say the reason they won't adopt a simple, transparent, evidence-based investing philosophy is that they're worried their clients would refuse to pay them as much if they did.\nBut that completely misses the point. Picking funds is a very small part of proper financial planning, and continually moving clients' money from one fund to another has nothing to do with it at all. Also, despite being simple, investing is not easy. There is a difference. Most of us need a financial adviser to keep us on track through thick and thin, to point out our emotional biases and to protect us from those self-destructive tendencies that all investors are prone to.\nYes, the industry is gradually moving towards lower costs, greater transparency and much more simple investment portfolios, but good financial advice is as valuable as it's ever been.\nThe future belongs to advisers who embrace simplicity. It's those who try to blind investors with complexity who should be worried.\nRobin Powell\nA journalist and broadcaster, Robin Powell is a campaigner for positive change in the investing industry.

But it keeps fiddling with how to express that commitment. Another shift in that communications strategy is set to occur when the central bank's interest-rate-setting committee gathers for two days of talks on Tuesday and Wednesday, as it's the first meeting to be led by Janet Yellen, the new chairwoman. The Fed will release a policy statement and updated economic forecasts at 2 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, and Yellen will hold a press conference at the end of the deliberations at 2:30 p.m. Also read: Fed transparency boils down to 16 dots on a page With the Fed and the markets basically on the same page on the economy, the current near-zero interest-rate policy, and the rate of reduction in bond purchases, the central bank has an opportunity to revamp its forward guidance tool, now the chief policy instrument. \"They've got a little room to unanchor these things,\" said Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. So-called forward guidance attempts to drive down long-term rates by promising to keep short-term rates low for a long time. The Fed has reworded its pledge throughout the financial crisis. Alexander said the early forms of forward guidance were simpler as the Fed was simply saying that it was a long way from raising rates. See interactive timeline of Fed's forward guidance. The Fed's current pledge is to hold rates steady until \"well past\" the point when the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%. But the unemployment rate has steadily dropped over the past year, before ticking up slightly to 6.7% in February. \"It is time to seriously rethink that 6.5% unemployment target because we are so close to it,\" said former Fed governor Randall Kroszner in an interview with MarketWatch. Yellen has signaled that she would be comfortable with this change, analysts said, when she told lawmakers last month that the unemployment rate did not fully summarize the health of the labor market. Experts don't think the Fed will simply lower the threshold to a 6% unemployment rate. Instead, the prevailing view is the Fed will move to a more \"holistic\" description of labor-market activity. The new guidance is likely to be \"be less specific and more ambiguous and point to a variety of indicators,\" said Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at Payden & Rygel in Los Angeles. It's not the only item on the Fed's agenda. Another focus will be on the Fed's growth, inflation and interest-rate forecasts. \"The words won't matter much,\" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, in an interview. \"The market will look at the Fed's projections.\" The market now expects the fed funds rate to be 0.6% by the end of 2015, implying one rate hike. This is close to the Fed's own projection, Alexander said. Economists expect the Fed's forward guidance to be tested once the weather impact clears. Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee late last month that it is \"difficult to discern exactly how much\" bad weather was obscuring the economic outlook. Yellen says 'adverse' weather has hurt spending(0:42)\nTestifying before the Senate Banking Committee in late February, Janet Yellen said the heavy snowfalls across much of the United States this winter had \"adversely\" affected consumer spending levels.\nIf the economy snaps back in the second quarter, market participants will likely pull forward the anticipated date of the first policy tightening into earlier in 2015, Alexander said. \"There is no doubt the market will test the Fed,\" said Robin. Payden & Rygel's Cleveland said that if markets started to price in an earlier tightening, the Fed might be forced to be more specific with its guidance. The timing of the first rate hike in mid-2015 appears to be the \"line in the sand,\" he said. So, for the time being, he said, the Fed \"can use words.\" As for the Fed's bond-purchase program, it's barely in the spotlight after dominating the agenda for so much of last year. Despite generally weak data since its last meeting in January, the central bank is widely expected to continue to reduce the pace of its monthly asset purchases by a further $10 billion, to a rate of $55 billion a month. \"Tapering is clearly on tap,\" said Alexander. This would be the third straight Fed policy meeting with a gradual reduction in the pace of purchases. Analysts expect the slow reduction to continue until the program is fully wound down, at the end of the third quarter. Only a shock to the economy would cause the Fed to change course, analysts said.

        "webpage": "Obama decides not to extend term of jobs council\nBy JOSH LEDERMANAssociated Press\nGeneral Electric Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt listens at right as President Barack Obama meets with the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. WASHINGTON, D.C.  -  President Barack Obama is letting his jobs council expire, cutting off one source of input from business leaders while unemployment remains stubbornly high.\nObama formed the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in January 2011, when unemployment was about 9 percent. It's now 7.8 percent, though more than 12 million people are out of work.\nObama's executive order establishing the council said it would go out of business Jan. 31, 2013. The White House said Thursday that Obama had no plans to renew its charter.\n\"The work of the jobs council was very valuable,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \"While the president didn't agree with all of its recommendations, he agreed with many of them and acted on a number of them.\"\nWhite House officials said Obama intended for the council to fulfill its mission and then wind down, and that he would seek input about the economy from business leaders in other ways. Among the steps Obama plans to pursue are expedited permits for public works projects, plus programs to boost entrepreneurship and workforce development.\nEven before Obama's decision was clear, Republicans seized on the council's likely expiration as evidence the president hadn't spent enough time on trying to create jobs, which is a priority for Americans. The Republican National Committee called it part of \"the failed Obama record,\" while the House Republicans' campaign committee, in an online petition, accused Obama of laying off his own jobs council.\nAdding to the concern about the job market's vulnerability, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December of last year, the first quarterly drop since 2009. The Federal Reserve said the economy appears to have \"paused in recent months.\"\nThe jobs council was a successor to an economic advisory board Obama created at the onset of his presidency. The panel was chaired by General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt and included prominent business leaders and economists. Immelt said Thursday that progress has been made on putting in place 90 percent of the council's recommendations.\nObama met with the council only a few times. During the last meeting, in February 2012, the president and the council highlighted an engineering education initiative alongside school deans.\n\"The president treated his jobs council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nThe council's main product was a report, \"Roadmap to Renewal,\" that was released in January 2012. The council also organized a series of meetings across the country last year with business owners, elected officials and academics; Obama didn't attend those election-year sessions.\nCritics have argued that the council's primary purpose was to create the appearance of action at a time when the nation was pining for something to rein in soaring joblessness. The administration acted on many of the council's recommendations, including suggestions to streamline permitting and small business loans, increase tourist visas and boost energy efficiency.\nBut the White House was at odds with several council members on tax policies, particularly a proposal to exclude overseas corporate earnings from U.S. taxes. That idea divided even the jobs council, whose membership included labor and Obama's political allies.\n\"It was helpful in terms of putting a spotlight on a variety of issues, but particularly helpful in the area of entrepreneurship,\" said AOL co-founder Steve Case, a member of the panel, in an interview. \"There's still work to be done, but we did make good progress.\"\nThe council's dissolution also comes as White House aides are optimistic about the prospects for a second-term detente with business.\nDuring Obama's first term, business leaders bristled at his harsh depiction of \"fat-cat bankers\" and his efforts to impose regulations, tax policies and spending initiatives they argued were unfriendly to business. Obama aides hope the warming of ties between the president and the business world can benefit the White House in future fiscal debates with Republicans.\nWhite House officials said the president made a fresh effort to reach out to business in the days following his re-election. Between the November election and the end of 2012, in the height of negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff,\" more than 400 business leaders, ranging from CEOs of large multinational companies to small business owners, met with Obama or his aides at the White House, officials said."

        "webpage": "Management Insights\nWhen Local Governments' Pensions Are Beyond Their Control\nMany cities and counties are tied to state pension systems. That can be a liability, but it also can be an asset.\nby Susan K. Urahn\nSusan K. Urahn\nExecutive vice president and chief program officer for the Pew Charitable Trusts\nConnect with Susan It might come as a surprise to some, given the drumbeat of reports about underfunded public pensions, that a number of states and localities boast retirement systems that consistently perform well: In North Carolina and Milwaukee, for example, policymakers paid their pension bills when they came due and raised benefits only after determining how to pay for them.\nUnfortunately, however, there are all too many examples of governments that continue to struggle to cover the long-term costs of their employees' pensions. Some of the challenges facing these retirement systems can be traced to the collapse of pension investments during the recent financial crisis, but states and local governments that are in the worst shape had pension problems that preceded the Great Recession. Their retirement systems are deep in the red because of poor policy choices--not just a weak economy.\nWant more management news and commentary? Click here.\nPublic Pensions and the Lessons of Success\nHow a Transit Workers' Pension Plan Jumped the Tracks\nThe Reforms That Public Pensions Really Need\nA Not-So-Public Pension's Disappearing Money\nCities and the Fiscal Challenge of Retiree Health Care\nOne aspect of this important issue is often overlooked: the connection between state pension policy and local government. Many cities and counties are tethered to the rules, administration and financing of their states' pension systems. When states get in trouble, local governments can end up having to cover the costs of decisions beyond their control. The reverse is also true: A state can help its local governments by enacting sound pension policies. Examples from Illinois and Kentucky illustrate both aspects of this situation.\nIn Illinois, the pensions of most cities are managed by the state-administered Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund. The state fund sets rules and imposes fiscal discipline on participating employers. In 2009, it had 83 percent of the money needed to cover its long-term pension obligations. While Illinois was failing at managing its own state pensions, the rules it set for IMRF kept that system in relatively good shape.\nChicago, however, is not part of this fund, and is weighed down with a retirement system that imposes runaway costs on the city's budget. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, noting that cost-of-living adjustments allowed by the plan exceed the city's ability to pay, proposed a 10-year freeze on these COLAs. But because Chicago cannot act without state approval--and Illinois lawmakers have so far avoided voting on Chicago's reforms--the city's unfunded pension liabilities are going from bad to worse.\nA different, and far more positive, scenario took place in Louisville, Ky., where city employees participate in a state-run retirement plan. Louisville's unfunded liability has continued to grow, even though the city made 100 percent or more of its recommended pension contributions each year. These shortfalls were primarily the result of investment losses and unfunded cost-of-living adjustments awarded by the state.\nWith pension costs eating up 15 percent of the city's general fund, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer had to rely on state legislators to tackle Kentucky's pension challenges. And during the last legislative session, policymakers did just that, passing a bipartisan set of reforms that is projected to save more than $10 billion for Kentucky and its local governments over the next 20 years while keeping the promises made to public employees and retirees.\nKentucky is moving forward with three key reforms. First, the law commits Kentucky to paying the full amount owed into the pension system and includes a funding plan that makes nearly $100 million available each year to help meet this promise. Second, Kentucky will limit future cost-of-living adjustments unless the benefit can be fully paid for; this reform essentially ends an unfunded mandate on Louisville and other municipalities across the state. And third, employees hired after Jan. 1 of next year will be placed into a hybrid cash-balance retirement plan that will make costs more predictable and easier to budget for.\nThere are no simple answers for the challenges facing public pensions. State and local leaders must work together to craft fair, data-driven solutions. This will require tough choices but, as some states have shown, with collaboration and a willingness to face up to the challenge there are solutions to the problem of underfunded public pensions.\n| Contributor\n\n| @pewstates\nMore from Management Insights\nConnect with Susan MOST READ\nSome state and local retirement systems have found a formula for stability."

        "webpage": "An American Perspective on the U.K. Financial Services Authority: Politics, Goals & Regulatory Intensity\nHowell E. Jackson Harvard Law School\nHarvard Law and Economics Discussion Paper No. 522 Abstract: Although similarities between the British and American systems of financial regulation are often remarked upon in academic commentary, the organizational structure of financial supervision in the two countries has diverged substantially in the past decade, as the United Kingdom has now largely consolidated its financial regulatory agencies in the Financial Services Authority whereas the United States has maintained the world's most decentralized and fragmented collection of financial supervisory agencies. In this essay, Professor Howell Jackson explores various reasons why financial regulation in these two countries differs so dramatically in organizational structure. Focusing first on the differences in political economy that surrounded the enactment of the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 in the United Kingdom and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 in the United States, Professor Jackson discusses deeper differences in the regulatory philosophies of the two countries and also presents data on the relative intensity of financial regulation in both jurisdictions. He speculates that the comparatively more ambitious regulatory agenda of the U.S. system pushes the country towards a more elaborate system of financial oversight that is inherently more difficult to consolidate. In the United Kingdom, in contrast, the goals of the financial regulators are more modest and, to the extent that cost efficiency is one of the country's regulatory objectives in the field of financial regulation, that policy tends to foster a less cumbersome system of financial regulation that more easily accommodates consolidation of regulatory functions. The paper concludes with some broader comparative data suggesting that while British financial regulation may be less intensive than financial regulation in the United States, it is substantially more intensive than financial regulation in many other jurisdictions, particularly civil law jurisdictions on the Continent.

        "webpage": "U.S. and Europe kick off free trade talks By Mark Thompson @MarkThompsonCNN President Obama and EU leaders used a G8 meeting in Northern Ireland to announce the start of talks on what they hope will be an historic transatlantic free trade deal. The U.S. and Europe announced the start of negotiations on a transatlantic trade and investment pact, which has the potential to add about $420 billion a year to the global economy. Under pressure to find new ways of stimulating demand to end recession in Europe, accelerate sluggish growth in the U.S. and bring down unemployment, President Obama and EU leaders said much was achieved in starting formal talks but plenty of hard work lay ahead. \"It's a testament to the leadership and political will of everyone here that we've reached this point,\" said U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron. \"We must maintain that political will in the months ahead -- this is a once in a generation prize and we're determined to seize it.\" The announcement came at a meeting of the leaders of the G-8 -- the world's leading developed economies -- in Northern Ireland. The U.S. will host the first round of negotiations in Washington next month. A comprehensive EU-U.S. trade deal would be the biggest of its kind and could add $160 billion to annual European income, $125 billion to U.S. income and $133 billion to other economies. Together, the U.S. and EU account for about half of global economic output, and trade some $1 trillion in goods and services each year, supporting about 13 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. A free trade deal could create as many as two million new jobs at a time when southern Europe is blighted by record unemployment and the U.S. is struggling to create enough new positions to bring its own jobless rate down significantly. Related: Steel fight adds to EU-China trade tension Plans to announce the start of negotiations were nearly derailed last week when France insisted that movies and music be excluded from the discussions, fearing U.S. media could overrun French-language products. EU officials hammered out a compromise, which takes the audio-visual services industry off the table for now but lets the European Commission seek to broaden its negotiating mandate once talks are underway. But the spat shows how tricky the talks will be. Other thorny topics are likely to include agriculture, aviation and public sector contracts. Officials hope the talks will be completed in 18 months to two years but insist a deal won't be rushed for the sake of it. Obama said the bid for a transatlantic deal enjoyed broad support in Congress and the business community, and he was hopeful that a comprehensive agreement was within reach. \"It is important that we get it right, and that means resisting temptation to downsize our ambition or avoid tough issues just for the sake of getting a deal,\" he added. The new transatlantic push comes as Europe's trading relationship with China -- its second biggest partner after the U.S. -- grows increasingly tense following a series of disputes.

It is vital that this proposal is adopted in full to ensure the financial sector contributes its fair share to the costs of the crisis, which is hurting hundreds of millions around the world.\n\"The elephant in the room is how the money will be spent - for the FTT to be a 'Robin Hood tax', EU leaders must commit a significant portion of its revenues to be used to fight poverty at home and abroad and tackle climate change.\"\n\"Countries which have not yet joined the pioneering EU group need to explain to their voters why they are against a tax on speculators that will raise billions and is designed to protect the real economy.\"\nThe introduction of an 'issuance principle' ensures that financial institutions located outside the group of 11 countries would also be obliged to pay the FTT if they traded securities originally issued within the 11 countries.\nThe proposed Financial Transaction Tax will fall predominantly on speculators as the EC proposal exempts the first issuances of shares and bonds - that are an important instrument for businesses to raise funding from financial markets - as well as exclude mergers and acquisitions from the tax, allowing companies to restructure without paying the tax. European consumers will not feel a significant additional tax burden, as mortgages, consumer credit and insurance contracts are not included in the tax.\nDespite the request by some MEPs and some Member States to exempt pension funds, Commissioner Semeta stood strong and refused to introduce any major exemption that would have reduced the revenues raised by the tax and its effect on speculation.\nThe directive is broader than the several unilateral FTTs agreed in France, and planned in Spain, Portugal and Italy. The Directive broadens these taxes to include a wider range of financial markets including shares, bonds and derivatives, and will replace the national FTTs when it is ultimately implemented.\nThe Commission estimates that the FTT by 11 countries could raise \u20ac31bn. Recent research by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) estimated the potential revenues at \u20ac37bn a year.\nContact information: For more information, please contact Gaelle Bausson on +32 473 562 260 or at \nJoin the Robin Hood Tax Campaign"

Photo Credit: iStockPhoto advertisement | advertise on newsday\nIn the 1960s, Woody Allen bemoaned the fact that it was impossible to get a divorce in New York unless one spouse could prove the other's infidelity. \"The Ten Commandments say, 'Thou shalt not commit adultery,' \" Allen quipped. \"But New York State says you have to.\" A similar contradiction plagues American policy on disability.\nThe Americans With Disabilities Act, passed with bipartisan support in 1990 at the urging of then-President George H.W. Bush, enshrines the notion that every American can and should hold a job regardless of physical or mental limitations. Employers who refuse to hire or promote the disabled may be liable in federal court.\nEditorial: What was Donald Trump thinking?\nO'Reilly: I can't be a Republican any more\nFiscina: Only Chelsea Clinton can do this for Hillary Social Security Disability Insurance, however, pays people who can show that they are too mentally or physically impaired to remain in the labor force. In short, for many workers, it creates a quasi-right not to work.\nThis paradox is getting expensive. Social Security Disability Insurance spending has doubled as a percentage of gross domestic product in the last 25 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The program paid $128.9 billion to 8.3 million beneficiaries in fiscal 2011, about one-fifth of all Social Security spending. The average monthly benefit is $1,100, slightly less than the average Social Security retirement check, but after two years on SSDI, beneficiaries also get Medicare. Indeed, the program added $80 billion to the cost of Medicare in fiscal 2011.\nThe disability trust fund, financed by a portion of the Social Security payroll tax, is set to run out of cash by 2016, though the government will undoubtedly borrow to meet its obligations.\nWhat's going on? Work hasn't gotten more physically demanding; quite the contrary. And there's no evidence that workers in general are substantially less healthy than they used to be.\nThe answers lie in the disability insurance program's haphazard history. When adopted in 1956, the program applied only to workers older than 50 who were terminally ill or unable to work for the rest of their lives. It was essentially an early-retirement program for people with cancer, heart disease and other grave physical conditions.\nIn 1960, however, Congress removed the minimum age requirement, and in 1965, it allowed people to qualify if they suffered from a condition rendering them unable to \"engage in substantial gainful activity\" for a year or more, including mental and musculoskeletal ailments.\nAfter that, the rolls swelled with people claiming crippling back aches and depression. Both the Carter and Reagan administrations tried to cull undeserving cases, but the resulting backlash was so strong that Congress actually liberalized the rules in 1984. In 2010, mental and musculoskeletal conditions accounted for 54 percent of all new cases.\nThough Washington pays benefits, states help decide who qualifies. And applications spike during serious recessions, as laid-off workers turn to disability when unemployment benefits run out. Thanks to the Great Recession, applications spiked in 2010 to an all-time high of 2.94 million, before declining slightly last year.\nThis isn't to imply that all, or even most, beneficiaries are malingering. Indeed, some of the recent increase in enrollment would've occurred anyway due to the aging of the population.\nIt is nevertheless true that the program offers all the wrong incentives: Employers pay nothing when their workers go on it. And for many workers, especially those with few skills, the alternative to a steady SSDI check (and, often, Medicare) would be a minimum-wage job, possibly one without insurance.\nSign up for The Point\nGo inside New York politics. submit\nMore than 6 percent of the U.S. working-age population is on SSDI. Does that statistic represent laudable social solidarity, a scandalous excess of the welfare state or a tragic but unavoidable idling of human resources? Or is it an expression of this country's understandable ambivalence about exactly what we should expect from people who are disabled, in an age when we know that depression really does disable some people -- and that a man with two prosthetic legs can run in the Olympics?\nWe have no choice but to reconcile our conflicting goals and sentiments in a more cost-effective way than Social Security Disability Insurance does now. Otherwise, the program's growth will continue to erode productivity, swallow up scarce tax dollars, and make it that much harder to afford a sufficient safety net for everyone who needs it.\nMore coverage Matt Davies' latest cartoon: Slogans\nEditorial: LI's high cost of living can't go on\nOpinion and analysis about the 2016 presidential campaign"

Robots and machines seem to do all the work in this dystopian future, except for tasks like cleaning, manufacturing and fighting. (If you can handle the 30-second pre-roll commercial, you can view the movie trailer here.)\nWhat the financial industry would look like on Earth and Elysium in the middle of the 22nd Century isn't very clear in Neill Blomkamp's latest film, but we get some nuances.\nThere are definitely investors. The CEO of Armadyne Corporation, the builder of the space station and robots that manage security on Earth and Elysuim, speaks about the need for improved productivity, financial results and investor returns in one scene. (His name is John Carlyle, which could be a reference to today's Carlyle Group, an asset manager and private-equity firm with large investments in the aerospace and defense industries.)\nThe main industry we see in \"Elysium,\" however, is the medical industry, which is dominated by overwhelmed and struggling doctors and nurses on Earth and Med-Pod machines on the space station. People on Earth do all they can to travel to the space station in order to access the Med-Pods, which cure the body of any illness or issue in seconds after verifying Elysium citizenship.\nIt's possible that a Fund-Pod or Money-Pod could exist on Elysium as well, though none appear in the move. Such a device might read someone's information chip (planted in his or her head) and access their electronic financial records to put together a financial plan, for instance. Or a high-level financial advisor might meet in person with wealthy clients on Elysium, only to have the portfolio management and other grunt work done by a machine, humans or both back on Earth.\nSuch scenarios, of course, aren't so farfetched. We know how important software and algorithms have become to the financial services field. And ThinkAdvisor blogger Michael Kitces has written recently about the rise of the so-called \"robo-advisor,\" an online computer platform that provides financial advice directly to investors.\nKitces, however, argues that in any competition between human advisors and robo-advisors, the real winner may be \"the technology-augmented human,\" or \"cyborg advisor,\" who can wrestle equally with machines and humans. Future generations, he notes, may turn to firms like LearnVest, that is working with middle-market Gen X and Gen Y women - both online and offline -  to better take control of their personal finances.\nThis middle path might prove effective with middle-market clients. Indeed, it's a strategy that Merrill Lynch employs with its mass-affluent Merrill Edge platform, helping tech-savvy consumers become more investment-savvy investors.\nThe trouble is that in Blomkamp's \"Elysium,\" there is no middle market, because there is no more middle class. It's a future of haves (the 1%) and have-nots (the 99%).\nPresenting a world of such extremes makes for gripping storytelling and poignant sci-fi movie making. In an age in which America's middle class continues to shrink, inequality keeps rising at a dramatic rate, and economic mobility appears to becoming more limited, however, the movie also provides us with food for thought.\nFor advisors and others in the financial-services business, such a future would entail many fewer clients and, hence, very little economic opportunity in both the world of the 1% and that of the 99% - a sobering presentation of what one filmmaker believes we are confronting in many ways already today and what may lie ahead of us as well.\nMichael Kitces\ntechnology-augmented human"

        "webpage": "Charitable Giving Linked to Higher Stocks, Not Lower Taxes U.S. Trust managing director says advisors should not shy away from discussing charity\nThe stock market has risen 5% year to date, and that helps drive philanthropic giving than fears over ending the charitable deduction discourage it, a U.S. Trust wealth strategies advisor told AdvisorOne.\nWith a slew of tax law changes taking effect in the new year, and lingering questions about ending tax expenditures like the charitable deduction as Washington comes to grips with its fiscal difficulties, many discussions about philanthropy focus on the tax angle.\nBut U.S. Trust managing director Ramsay Slugg (left) says tax matters are subordinate to the performance of stocks and the health of the overall economy.\n\"Charitable giving is not as tax-motivated as we conventionally think it is,\" Slugg says. \"We know that 65% of Americans give to charity each year, which is a lot more people than pay taxes or itemize deductions.\n\"Of people who make a half-million dollars on average or above, 95% of that group give to charity each year,\" he continued. \"Not all of them take itemized deductions or pay taxes.\n\"For people who don't itemize, they don't get any tax benefit for giving. Even for people who do itemize, it makes it a little cheaper, but you don't come out with more money in the end.\n\"People give because they're charitable first,\" Slugg says.\nThe motivation for giving has policy implications, of course, but it also may serve as a signal of investor sentiment about the economy.\nSlugg cites a biannual survey that Bank of America (owner of U.S. Trust) conducts with Indiana University's Center on Philanthropy. The 2012 survey, released in November, suggested bullishness about the economy, since 76% of high-net-worth investors intended to maintain or increase their charitable giving through 2016.\n\"These [high-net-worth] people drive charitable giving. They feel bullish about the economy overall,\" Slugg says.\nJust under a third of the 700 wealthy donors surveyed viewed the favorable tax treatment of donations as a primary motivator for giving, and 50% said they would maintain or increase their donations if tax deductions were eliminated.\nWhile the U.S. Trust executive sees the stock market and economy as having more impact than taxes on high-net-worth giving, he says increased taxes - not the tax deduction - have a large impact on middle-class donors.\nSlugg says the restoration of the Social Security payroll tax, which is now taking 6.2% of workers' paychecks, up two percentage points from last year, will likely have a negative impact on charities.\n\"Not all deductions are created the same,\" he says. \"Practically speaking, mortgage interest or real estate taxes have to be paid or a bad thing is going to happen to you. But charitable donations, if you don't make them, nobody's going to kick you out of your house.\"\nNevertheless, he adds, \"if we see market growth and economic growth, that will more than offset the tax hit\" of diminished middle-class discretionary spending.\nSlugg observes that many financial advisors don't pay as much attention to their clients' charitable giving as they might.\n\"They shy away from it because they feel it's too personal,\" he says. \"But clients want to talk about their philanthropic giving.\"\nAdvisors \"ought to be having philanthropic conversations with their clients. If advisors themselves are not conversant, they should encourage their clients to talk with someone who is - whether it's a community foundation or a friendly trust group who have philanthropic experts, so they can [give] in the best way.\"\nSlugg says his own U.S. Trust serves as a trustee and offers credit, banking and alternative investment services to which many independent brokers lack access. \"There are a lot of different ways to go that an independent investment advisor's not going to spend time on that they may want to partner with somebody,\"\nHe cites as one key concern a client's desire to give efficiently. Writing a check to a charity, for example, \"is the easiest way but not the most tax-efficient way.\" Slugg says a qualified charitable distribution from an IRA to a charity or the presale of a business or other asset are among the many possible ways clients can execute their desire to maximize the efficiency of their giving.\nThe level of charitable giving is currently estimated at $300 billion a year. Slugg, who works on the biannual Bank of America high-net-worth survey, says any reduction in that level of giving as a result of ending the tax subsidy would not likely be as significant as conventional wisdom suggests.\nSchwab, LPL Investment Chiefs: Risk of Recession Is Low, but 'Not Zero'\nIndie Advisors, Firms Create $48B in Economic Output: FSI Study Vanguard's New Model for Retirement Spending in Low-Yield Market\nU.S. Trust\nCenter on Philanthropy"

This tax was repealed 10 years later, and after several variations was eventually replaced by the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which allowed the government to collect an income tax as a source of federal revenue.\nRyan McKnight\nCC-BY-2.0\nFull Answer\nThe 16th Amendment was ratified in 1913. Since then, federal income taxes have come to be seen as an indispensable part of what Oliver Wendell Holmes described as the price paid \"for a civilized society,\" according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The framers of the Constitution enumerated the government's obligation to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare. Taxes on income are the method by which the government collects the revenue necessary to execute these functions.\nAnother useful function of public taxation, according to the Treasury, is in educating the public about the real cost of the government's services. Knowing how much a certain policy will cost before it's implemented encourages lively debate and the rational cost-benefit arguments that are central to policy decisions undertaken by the citizens of a republic. A policy of general taxation thus encourages a broad public understanding of what the government does and how it operates, information vital to voters.\ntreasury.gov\nWho is responsible for levying taxes?\nIn the United States, taxes can be levied by federal, state and local governments.

        "webpage": "Groupon Wheezes Into Year 2\n\nAlthough lingering doubts over the viability of the daily deal model have been clobbering Groupon on Wall Street, it has done some things right in its first year as a public company. Notably, it has expanded its operations beyond daily deals. \"From the consultant point of view, it is doing everything we say it needs to do to squeeze out value from its relationships,\" said BIA/Kelsey's Peter Krasilovsky.\n\nBy Erika Morphy\nNov 5, 2012 10:48 AM PT\n\nJust in time for its one-year anniversary of being a public company, Groupon's response to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into its accounting practices was made public. It was an inauspicious reminder that to regulators and investors, Groupon -- once the tech industry's golden child -- remains a question mark. The stock market responded to the disclosure on Friday by sinking Groupon's share price some 5 percent to a new low of US$3.83.\n\nThe SEC had been pursuing a few lines of inquiry, including how the company estimates customer refunds that are part of its \"Groupon Promise\" guarantee, which offers subscribers a full refund if they change their mind about a purchase.\n\nThe agency began probing that particular issue in August, after Groupon's second quarter earnings report indicated it had made a large number of refunds. In the filing, Groupon said future or potential refunds was not a metric that it evaluated.\n\nGroupon did not respond to our request to comment for this story.\n\nDiminished Investor Expectations\n\nGroupon's initial public offering on Nov. 4, 2011, had been eagerly anticipated -- but doubt began to cloud it after its first S-1 filing showed an Adjusted Consolidated Segment Operating Income metric that inflated the company's worth by ignoring marketing costs. Groupon amended its filing, but not before it was widely derided.\n\nSince then, it seems the company could do no right, and the market has punished Groupon accordingly. The price of its IPO was $20 per share -- a year later, it is trading at $3.80.\n\nWithout a doubt, investor confidence in Groupon has plummeted, Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with BIA/Kelsey, told the E-Commerce Times.\n\nOn paper, the company is making all the right moves to reposition itself, he said. \"The question is, will investors have the patience to wait for some of these moves to have an impact?\"\n\nA Local Commerce Operator\n\nGroupon's big strategic play is to morph into an operator for local commerce, providing all kinds of services for small businesses. For example, Groupon recently rolled out Groupon Payments, a small business offering it described as easier and cheaper, compared to traditional payment systems.\n\n\"From the consultant point of view, it is doing everything we say it needs to do to squeeze out value from its relationships,\" said Krasilovsky.\n\nHowever, Groupon's push to become the local merchant's best friend is a race against time -- and it requires investors to take a leap of faith that it can evolve away from its early, pure play daily deal roots, he noted.\n\n\"Some of these measures could take three-to-five year to mature. In the meantime, Groupon is heavily dependent on the daily deals business,\" Krasilovsky pointed out.\n\nThe macro environment for daily deals is not pretty -- several players are losing money, and some have already closed their doors. Others continue to introduce new twists to the model, bringing even more competition.\n\nDaily Deal Doubts\n\nThe value of the daily deal model -- at least, its value for merchants -- is undeniably in doubt, Krasilovsky said. Merchant complaints have become downright commonplace, despite Groupon's efforts to address some of them -- such as predicting how a deal offer will impact supply.\n\nThose efforts may not be enough.\n\nSome of the deal terms are very one-sided in Groupon's favor, such as the tactic of offering a payout as the coupon is being used rather than in a lump sum 30 days after the deal's run, observed Scott Lorenz, president of\nWestwind Communications.\n\n\"It looks like Groupon will benefit from any shrinkage in coupon redemption rather than the client,\" he told the E-Commerce Times.\n\n\"These things are good for Groupon,\" said Lorenz, \"but not the businesses who provide goods and services at a reduced rate of 50 percent or more who figured a shrinkage rate into the deal.\""

In a speech Tuesday, he challenged a room full of broker-dealer execs to step up their game.\nThe average advisory commitment to PAS, he said in an interview Tuesday during FSI's OneVoice conference, is $250 million, and the average client of the RIAs who custody with PAS is $4 million to $5 million. \"We had a phenomenal year\" in 2013, he reported. He also said \"we're right on plan\" in PAS' goal to be \"recognized as the leader in providing custodial\" and other solutions to \"professionally managed, growth oriented advisory firms,\" who have clients \"with complex financial lives.\" Beyond the dollars in custody, Tibergien was even more pleased to report that Pershing had its \"best-ever client satisfaction\" rating and \"highest ever employee engagement\" score, which ranks whether PAS employees are \"happy and fulfilled.\" As for those employees, he said, \"we want people who are happy to be here  -  and our clients [the advisors] feel that.\"\nAnyone who knows Tibergien and has followed his career would not be surprised that he seems to naturally focus on the importance of having engaged employees, of having clear goals and positioning and of accurately measuring business success. Throughout his career, first at Moss Adams and now at Pershing, in his writings for Investment Advisor and in his industry speeches, Tibergien has been instrumental in calling on advisors to turn their practices into businesses, to apply strict metrics to their businesses, to have a clear vision of who their ideal clients are and to warn of an advisor shortage just as demand for advice is peaking.\nIn an address to a group of a hundred or so independent broker-dealer executives on Tuesday morning at the conference, Tibergien was his old self: challenging those executives over their business models and compensation methods, encouraging them to focus their positioning, cajoling them to build better businesses and asking them to look 10 years into the future, to \"begin with the end in mind,\" to determine what they should do now to achieve their goals a decade from now.\nAmong his challenging statements:\n\"This is a business built by and for boomers, but that won't last for long,\" and since the investable assets of investors under 45 is the same as those over 45, it's high time for BDs and advisors to focus on the generations following the boomers. They just might find success with younger advisors and employees, there's much that can be learned from younger people, Tibergien suggested. That's been his own experience in a program at Pershing where his reverse mentor is a 25-year-old woman, which has given him great insights into why, for instance, many young people don't want to get into the advisory business. Independent broker-dealers \"sit in the realm of supervised independence,\" in which they \"straddle the line\" between the employee-based wirehouses and the fully independent RIA space. \"If you're focusing on advisor succession planning, stop it,\" he said to the executives. Focus instead on advisor development. After all, he half-joked, \"a business strategy focusing on the dead and dying is an interesting one...having preached about the importance of succession planning since the 1980s, I feel like the loneliest missionary on the planet.\" Rethink your priorities. Along similar lines to the point above, he suggested that BDs \"spend less on recruiting and more on development\" of existing advisors, noting in passing that BDs are \"mostly trading old people\" among themselves through recruiting. Watch your language. When you speak of your independent contractor representatives, are you speaking about 'reps' and 'producers,' when \"you should be talking to advisors?\" Expect more consolidation. Tibergien reported that there were \"600 to 700 fewer broker-dealers\" in 2013 alone. Outsource. \"If it's core to your business, own it; if not, rent it.\"\nHe left his audience with the notion that broker-dealers' business models may well change, that \"many BDs have muddled positioning\" that sounds the same as all other BDs and that compensation models for advisors should reflect the importance of serving existing clients rather than gaining new clients.\nAfter presenting all these challenges, Tibergien left his listeners with an optimistic, empowering insight: you can live in the past, complain about the present or create the future.\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

And although our attention is drawn moth-like to the incandescence of large-scale events like these, the point of conception for any significant failure - in geophysics, in biology, in economics - starts upstream. Oftentimes, way upstream.\nOne of the keystones in my firm's hypothesis that negotiated financial markets are complex social systems, is the idea that markets are simply networks and investors are the nodes in those networks, interacting in complex ways through feedback mechanisms subject to non-linear dynamics. Though the importance of economic, institutional, legal, operational, and regulatory connections in this network cannot be underestimated, the \"markets\" are just a networked collection of traders competing and cooperating in both general and specific ways.\nThis is such an axiomatic statement that it begs the question, so what? There is precisely nothing novel in the idea that markets are a network of connected investors. Charles Mackay wrote the now-classic book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds 172 years ago in which he laid bare some of the basics of this idea: social psychology as a \"network effect.\" More than a convenient analogy, however, we believe that viewing financial markets as networks allows us to employ some interesting theoretical and practical network-theory research with the explicit goal of trying to understand the network dynamics of financial markets. What gives rise to large-scale volatility events? How and why do markets enter different regimes of behavior? What role does interconnectedness play in market stability?\nThe last decade or so has seen an important formalism brought to bear on network theory: Data has been teased from both real-world and theoretical-network models that strongly suggest some grossly universal behaviors may exist across different types of networks. That is, networks of any stripe - bees, molecules, viruses, electrical systems, people - have generally similar behavior in their growth, stasis, and, most pertinent to fiduciaries, their failures.\nThere exists a large body of academic research that has formalized some of the concepts of network theory. For readers interested in further study, the yellow brick road of this discipline could start at any number of places, but we think Networks: An Introduction, by M. E. J. Newman from Oxford University is a good start.\nFor our part, network theory has helped us to identify similarities and differences in, say, earthquake propagation and market volatility, by understanding their underlying network-based causes. It has enabled us to explore the application of certain classes of mathematics that have been used to model other networks of connected agents. It has allowed us to explore concepts like information cascades and instabilities.\nMore generally, network theorists have proposed that highly interdependent networks are simultaneously fragile and robust: Fragile in the sense that a single perturbation at one node could theoretically affect large-scale changes in the rest of the network. Robust in the sense that such networks are capable of evolving - responding to exogenous or endogenous catalysts - rapidly. Examples include the following: the power-grid failure that results from a lightning strike to a transformer; the swine flu pandemic that results from one interaction between a farmer and a pig; and more germane, the \"flash crash\" that results from one relatively small sel"

It is already the biggest exporter, auto buyer and steel producer, and its global influence is expanding.\nChina has been a major force behind the world's emergence from deep recession, delivering much-needed juice to the U.S., Japan and Europe. Tokyo's latest numbers, however, suggest that Chinese demand alone may not be enough for Japan or other economic giants.\n\"Japan is the canary in the goldmine because it depends very much on demand in Asia and China, and this demand is cooling quite a bit,\" said Martin Schulz, senior economist at Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo. \"This is a warning sign for all major economies that just focusing on overseas demand won't be sufficient.\"\nChina has surpassed Japan in quarterly GDP figures before, but this time it's unlikely to relinquish the lead.\nChina's economy will almost certainly be bigger than Japan's at the end of 2010 because of the huge difference in each country's growth rates. China is growing at about 10 percent a year, while Japan's economy is forecast to grow between 2 to 3 percent this year. The gap between the size of the two economies at the end of last year was already narrow.\nJapan's nominal GDP, which isn't adjusted for price and seasonal variations, was worth $1.286 trillion in the April-to-June quarter compared with $1.335 trillion for China.

        "webpage": "The New Europe What German vote means for Europe's economy By Mark Thompson @MarkThompsonCNN Chancellor Angela Merkel is still the most popular political leader in Germany but she may be forced into a coalition with the Social Democrats after Sunday's election. Germany votes on Sunday in its first national elections since the euro zone crisis exploded in 2010. Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-right Christian Democrats are seeking a third term after governing for four years in a coalition with the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), and from 2005-2009 in a grand coalition with the center-left Social Democrats. Here are 5 things you need to know about the election: Why does it matter? Germany is Europe's biggest economy, a manufacturing and export powerhouse. Its 2.7 trillion euro GDP accounts for nearly 30% of euro zone output. And the country has gained influence because of its role as the biggest financial contributor to Europe's bailouts. Merkel may be a hated figure to some Europeans for her insistence on austerity in return for aid, but most Germans approve of her handling of the crisis. Who is likely to win? Until recently, Merkel and her coalition allies had a clear lead in opinion polls, but support for her party and the FDP has fallen. If the FDP drops below the 5% threshold needed to win seats in parliament, Merkel will lose her preferred coalition partner. Analysts say a repeat of the 2005-2009 coalition with the Social Democrats is now the most likely outcome of Sunday's vote, particularly if the new anti-euro party AfD makes a breakthrough. Related: Could euroskeptics spoil Angela Merkel's election party What's at stake in Europe? With the recession over and markets calmer, the pace of EU policy making has eased. But big challenges remain for a region still facing slow growth, record unemployment, an aging population and rising debt. Greece needs more help and Portugal might need a second bailout. What's more, progress on repairing the European banking system, which is critical to unfreezing credit markets and restoring long-term economic health, has slowed. Germany, of course, will remain the central player in deciding the future of Europe's crisis response, including rescues and closer cooperation between euro zone states on issues like a banking union. But European policy is unlikely to change if Merkel continues to govern with the FDP. And even if she's forced into a grand coalition, any shift is likely to be very subtle. Related: Greece joining euro was a mistake: Merkel While the Social Democrats have taken a softer tone on austerity, they have backed Merkel on all the big European decisions during the crisis. \"The power and willingness of the SPD to cause an overhaul in euro-politics from the German side is very limited,\" noted BNP Paribas economist Evelyn Hermann. Merkel: Europe has lived beyond its means What about the German economy? Germany is the second most productive of the G-7 economies after the United States, based on GDP per hours worked. Its unemployment rate is the second lowest in Europe and it managed growth of 0.7% in the second quarter, having avoided the recession that gripped much of the euro zone for 18 months. German stocks are at record highs, and businesses haven't been as upbeat about their prospects for more than three years. But some economists are warning of creeping complacency. One of the talking points in the election campaign has been the millions of working Germans barely able to cover more than their basic needs. The Social Democrats would look to raise income tax rates, introduce a national minimum wage and limit the use of temporary work contracts. \"The impact on the short-term business cycle would be negligible,\" noted Berenberg economists. \"But over time, Germany could lose its current position as one of the best places to do business in Europe. That would be costly.\" Will markets react to the results? The most likely outcome -- a grand coalition led by Merkel -- would have little market impact. But if she suffers a surprise defeat and the Social Democrats are tempted to try to form a government with the Greens and far left, investors will be unsettled by the risks to the German economy and the increased chances of further backsliding on debt-cutting in Europe.

Africa's economic growth is more broad-based, argues the report, driven by domestic demand, infrastructure and increased continental trade in manufactured goods.\n\"In order to sustain the economic growth and ensure that it creates opportunities for all, African countries should continue to rebuild shock absorbers and exercise prudent macro management. Any slackening on macro management will undermine future economic growth,\" said Mthuli Ncube, Chief Economist and Vice-President of the African Development Bank.\n\"In the medium- to long-term, the opportunity for participating in global value chains, should be viewed as part of the strategy for achieving strong, sustained and inclusive growth,\" he added. The report argues that more effective participation in regional and global value chains - the range of activities in different countries that bring a product from conception to delivery to the consumer - could serve as a springboard for Africa in economic diversification, domestic resource mobilisation and investments in critical infrastructure. In order to do so, however, the continent needs to avoid getting stuck in low value-added activities.\nFor instance, Africa's exports to the rest of the world grew faster than those of any other region in 2012, but they remain dominated by primary commodities and accounted for only 3.5 percent of world merchandise exports in 2012.\nAvoiding that trap involves investing in new and more productive sectors, building skills, creating jobs and acquiring new technology, knowledge and market information. These interventions require sound public policies, as well as entrepreneurs that are willing and capable of helping achieve these gains.\nThe report uses the example of South Africa, which achieved a remarkable turnaround in its automotive industry by removing obstacles and providing incentives for component producers and assembly lines. It also shows that the development of agribusiness value chains in countries such as Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia has contributed to economic growth and job creation.\n\"African economies have a great potential to build on their demographic dynamism, rapid urbanisation and natural-resources assets. The challenge now for many of them is to ensure that greater insertion into global value chains is achieved and has a positive impact on people's lives,\" said Mario Pezzini, Director of the OECD Development Centre.\n\"Public policies need to be articulated in a targeted strategy that promotes more equitable economic and social transformation and an environmentally sound development,\" he added.\nThe African Economic Outlook shows that there has been remarkable progress in human development, with lower poverty levels, rising incomes and improving rates of school enrollment and health coverage.\nFurther achieving real human development gains requires empowering people and ensuring environmental sustainability, so that economic growth can yield benefits for all. In order for value chains to effectively integrate the poor and marginalized, often including women, targeted public policies and inclusive business models should facilitate access to productive assets such as land and financing, enhance productivity, and improve the resilience of small producers.\n\"As engagement with global value chains deepens, the appropriate measures need to be in place to mitigate the risks which they can bring about, such as volatile prices, unfair competition and increased vulnerability,\" said Pedro Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Chief Economist at UNDP's Regional Bureau for Africa. \"While regional and global economic networks present immense opportunities, women, men and communities must be able to compete from a position of strength.\" For the full report, including statistics and 54 individual country notes, please visit .\nFor more information on the African Development Bank's 2014 Annual Meetings, visit .

        "webpage": "Print Edition20140828 Gray zoneCover Story\nAugust 28, 2014 12:00 am JST\nPrachi Priya: India's youth -- blessing or curse?\nIndia is home to the largest cohort of young people in the world, with 825 million people under the age of 35 -- almost 66% of its population. The median age of the country is just 27, compared with 37 in the U.S. and 46 in Japan. Statistics like these suggest that India has a competitive advantage over China and other Asian countries because of its favorable demographics. But any demographic dividend is just a window of opportunity -- it gives no guarantee of economic growth. It certainly does not mean that India will not age at all. By 2050, the median age will be 37, and the number of over-60s will have risen from 100 million to 300 million. The process will be slower and less dramatic than in other countries, but broad-based reforms in the health and education sectors, financial inclusion, and adequate employment opportunities are required to capitalize on the dividend. India's policymakers face the dual challenge of simultaneously providing financial security and health care benefits for the elderly and more jobs for young people. The latter will require an expansion of the manufacturing sector, improvements in skills, better education, greater female participation in the labor force and better vocational training.Wanted: 100 million new jobsThe government has made a start. India's first National Manufacturing Policy, announced in 2011, envisaged a rise in the manufacturing sector's share of gross domestic product to 25% by 2022, and the creation of an additional 100 million manufacturing jobs. As the report put it: \"Every job created in manufacturing has a multiplier effect of creating two to three additional jobs in related activities. Therefore, a thrust on manufacturing is integral to the inclusive growth agenda of the government.\" Yet there are few indications of progress. The share of manufacturing in India's GDP has stagnated at 15%, with only 14% of the workforce employed in the sector. India also needs to address an acute skills mismatch that has led to higher unemployment and underemployment. Only 2% of the existing workforce has undergone formal skills training, and only three workers in 20 have marketable skills. But 90% of available jobs are skills-based. Increasing the employability of young workers through improvements in education and vocational training is vital if India is to minimize the aging problems it will eventually have to face. In the short to medium term, much more needs to be done to address the financial, psychological and physical needs of the aged. This is, in itself, a challenging objective, not least because the elderly should not be seen as a homogeneous group. In particular, the concerns of urban senior citizens may be very different from those of people in rural areas. A joint study by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India and consultancy KPMG found that while health issues and loneliness were prominent problems among the urban elderly, financial problems were a bigger concern in the countryside. It is also a job for both the public and private sectors. A national policy to cope with the aging population must address basic needs such as proper health care facilities, sustainable income streams and social security. But the private sector also needs to do more to identify market opportunities. With rising per capita income and rapid urbanization, an aging India has the potential to create more demand for new products and services. With care, an age-friendly approach in business strategy will be profitable in the long run. Potential business sectors that could benefit from this demographic trend include retirement housing, cosmetics, financial planning, insurance, health care, leisure and consumer goods. There have already been some successes. For example, an elderly-friendly phone launched by iBall, the Indian digital technology group, was quickly followed by competing products from bigger companies, such as Samsung Electronics of South Korea. Other age-related innovations have included hearing aids, retirement homes, nonprescription health products and telemedicine. But most businesses are still not prepared to tap the growing gray market. As Boston Consulting Group said in a report: \"Companies either do not perceive the magnitude of global aging, or are too consumed by short-term imperatives to act.\"Jobless growth?Despite India's remarkable economic performance since it began to liberalize in 1991, there is some truth in the often repeated criticism that the country has embarked on a path of jobless growth. This is because the service sector-led growth model that India has adopted is capital-intensive rather than labor-intensive, raising the dangerous prospect that economic growth will continue without a big increase in employment opportunities for the young. The problem is a pressing one. Already, one in six young male urban graduates is unemployed. This necessitates an urgent overhaul of the education system, combined with a revival of the labor-intensive manufacturing sector. The promise of India's demographic dividend will not last long. By delaying action, the country could easily turn its dividend into a demographic curse. Close Prachi Priya is a corporate economist based in Mumbai.

Accounting & Tax Marketing GAAP\nUnlike FASB's avatars, international financial reporting standards may be catching on because their creators are super sellers.\nAlan Rappeport, Contributor January 11, 2008 | CFO.com | US share\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board isn't known for its marketing prowess. As the caretaker of America's accounting standards, the outfit is often derided for spawning overly rigid and complex rules. What's more, while its international counterpart hands out its standards to anyone who will adopt them, FASB is seen as stingy with its pricey copyrights and bound volumes.\nBut FASB may be starting to take a more welcoming tack. All of its pronouncements are now freely downloadable from its Website. Further, it's launching a \"codification\" project aimed at simplifying accounting by gathering feedback from practitioners. Still, some think FASB has room for improvement, and that the success of international financial reporting standards, all the rage these days, is the result of standard-setters who know how to market their product.\nFASB \"has long protected its brand name, including by asserting copyright over its U.S. GAAP standards and selling them for profit,\" says Lawrence Cunningham, a George Washington University law and accounting professor. \"In contrast, [the International Accounting Standards Board], its international counterpart, although also asserting copyright over its international financial-reporting standards, gives its products away free to all persons within any country that recognizes IFRS as official.\"\n\"Too Much GAAP Running Around\" Sweeping Away GAAP FASB's Herz Calls for \"Choice with a Timetable\" Cunningham argues that the differing approaches symbolize why people have positive associations with the IFRS but tend to loathe America's GAAP. Early versions of the IFRS were considered hazy and vague, but the revamped model has charmed users with its passion for principles. \"People ridicule rules-based systems as bad and costly,\" he told CFO.com. \"Principles are wonderful, easy to use, and allow for the exercise of judgment. It's an easy thing to sell.\"\nThe International Accounting Standards Board has had good success getting the IFRS adopted in more than 100 countries. Cunningham suggests that part of the reason stems from its policy of waiving its copyright restrictions in countries that adopt the international standard.\nAs more countries adopt the IFRS, the more easily it can be marketed as the best set of standards. \"Our objective is to encourage use of IFRSs across the world,\" says the IASB's Mark Byatt, noting that the text of the standards has to be written into the law of each country. \"In most countries the text of law is freely available, so we waive copyright in each adopting country for the bare standards to allow this to happen.\"\nFASB posts digital versions of its various pronouncements on its Website. Those, however, are for individual use and can't be reproduced. If a publisher wants to reproduce FASB documents, it must apply for and buy a license.\nAlthough U.S. accounting rules are enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, their status as laws is a topic of debate. Some consider accounting rules to be \"business practices\"; yet because violating the rules can bring legal action, Cunningham contends they are \"de facto\" laws and that copyrights should be waived.\nBefore the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which provided FASB with funding, its entire budget came from the sale of its publications. Now, although it has federal funding, it still earns $17 million a year from its bound volumes and other products, according to Ron Guerrette, vice president of the Financial Accounting Foundation, which oversees FASB. A full set of its bound volumes can sell for up to $240 each.\nIn a paper Cunningham published in the Michigan Law Review in 2005, he noted that FASB could easily drop its copyright fees now that it has funding. In fact, he wrote, sales of publications could potentially be disguised contributions from those trying to influence FASB's decisions.\nFor Cunningham, the crusade against FASB's copyrights is also personal. When he wanted to use FASB pronouncements in a textbook for class on accounting and law, it took him five months and $3,000 to gain access. FASB contends that the point is moot since all of its rules are available online and because changes may be on the way with convergence of accounting standards moving ahead quickly.\nDespite those changes, FASB is unlikely to drop its right to charge for its publications anytime soon. \"We have the copyrights for this material and we are allowed to charge for them,\" says Guerrette.\n\u2190 Giuliani Poses Deep Corporate Tax Cuts Tomorrow, the World \u2192"

A recent regulatory change levels the playing field for actively managed ETFs competing with traditional mutual funds\nPIMCO star manager Bill Gross' bond ETF may have been the biggest exchange-traded story of 2012, having gone from zero to nearly $4 billion in assets under management in a matter of months.\nThe infant ETF, just 10 months old, is not only asset-rich but novel in another way. It is one of the first and few actively managed ETFs, a tiny segment of the exchange-traded marketplace accounting for less than 1% of the $1.4 trillion in ETF assets.\nIndeed, though the number of actively managed ETFs has risen to 53, the PIMCO Total Return ETF (BOND) alone accounts for close to 40% of that segment's $10.6 billion in assets.\nBut the removal of a key regulatory barrier that may have limited the growth of actively managed ETFs in the past three years could augur for growth in this corner of the ETF sphere, according to asset management attorney Richard Morris.\nIn an interview with AdvisorOne, Morris (right) cited the SEC's lifting of the moratorium on the use of derivatives by actively managed funds that use derivatives as one of the key developments in ETF regulation that could impact the retail level of ETF investors this year.\nAnnounced by the SEC's director of investment management, Norm Champ, in December, the lifting of the moratorium was accompanied by a \"no-action\" letter, clearing the way for asset managers to expand in or enter the actively managed ETF space for the first time.\n\"The likely outcome of the lifting of the ban on the use of derivatives in actively managed ETFs is that we'll see new types of ETFs entering the marketplace and an expansion of the types of strategies used by ETFs,\" Morris says. \"The change may prompt asset managers that may have been on the sidelines to enter the market.\"\nThe attorney, a partner of New York-based Morgan, Lewis & Bockius and formerly general counsel of WisdomTree Asset Management, says the move puts ETFs on more of a level playing field with traditional mutual funds with respect to use of derivatives.\n\"The change does not impact the ETF listing process overseen by the SEC's Division of Trading and Markets,\" Morris adds. \"Industry participants are looking for further action to shorten the process used to list active ETFs on exchanges.\"\nNot only does the lifting of the moratorium on derivatives use level the playing field between ETFs and traditional mutual funds, but it also levels the field between new and early entrants in the actively managed ETF space, Morris says:\n\"The imposition of the moratorium in 2010 created a regulatory dichotomy. Those sponsors that had already obtained exemptive relief were able to use derivatives.\"\nWhile the regulatory change could alter the ETF landscape in 2013, there remains reason for doubt, according to ETFguide.com and AdvisorOne contributor Ron DeLegge.\n\"The ultimate question is will more active mangers opt in favor of the ETF format,\" DeLegge said in an interview. \"If I'm an active manager, the ETF format is not something I'm interested in. The fees are brutal; you can charge more in a hedge fund or mutual funds. You also have transparency: I don't want my daily holdings revealed.\"\nDeLegge also noted that the 2012 actively managed ETF trend in some ways is less than encouraging.\n\"You've only got one star - Bill Gross,\" he says. \"The other ones are struggling.\"\nCheck out AdvisorOne's InsideETFs 2013 enhanced landing page for more ETF-related stories.\nRon DeLegge\nNorm Champ\nDivision of Trading and Markets\nInsideETFs 2013\nretail level\nMorgan, Lewis & Bockius"

Edwards is an associate professor at the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University.\nNOV 28, 2012 0\nThe Eurozone/Greece Deal: Summitry and Spin\nThere have already been many articles written dissecting the results of Monday night's Eurozone summit. Early reactions to the summit were positive, but more recent reactions from the markets have been more muted. These more sober reactions by financial markets are not surprising, since this has been the trend all along in watching how markets respond to EU summits. The case for market pessimism, however, is based on more than the extant empirical trend. Thinking about the manner in which the results of the summit were made public indicates a number of problems which may scuttle the Greek program altogether. In the first case, the public details are not the whole story. The solutions offered to Greece (in the form of lowered interest rates, lengthened maturities and a repatriation to Athens of ECB profits) are all on the basis of assessments of how Greece's debt will change over time. This debts sustainability analysis was not released to the public. Instead, it was leaked to the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. This is nothing new, as these leaks also occurred earlier this year as the IMF was preparing its letter of intent. This is a pattern that needs to stop. The \"troika\" (comprised of the IMF, the ECB, and the EU) needs to be much more transparent about how it conducts its business. This is the only way to convince the market that they are taking appropriate steps and insure its buy-in. In addition to the sin of omission regarding the debt sustainability analysis, the discussion of the debt buy-back, which accounts for reducing Greece's debt by 11% of GDP in 2020, is at best opaque. Early reports suggested that Greece was responsible for the money purchasing the debt on its own, but it now looks that the Eurozone is lending Greece the money. Greece needs the debt buy-back to be hugely successful not only to position itself moving forward, but also to unlock the rest of the troika funding from the IMF. Much of the backstory to these negotiations has been the public spat between the EU and the IMF concerning the appropriate level of Greek debt in future years, with the IMF insisting on 120% of GDP in 2020. While a debate over the appropriate level of debt eight years from now can seem trivial, the Fund has made the release of its share of the money for Greece contingent on a successful debt buy-back program. This means that the potential for more bickering between troika members should this buy-back fail. A squabble deferred, of course, is not a squabble resolved, and the lack of transparency about the debt buy-back is a bad sign. Finally, there remains a profound unanswered question in this agreement: Can Greece Deliver? No one would dispute that Greece has made impressive efforts in reforms, but austerity is a political problem, not an economic one. Politicians have to vote for bills that cut spending and raise taxes, and these decisions are not made lightly. Greece has already been through two elections this year, and there are absolute limits to how hard international lenders can push a coalition government in a country with 25% unemployment. The expectations for Greece, then, are based on heroism rather than realism. For 2014-2016, the target for Greece's primary surplus (which is government revenues minus spending) is 4.5% of GDP. Germany, the hallmark of fiscal rectitude in the Eurozone, has only gotten close to this primary surplus level once since 1991. Our inability to tailor economic adjustment to the political constraints that governments face means that we're certain to face more political infighting within Greece, and more controversy as it is unable to deliver on its promises, not because it won't, but because it can't. It's ironic that the same international organizations that preach transparency fail to practice it, but the reasons behind this opacity are not difficult to understand. Just as poker players bluff to win a pot, summit documents such as these are constructed to create the appearance of consensus where one might not exist. This consensus may well unravel in the weeks to come, and we've already seen where the potential fault lines are going to emerge.\nsorosFP100\nSantiago Zabala\nThis commentary does not yet have any comments.

Katz\n450 Fifth Street, NW\nRe: Certification of Disclosure in Companies' Quarterly and Annual Reports Rule\nDear Secretary Katz:\nI am writing to comment on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, \"Certification of Disclosure in Companies' Quarterly and Annual Reports.\"1 The proposed rule implements Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, requiring corporate officer responsibility for public company audit procedures and financial accuracy.2 The Office of Advocacy of the U.S. Small Business Administration (Advocacy) commends the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its regulatory analysis of the proposed rule's impacts on small businesses.3 As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the SEC's analysis includes alternatives to alleviate the proposed rule's disproportionate regulatory burdens on small businesses. Advocacy was established pursuant to Pub. L. 94-305 to represent the views of small business before Federal agencies and Congress. The RFA, as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), gives small entities a voice in the rulemaking process. The RFA requires Federal agencies, such as the SEC, to consider alternatives to avoid overly burdensome regulation of small entities.4 Advocacy is also required by Section 612 of the RFA to monitor agency compliance with the RFA.5\nAdvocacy commends the SEC for their effort in creating a plain English certification form. Advocacy would like to work with the SEC to ensure that the certification form remains simple so that small businesses can easily comply with the certification requirements.6 Advocacy respectfully submits the following comments on the pending SEC rulemaking. I. Additional Small Business Considerations\nIn addition to the certification form, Advocacy offers for the SEC's consideration two further alternatives to significantly reduce burdens on small businesses while achieving the goal of full and fair disclosure. First, Advocacy encourages the SEC to allow small businesses sufficient lead time to properly certify their financial statements and their internal audit controls. Second, because smaller companies generally do not alter their internal controls from quarter to quarter, we suggest that the SEC allow small businesses to renew their previous report upon a company's review of the controls and a finding of no material changes. A. Advocacy recommends a sufficient transition periods for small business\nThe SEC has devoted much time and effort to ensuring that the everyday investors in this country are provided with timely and accurate corporate information. Advocacy enjoys the opportunity to work with the SEC to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on small businesses while ensuring that investors are provided with full and fair disclosure. Small businesses have limited financial reporting resources. For small businesses to provide accurate and full disclosure, Advocacy recommends that the SEC allow sufficient time for small businesses to begin certifying. Advocacy suggests that small businesses' certification begin with the first annual report filing for the fiscal year ending after the SEC's promulgation of regulations. According to securities professionals and industry participants, small business registrants generally do not employ a permanent staff member charged with securities law compliance. We believe tha"

        "webpage": "Marginal conditional stochastic dominance\n\nIn finance, marginal conditional stochastic dominance is a condition under which a portfolio can be improved in the eyes of all risk-averse investors by incrementally moving funds out of one asset (or one sub-group of the portfolio's assets) and into another.  Each risk-averse investor is assumed to maximize the expected value of an increasing, concave von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. All such investors prefer portfolio B over portfolio A if the portfolio return of B is second-order stochastically dominant over that of A; roughly speaking this means that the density function of A's return can be formed from that of B's return by pushing some of the probability mass of B's return to the left (which is disliked by all increasing utility functions) and then spreading out some of the density mass (which is disliked by all concave utility functions).\n\nIf a portfolio A is marginally conditionally stochastically dominated by some incrementally different portfolio B, then it is said to be inefficient in the sense that it is not the optimal portfolio for anyone. Note that this context of portfolio optimization is not limited to situations in which mean-variance analysis applies.\n\nThe presence of marginal conditional stochastic dominance is sufficient, but not necessary, for a portfolio to be inefficient. This is because marginal conditional stochastic dominance only considers incremental portfolio changes involving two sub-groups of assets  -  one whose holdings are decreased and one whose holdings are increased. It is possible for an inefficient portfolio to not be second-order stochastically dominated by any such one-for-one shift of funds, and yet to by dominated by a shift of funds involving three or more sub-groups of assets.\n\nTesting\n\nYitzhaki and Mayshar presented a linear programming-based approach to testing for portfolio inefficiency which works even when the necessary conditional of marginal conditional stochastic dominance is not met. Other similar tests have also been developed.\n\nReferences\n\n finance"

        "webpage": "comments Biggest budget busters: Spending or tax cuts? By Jeanne Sahadi @CNNMoney February 4, 2013: 5:32 AM ET What's to blame for the big growth in federal debt? The fact is both spending and taxes play a role. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) What's to blame for the big growth in federal debt? Republicans blame runaway spending. Democrats blame tax cuts. Neither is quite right. The fact is both spending and taxes play a role. Take the past four years. Annual deficits topped $1 trillion. One of the big culprits: The financial crisis and recession. When the economy fell through the floor, revenues plunged to near 60-year lows, while spending rose to near 60-year highs as Congress sought to combat the downturn. Congress and President Obama also approved large temporary tax cuts and extended old ones. But those weren't the only causes. \"The growing debt also reflects an imbalance between spending and revenues that predated the recession,\" Congressional Budget Office director Doug Elmendorf noted in Senate testimony last summer. In other words, tax cuts and new spending that lawmakers don't offset can increase the budget imbalance for years to come. Looking ahead to the next 10 years, a key reason for anticipated deficits are several measures in the fiscal cliff deal struck over New Year's. That deal made a decade's worth of tax cuts for the vast majority of Americans permanent, and it included other changes that will lighten many Americans' tax burden. Related: Automatic spending cuts more likely now Two provisions alone will reduce revenue by an estimated $3.3 trillion: Extending the Bush-era tax cuts for those making less than $450,000 and giving middle- and upper-middle-income families permanent relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax -- also known as the wealth tax. That $3.3 trillion will likely account for almost half of the expected 10-year deficit between now and 2023. The official estimate will be included in a Congressional Budget Office report due on Tuesday. Spending will play a role, too, of course. The retiring of the Baby Boomer generation will be in full swing over the next decade. At least 10,000 Baby Boomers are turning 65 every day; by 2030, 18% of the country will be at least 65 years old, up from about 13% today, according to the Pew Research Center. So Medicare and Social Security costs will go up, while discretionary spending -- which is what funds most government programs other than the entitlements -- is on track to fall to a 50-year low as a share of the economy. The real takeaway? \"Either you're not taxing enough to pay for entitlements. Or you're spending more on entitlements than you're willing to raise revenue for,\" said Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a deficit watchdog group. Growth in entitlement spending will accelerate after the next decade. The aging of the population will be the major reason for that acceleration over the next 25 years or so, Gordon notes. But then the biggest problem becomes the persistently high rates of growth in health costs, which typically have outpaced economic growth. Obama's 2nd term: What to expect on taxes The potentially good news is that health care spending has slowed in the past three years, though it's not clear yet how much of the slowdown is due to the recession and how much reflects industry and consumer response to the new health reforms. One thing is becoming increasingly clear, however. \"Given the aging of the population and the rising cost of health care, attaining a sustainable budget for the federal government will require the United States to deviate from the policies of the past 40 years,\" Elmendorf noted in a blog post. There are four tough choices on offer: raise tax revenue well above its 40-year average; make big changes to future seniors' benefits; shrink everything else the government funds from defense to food stamps to education; or, some combination of the above.

The decline in layoffs is helping strengthen the job market.\nWeekly unemployment benefit applications rose just 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 336,000, the Labor Department said Thursday.\nOver the past four weeks, the average number of applications has dropped by 7,500 to 339,750. That's the lowest since February 2008, just three months into the recession.\nSeparately, sales of previously occupied homes rose last month to their highest level in more than three years, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. And a measure of future U.S. economic growth increased in February for the third straight month, according to the Conference Board, a business research group.\nThe three reports Thursday supported other recent data that show the economy is improving after stalling at the end of last year.\nEconomists pay close attention to the four-week average of applications because it can smooth out week to week fluctuations. The steady decline in unemployment claims signals that companies are laying off fewer workers. That suggests many aren't worried about economic conditions in the near future.\nThe four-week average has fallen nearly 15 percent since November. The trend has coincided with acceleration in the job market.\n\"Improvement in labor market conditions continues,\" Julia Coronado, an economist at BNP Paribas, said in a note to clients.\nApplications spiked in the recession as companies slashed millions of workers from their payrolls. The number of people seeking benefits averaged only 320,000 a week in 2007, before the recession began. That figure soared to 418,000 in 2008 and 574,000 in 2009.\nIt's taken more than three years to unwind those increases. Applications fell to 459,000 in 2010, 409,000 in 2011, and finally down to 375,000 last year. In the first 10 weeks of this year they are averaging just below 350,000.\nFewer layoffs have helped boost job gains in recent months. Employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs per month since November. That's nearly double the average from last spring.\nAnd in February, the unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of 7.7 percent.\nJennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the drop in the average number of unemployment applications over the past month suggests job gains in March could top 200,000.\nNearly 5.4 million people were receiving unemployment aid as of the week ended March 2, the latest data available. That was about 250,000 fewer than the previous week. The data on total unemployment benefit recipients are not seasonally adjusted and is volatile.\nThe job market is benefiting from stronger auto sales and a healthy recovery in housing. Homebuilding permits jumped to their highest level in 4 \u00bd years in February, suggesting that recent strong gains in home construction will continue. New-home sales jumped 16 percent in January to the highest level since July 2008. Auto sales, meanwhile, rose in January and February after hitting a five-year high in 2012.\nThe housing and auto sectors are being helped by the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep interest rates low, policies the Fed stood by Wednesday after a two-day meeting.\nThe Fed reinforced its plan to keep short-term interest rates at record lows at least until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent, as long as the inflation outlook remains mild. And it said it would continue buying $85 billion a month in bonds indefinitely to keep long-term borrowing costs down.\nDuring a news conference after the meeting, Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged the job market has accelerated but said the Fed wants to see sustained improvement before altering its stimulus policies. Unemployment benefit applications are one of the measures Bernanke said the Fed is closely monitoring."

Total student debt outstanding appears to have surpassed $1 trillion late last year, said officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency created in the wake of the financial crisis. That would be roughly 16% higher than an estimate earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Total student debt outstanding appears to have surpassed $1 trillion late last year, roughly 16% higher than an estimate earlier this year by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Joshua Mitchell has details on Markets Hub. (Photo: AP/Reed Saxon)\nThe new figure - released Wednesday at a banking conference in Austin, Texas - is a preliminary finding from a study of student debt that the bureau plans to release this summer. Bureau officials said the estimate is based on a survey of private lenders, as opposed to other estimates that rely on a sampling of consumer credit reports. CFPB officials say student debt is rising for several reasons, including a surge in Americans going to college in recent years to escape the weak labor market. Also, tuition increases - which many colleges say are needed to offset big cuts in state funding - have many students taking out bigger loans. In addition, the interest costs on older loans are climbing as borrowers fall behind on payments, reflecting mounting financial strains, bureau officials said. New York Fed data show that as many as one in four student borrowers who have begun repaying their education debts are behind on payments. More Law School Wins in Graduate Suit Economists say college is an increasingly good investment because of the widening pay gap between jobs that require a degree and those that don't. Ultimately, the educational degrees and added skills are meant to help workers earn higher incomes that, in time, will more than offset the student debt. But as more people go to college and assume bigger loans for education, they may take longer than previous generations to hit key milestones such as buying a house or getting married, U.S. officials and economists say. It could take longer for heavily indebted graduates to save money for a down payment on a home, or it could be harder for them to qualify for mortgages. Rohit Chopra, student-loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said student debt could ultimately slow the recovery of the housing market. \"First-time home-buyers are a substantial part of the housing market,\" Mr. Chopra said in a speech at the banking conference in Austin. \"Instead of saving for a down payment, these borrowers are sending big payments every month.\" Student debt is a burden not just for recent college graduates in their 20s but also parents, who often co-sign their children's student loans, as well as midcareer professionals who opted to go back to school during the sluggish recovery. David Johnson, a 58-year-old groundskeeper from Milton, Wash., decided to leave gardening after more than two decades to become a nurse. Two years ago, he took out about $18,000 in private and federal loans to attend a local community college that had a nursing program. After completing prerequisite classes, he learned that the program had a waiting list. With no guarantee of getting into the nursing program, he is wondering whether to take out more debt to continue in school. \"It's an awkward place to be. I'm not yet a nurse but I've got all this debt and interest compounding on me,\" he said. \"I don't have a lot of working years left and I'm saddled with this debt.\" Write to Josh Mitchell at  Email"

        "webpage": "More older Americans staying in work force\nWashington  -  The number of Americans 65 and older either working or looking for jobs has grown by 50 percent since 1980, the Census Bureau said Tuesday.\nExperts said it was due to people living longer and wanting to work, as well as concerns that retirement savings were being eaten up by stock market losses and that Social Security and other benefits wouldn't cover senior citizens' needs.\nIn 1980, about 3 million people -- 12.6 percent of the 24.2 million residents 65 and older -- were in the labor force. The share of older workers declined to 11.9 percent in 1990, but it has risen steadily since then, according to census data.\nBy March 2002, the number of older people with jobs or seeking one was 4.5 million -- 13.2 percent of the 65-and-over population.\nWith the economy stumbling since then, that number probably is higher now, said Edward Coyle, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans.\n\"People are more nervous now than they were a year ago,\" Coyle said. \"You have lots of folks approaching retirement age, scratching their heads and wondering if they can do it.\"\nOther findings\nThe latest Census Bureau data comes from a nationwide survey of 70,000 homes in March 2002 that covered a range of socioeconomic characteristics, from income to education. Among other findings:\nl About one-third of those 65 and older live alone. That's virtually unchanged since 1980.\nl Roughly one in 10 live in poverty.\nl More than eight of 10 homes headed by an older person are owned, a high since 1982 but in line with the overall growth of homeownership in the United States.\nl About 18 percent of men 65 and older were in the labor force, almost twice the rate for women.\nWhile some seniors have simply delayed retirement and others have taken the opportunity to open small businesses, many were forced back into the labor market. Most of these people took low-level administrative or service jobs, which were plentiful during the late 1990s, said Jared Bernstein, an economist with Economic Policy Institute.\nMore than 15 percent of 65-and-older employees worked in sales in 2002, the largest share of any occupation. It was followed by professional fields, like architecture or medicine, and clerical jobs.\nCongress voted in 1983 to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2027, a change which might have encouraged some older workers in the 1980s and 1990s to put off retirement even though the change didn't immediately affect them, said John Haaga, a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau, a research group.\nOther reasons cited by Haaga: People are living longer, healthier lives and feel like working longer, and an increasing number of women have returned to work after raising children.\nBut concerns about the solvency of Social Security, rising health care costs and the faltering economy have played roles too, Bernstein said.\nIn March, government trustees said Medicare -- the health care program for seniors -- would be insolvent by 2026, four years earlier than previously predicted, as the massive Baby Boom generation hits retirement age. Social Security's projected insolvency date is 2042.\nThe stock market swoon of recent years put a dent in many workers' retirement reserves as well, forcing some to head back to work, Bernstein said.\n\"Fluctuations in a stock market might not mean much to a younger person, but for someone retiring, cashing out in a down market is a pretty unfortunate thing to do,\" he said.\nOlder women outnumber men, live longer in poverty\nSeniors leaving work force earlier, living life longer\nWorldwide elderly population increases"

The reason for the delay: the sluggish nature of the country's economic recovery.\nA majority of the economists favor extending payroll tax cuts, current marginal income tax rates and current tax rates for dividends and capital gains for most or all taxpayers through 2013. Deep tax cuts that were passed under President George W. Bush expire at the end of December unless Congress takes action. At the center of debate: extending the cuts for everybody. or just households earning less than $250,000 a year.\nWhen it comes to making those cuts permanent, the group is more split. Nearly three quarters think the payroll tax cut should not be made permanent. The group is almost evenly split about whether to make the tax cuts on income, dividends and capital gains permanent.\nThe biggest economic worry for the group was not how much to raise taxes or how to trim the budget. The problem cited was indecision: 87 percent of the economists believe that uncertainty about what direction Washington will take is holding back the economic recovery.\nThe survey on economic policies released Monday also forecast that short-term interest rates would remain at current levels for at least another year. The results are consistent with the last NABE semiannual survey, released in March.\nA slight majority of respondents _ 59 percent _ said that current U.S. monetary policy was \"about right.\" The percentage replying that monetary policy was \"too stimulative\" fell slightly compared with the percentage that held that same view in March, while the proportion answering that policy was \"too restrictive\" edged up.\nThe economists said the Federal Reserve should not buy more bonds to support and stimulate the economy, as it has in the last few years. The survey was conducted between Aug. 2 and Aug. 24, before the Federal Reserve announced a third round of bond buying on Sept. 13.\nJust 53 percent of the economists said that the action already undertaken by the Fed, known as quantitative easing, has been a success.\nThere is also a widely shared expectation that health-care costs in the United States will account for a larger share of GDP in 10 years than they do at present, assuming that the Affordable Care Act is not repealed.\nFinally, 46 percent of the NABE panel expects that in five years, the European Monetary Union will have less than its current 17 member countries. That's down from more than 60 percent just six months ago."

Food stamp benefits led to a decline of 4.4 percent in poverty from 2000 to 2009, according to a new report from the USDA's Economic Research Service. The impact was particularly strong for children, who are more likely to live in poverty than adults. Child poverty was reduced by 15.5 percent, on average. The researchers also looked at the depth and severity of poverty, and found that severity was reduced by 21 percent. They say looking at this gives a better measure of the role of food stamps in improving the lives of Americans, compared to just a straight look at the poverty rate. In 2009, 21 percent of all children, or 15.5 million, lived in poverty. That's up from 16 percent in 2001, an increase attributed to the economic downturn. And that's including the buffering effect of food stamps. A family of four would have to earn less than $23,050 to be considered poor in 2012, according to the the Department of Health and Human Services. There's no question that a lot of people are affected by the food stamp program, which is formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Last year, 44.7 million Americans got food stamp benefits in an average month. That added up to $72 billion in benefits for the year. Food stamps figured in the presidential primaries: Republican candidate Newt Gingrich suggested the program was letting millionaires eat steak on the government's dime. Use of food stamps is indeed up in high-income zip codes, as we reported last December. But economists say that's more a factor of long-term unemployment rather than gaming the system to feast courtesy of the government. The budget plan passed by the House earlier this month would slash spending for food stamps, as well as for other federal entitlement programs.Copyright 2014 NPR. To see more, visit .

        "webpage": "Keywords City & Province\nChartered accountants can map international career By Bev Cline, Canwest News Service\nWhen Jennifer Tokarek was chosen as Ernst & Young Canada's first-ever Corporate Responsibility Fellow from Western Canada, she had no idea that her three-month work placement in Santiago, Chile would have such a positive impact on her life.\"It was absolutely fascinating to live and work in Chile,\" says the 32-year-old chartered accountant. \"I had done some travelling in high school and university and absolutely loved spending time in new places. Travelling is great, but to actually live in a culture is pretty cool, especially when you're being paid for it.\"Ernst & Young's four-year-old corporate responsibility program provides services to growing companies in developing nations. Tokarek's salary and living expenses in Chile were paid for by E&Y. Her services, which focused mainly on corporate reorganization, were provided free to trabajando.com, an Internet-based human resources company.\"The program matches CAs with high-impact entrepreneurs who are on the edge of bringing economic and social change to their local area. However, they need assistance with their business processes so that they can grow and expand,\" explains Tokarek. When Tokarek, who has been with E&Y for 10 years, arrived in Santiago, privately-owned trabajando.com had recently received massive financing for expansion. The company was set to expand operations into Peru, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. \"My role was to help the company develop an international tax strategy for investing in those countries and for repatriation of profits,\" says Tokarek, who says she gained \"an immense amount of experience in international tax\" that she brought back to her work here in Canada. The chance to combine work with international travel is top of mind for university students considering a future as a chartered accountant, says Leigh Carter, national campus recruiting leader for Ernst & Young Canada. \"Questions about travel are among the top three questions students ask,\" says Carter. \"Students want to know: What's so great about E&Y, what are the growth opportunities within the firm, and what are the global opportunities?\"I tell the students that having your CA designation is like having a fantastic international passport to the world.\"Other Ernst & Young Canada opportunities for CAs to gain international work experiences include an 18- to 24-month secondment to one of the firm's 140 offices around the world through the firm's global exchange program and the Just-In-Time Exchange to Australia. (The busy Australian tax season is opposite to that of Canada, like our contrasting meteorological seasons.) There's also potential travel through client work, since many Canadian companies have subsidiaries in other countries or are themselves a subsidiary of an multinational enterprise.The CA designation is highly portable and international exposure is highly sought-after by Canadian employers, says Mona Ghiami, director of career information for the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario (ICAO). A Vancouverite, Ghiami, who is a chartered accountant, studied at the University of British Columbia, worked in Chicago during part of her articling time and then came back north to live and work in Toronto. There are currently 33,000 members of the ICAO and approximately 2,600 are working abroad. \"Once you have gained global experience, you come back to Canada and instantly advance your career,\" says Ghiami.\"I find that many students have the travel bug,\" says Ghiami, who promotes the CA profession to high school and university students, \"They may have been exposed to travel during their student years and are looking for a way to combine work and travel during their career. \"As a CA they can fulfil this goal. In addition to working with public accounting firms, we have members working internationally in banking, industrial organizations, entrepreneurial companies, and many other different sectors. They can take their skills and work literally anywhere in the world, and then bring their newly-acquired skills back to Canada.\"As for Tokarek and her sojourn to Chile, she would advise young CAs with the urge to travel to seek out international opportunities. \"I really believe entrepreneurs drive the economy and spur innovation. In South America, for example, a significantly large portion of companies are entrepreneurial. It is very satisfying and exciting to work in a different culture and help make a real difference in the local economy.\"\u00a9 Copyright (c) E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this Article Story Tools E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this Article Font:***** Image:**** Browse Job Sectors\nAutomotive Jobs\nCommunications/Media Jobs\nContact Centre Jobs\nEngineering/Applied Science\nOil & Gas Jobs\nStudents Jobs\nTourism Jobs\nTrades Jobs\nFind more Jobs now...

        "webpage": "Vanguard Blog\nInsights and opinions from Vanguard leaders\nEmerging markets: Innocents abroad?\nPosted by Craig Stock on October 20, 2010 @ 8:56 am in Investing Mark Twain lost a couple of fortunes through bad investments, which probably explains the pungency of his comments about investing.\nSuch as: \"There are two times in a man's life when he should not speculate: when he can't afford it and when he can.\"\nI've always thought investors should keep in mind another Twain observation: \"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.\"\nJust a few years ago, legions of borrowers and investors and lenders knew \"for sure\" that there was no way U.S. housing prices could fall much, if at all. We know how that turned out. Sometimes, the things we know for sure actually are true, but the conclusions we draw from these facts are what \"just ain't so.\"\nFor example, everyone could see 10 or 12 years ago that the internet was a hugely important development in the way people were communicating, buying, and conducting business. The explosion in web-based commerce was certainly true. What just wasn't so was the belief that all this growth made investments in internet companies a sure thing.\nI wonder whether a parallel today is emerging-market stocks?\nIt's a fact that emerging-market economies are growing much faster than developed economies such as the U.S., Europe, and Japan. And these emerging economies are widely expected to continue growing faster.\nWhat doesn't necessarily follow is that more-rapid growth in emerging markets will result in higher returns from emerging market stocks. Vanguard's chief economist, Joe Davis, made this point in a recent research paper. In brief, Joe's research finds that there has been no correlation in the past between the growth rate in a given country and the performance of stocks in these countries. That finding may seem counterintuitive, but it's not so surprising when you realize that some of the economic growth in a given country is supplied by multinational firms.\nWhat makes this matter of more than academic interest is that a lot of money is flowing these days into emerging-market stocks. According to data from Vanguard and the mutual fund researchers Morningstar, 97% of the net cash flowing into international stock mutual funds over the 3 years through August 31 went into emerging markets funds - $87.9 billion out of $90.5 billion. (I cadged this fact from a research paper by my colleagues Chris Philips, Fran Kinniry, and Yan Zilbering.)\nIf the big inflows represent thoughtful decisions by investors to increase the allocation to emerging markets in their long-term investment plans, perhaps there's nothing to worry about. Indeed, analysis we've done at Vanguard underscores our belief that U.S. investors should consider an international exposure of 20% to 40% of the stock portion of their portfolios.\nBut to me it's worrisome that these flows follow several years in which emerging-market stocks have outperformed stocks in the United States or in developed international markets. We've seen such patterns many times in the past - cash flow into mutual funds tends to follow strong performance in a particular category - and the results are rarely good for investors.\nTo the extent that investors are chasing the relatively strong returns from emerging-market stocks, I hope they're not being, to borrow again from Mark Twain, Innocents Abroad.\nNote: All investments are subject to risks. Foreign investing involves additional risks including currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. Stocks of companies in emerging markets are generally more risky than stocks of companies in developed countries.\nEmailFacebookTwitterLinkedInGoogleLike  Loading...

        "webpage": "How Unemployment Has Dragged On, In Three Charts By editor\nJul 6, 2012 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Lam Thuy Vo / NPR\nOriginally published on July 9, 2012 10:06 pm Losing your job is rarely good. Not being able to find one for months can be disastrous for individuals, and bad for society as well. Yet during the recent recession and the current anemic recovery, more people in the U.S. have been unemployed for longer than at any time since 1948. Of all Americans who were unemployed in June, almost half had been without a job for 27 weeks or longer. In other words, 5.4 million people have been jobless for more than half a year. The government calls these the long-term unemployed. Experts say the longer workers are jobless, the more likely they are to lose valuable work skills. They also have a harder time re-entering the workforce than those who are jobless for shorter periods. Sure enough, the data bear this out: As of June, the number of people unemployed for less than 27 weeks had declined by about 25 percent since it peaked in October 2009. But the ranks of the long-term unemployed have declined more slowly for the same period, by about 5 percent. In other words, as unemployment comes down, the long-term unemployed aren't benefiting as much. The current recession and recovery is unusual for the sheer number of people unemployed for long periods. They haven't always made up such a large proportion of the unemployed, as shown in the chart below: As a result, on average, people today are also unemployed for much longer than they have been since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started recording this data in 1948: These figures reflect the most commonly cited measure of unemployment, excluding those who are working part time but want full-time work, and those who want a job but have given up looking.

        "webpage": "What's Hot: Social Media Compliance and Archiving for Investment Advisers\nBy Kaleigh Alessandro,Thursday, September 20th, 2012\nWhen it comes to compliance, hedge funds and investment management firms have a lot to think about. Dodd-Frank, registration, Form PF, oh my! And these days they can add one more thing to their plates: social media.\nSocial media, in the mainstream, may be a tool for chatting, researching or staying up-to-date on current events. But for investment firms, social media can be a great marketing opportunity and a way to spread their message. It must also be closely monitored, though, particularly as regulators seek to address its prevalence with archiving requirements.\nA History of Social Media in the Financial World\nEarlier this year, Goldman Sachs - one of the largest investment banks in the world - joined Twitter. It was a remarkable day, and with 132 characters (barely within the 140-character limit!), Goldman announced that it would be posting updates in the future about its work and its employees. You're probably thinking \"why so remarkable?\" The reality is that the financial services industry has traditionally steered clear of social media, worried that it would only pose problems and concerned about bodies such as the SEC reacting in an unfavorable way.\nIn 2011, MHP Communications surveyed 77 hedge fund managers about their social media activity and found that only 1 percent of firms were actively on Twitter and none were active on Facebook. According to MHP, \"the findings did not surprise us. Historically, hedge fund managers have deliberately kept a low profile and managed their reputations accordingly. They are also concerned about the regulatory implications of social media. As such, adoption of social media is extremely low.\"\nThe Legal Requirements\nWe all know that emails and instant messages are required by the SEC to be archived for five to seven years. But where do they stand on social media content? According to SEC Rule 17a-4(b), registered investment advisers and broker-dealers should archive all business communications on social media for at least three years. With discovery audits on the rise, firms should ensure these communications can be easily searched and recovered in the event of an SEC inquiry.\nDespite the requirements, social media is still a hot topic among registered investment advisers. According to the seventh annual Investment Management Compliance Testing Survey, released earlier this year, social media was the \"hottest\" compliance topic for firms, with 80 percent of RIAs stating they have adopted formal social media policies (up from 64 percent in 2011 and 43% in 2010). However, 54 percent of firms reported that their firms have prohibited the use of social media - another indication that full-scale adoption and acceptance has not yet arrived.\nWhat's Next for Social Media Compliance?\nAs investment firms continue to introduce social media into their business strategies, they must also develop written social media policies to ensure proper procedures are outlined for employees relative to acceptable and unacceptable use of social media. This will be a firm's best defense for managing an effective social media campaign. Firms will also continue to implement social media archiving tools - such as those from Global Relay, Smarsh and Hootsuite - to comply with SEC regulations, particularly as the SEC begins to administer discovery audits. The reality is that social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn have become mainstream avenues for business communication (even in financial services), and therefore, firms must work diligently and carefully to ensure they put their best foot forward whether it be via status update or tweet.\nLearn more about social media and compliance:\nHow to Implement a Social Media Policy at Your Firm\nHedge Fund Tech Compliance: Archiving, Security & Mobile Device Management\nBest Practices for Email Archiving\nPhoto Credit: Global Relay\nCategorized under: Trends We're Seeing Hedge Fund Regulation Communications Recent Posts /"

        "webpage": "Markets / FinanceForex Are You Ready for QE4?\nBy Roger Baettig on December 10 2012 3:41 PM EST\nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke\nREUTERS Despite recently launching a third round of quantitative easing, the Federal Reserve is once again expected to announce another bond buying program this week. The additional easing would replace Operation Twist, an asset purchase program where the central bank sells short-term notes to purchase long-term notes. However, its replacement will likely be outright bond buying, as the Federal Reserve is running out of short-term notes to sell.\nOnly three months ago, the Federal Reserve decided to prove it is willing to do whatever it takes to prop up asset prices. Throwing savers under the printing press again, the Federal Open Market Committee launched QE3 in September, or QE-to-infinity-and-beyond, an open-ended program to buy agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion a month. There is no set limit to how long the fresh money printing will last, but Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank is looking for sustained improvement in the labor market, and a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain even after an economic recovery strengthens. QE3 increased the Fed's long-term holdings to $85 billion each month, but $45 billion of that is scheduled to conclude at the end of this year with Operation Twist expiring.\nWith the market firmly fixed like a drug addict on quantitative easing, many believe the Federal Reserve will replace Operation Twist with another QE program, or more money printing. The FOMC meets this week, and will announce its decision on Wednesday. All signs point towards more QE. In the previous FOMC statement, released last month, the central bank explains, \"Looking ahead, a number of participants indicated that additional asset purchases would likely be appropriate next year after the conclusion of the maturity extension program in order to achieve a substantial improvement in the labor market.\" John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, recently said, \"A decision not to continue buying long-term Treasuries when Twist expires would be a surprise to markets and that would be counterproductive.\"\nThe Federal Reserve's balance sheet shows no signs of slowing down.\nQE programs not only help to juice markets higher through dollar devaluation, they expand the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to record breaking levels. The central bank's balance sheet is already nearing $3 trillion and could hit $4 trillion by the end of 2013 if more QE is announced on Wednesday. Francisco Blanch, a global investment strategist with Bank of America, believes the Federal Reserve will maintain bond purchases until the end of 2014, a move that could send the central bank's balance sheet skyrocketing to $5 trillion.\nThe exploding balance sheet at the Federal Reserve will also make it extremely difficult, if not impossible for the central bank to exit its current monetary easing stance. \"There is certainly an issue about unwinding the balance sheet that is effective and continues to support the recovery without creating inflation,\" explains James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, according to Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase, a member on the board of directors at the New York Fed, estimates that a $40 billion QE program to replace Operation Twist will cause the Fed to be \"effectively absorbing about 90 percent of net new dollar-denominated fixed-income assets.\"\nNaturally, the Federal Reserve's massive presence in the market has caused many investors to become cautious. True safe havens such as gold and silver have outperformed the market over the past decade, as investors seek protection in an asset that can not be printed at will and has stood the test of time.\nCopyright Wall St Cheat Street All rights reserved."

        "webpage": "Risk & Compliance September 1, 2000September 1, 2000\nTop Cops of Risk\nThe rise of enterprise risk management has spawned a new corporate executive: Chief Risk Officer.\nMichael Hofmann's job didn't exist in January. In February, Hofmann became the first chief risk officer (CRO) of Wichita-based Koch Industries Inc., a privately held diversified energy company. His title gives him oversight responsibility for several risk-related areas that had previously been kept separate, from property-and-casualty exposures to foreign-currency exchange, commodity price fluctuations, credit risks, and reputational exposures.\n\"My job is to pull it all together,\" he says.\nThe new CRO joins a small but growing list of executives occupying this emerging corporate position. Chief risk officers aren't exactly taking the business world by storm, but they are finding a niche as companies migrate toward enterprise risk management, the activity taking up much of Hofmann's time. \"We're building the capability internally to identify all risks, analyze and quantify them, and then determine the optimum means of mitigating, absorbing, or transferring them,\" he explains.\nEnterprise risk management veers sharply from traditional risk management, in which different company departments are given the task of managing different risks. The custom is for insurance risk managers to mitigate property-and-casualty exposures, treasurers to run herd on finance risks, internal audit to manage compliance issues, desk traders to hedge market risks, and so on. Rarely is there any sharing of risk knowledge or strategy in this so-called silo approach. Not only do these overseers analyze risks differently, they often use different tools for risk transfer  -  a mix of traditional insurance, counterparty trades, derivatives, and alternative risk-transfer methods.\nEven the jargon differs from silo to silo. That's why Hofmann sees a common language for risk as indispensable to enterprise risk management.\n\"At this point, we're working to apply our state-of-the-art trading-risk framework to all other aspects of our business by using common definitions of risk and a common way to measure or quantify risks,\" he says. \"When that's done, we will decide on an ongoing basis which risks to keep and which to transfer. Then we can effect the transfer through our trading desks, financial markets, insurance carriers, integrated risk policies, OTC [over-the-counter] transactions, or a contractual transfer to another party entirely.\" Pulling all this together will take at least two years, he estimates.\nHofmann isn't alone in his endeavor. Regulatory pressures, particularly capital adequacy, allocation, and accountability issues, are compelling many companies to get a firmer handle on risk. A number of those companies are designating CROs or forming multidisciplinary risk oversight committees to effect enterprise risk management strategies. By managing the entire risk portfolio under one umbrella, they ensure that a rigorous, consistent risk management process is applied throughout the entire organization.\nTearing Down Walls\nWhile Hofmann is building this capability internally, other CROs are working closely with insurance brokers, accounting firms, and risk management consultants to lead the way, a process that generally takes at least two years to reach fruition. The effort is worth it, advocates say. By tearing down the walls separating the management of risks, CROs have discerned undue risk concentrations within the portfolio of risk  -  exposures that may seem small on an individual basis but are dangerous in sum.\nVerizon Finds Nine Kinds of Cyber Risk Cash Flow"

        "webpage": "FDIC acts to bolster dwindling reserves\nFederal regulators yesterday proposed raising an additional $45 billion from the nation's banks to help rebuild the fund that insures customer deposits as an increasing number of failures threaten to drain the fund's reserves.\nThe board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. voted unanimously to seek public comment on a plan to have banks prepay the next three years of premiums into the agency's Deposit Insurance Fund. The fund, which insures bank accounts up to $250,000 in case a bank fails, is paid through assessments on financial institutions.\nBut the financial crisis and deep recession have caused the fund to drop below its mandated level as it has paid to cover deposits at failed banks. So far this year, 94 banks have failed. The FDIC now projects bank failures through 2013 could cost an additional $100 billion, up sharply from the $70 billion projected in May.\nIf no action is taken, the FDIC projects the fund would run out of cash in the first three months of next year.\nThe FDIC could raise more money for the fund by increasing the preiums that banks pay. But it has already done that once this year and regulators are concerned about how another increase would affect the struggling banking industry. And the FDIC is hesitant to tap a line of credit with the Treasury Department because of concerns about a public backlash to more taxpayer money going to help banks.\nSo FDIC chairwoman Sheila C. Bair proposed that the agency essentially get an advance from the banks by having them prepay three years of assessments. Banks will be able to write off the expense quarterly, spreading the cost over the three years.\nBair stressed that the fund remains solid and that bank deposits continue to be \"100 percent safe.\" She noted the fund is backed by the U.S. government, but that she did not want to turn to that option yet.\n\"It's clear that the American people would prefer to see an end to policies that look to the federal balance sheet as a remedy for every problem,\" Bair said. \"In choosing this path, it should be clear to the public that the industry will not simply tap the shoulder of the increasingly weary taxpayer.\" The public will have 30 days to comment on the proposal.\nBair didn't rule out the possibility of the FDIC tapping its $500 billion credit line with the Treasury Department, if the economy unexpectedly worsened. \"But today is not that day,\" she said before the vote.\nThe deficit partly reflects higher reserves the FDIC has set aside for anticipated bank failures. At the same time, the balance of cash and assets of failed banks that can be sold by the FDIC remain positive, the agency said.\nAn emergency insurance fee on banks, which took effect June 30, brought in around $5.6 billion. Another one would allow the healthiest banks to keep more capital for investment, but could drive weaker banks toward failure, further depleting the insurance fund.\nThe American Bankers Association praised the FDIC proposal, saying it was better than increasing the insurance assessment that banks pay. The group noted that banks will pay almost $17 billion into the fund in assessments this year, including a $5.6-billion increase in the second quarter.\n\"Another special assessment would likely do more harm than good as it would directly reduce bank income, hinder capital growth, and make lending much more difficult,\" said James Chessen, the group's chief economist.\n -  Los Angeles Times"

        "webpage": "Vital lesson in financial literacy\nBook seeks to teach basics to Grade 10s\nEmail Manitoba students will receive a more enhanced education in financial literacy with the latest edition of a book called Money and Youth: A Guide to Financial Literacy available to every Grade 10 student in the province. The 15th edition of the book was launched Wednesday at an event at Westwood Collegiate. KEN GIGLIOTTI / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Gary Rabbior of the Canadian Foundation for Economic Education presents copies of the latest edition of the financial-literacy books to students at Westwood Collegiate Wednesday. Photo Store Produced by the Canadian Foundation for Economic Education (CFEE), the initiative receives significant support from Winnipeg-based Investors Group and Manitoba's Department of Education. Gary Rabbior, president of the CFEE, said Manitoba is a leader in the field and other provinces are now using the Manitoba model, which is starting to include an enhanced financial literacy curriculum for grades 4 to 12. Since the CFEE was formed 15 years ago, 300,000 copies of the guide have been distributed to students across the country whenever requested. This is the first time -- and the only province -- where every student in a particular grade will receive the book. Murray Taylor, president of Investors Group, said he and his company are passionate about its support of the CFEE and has been a key partner in the distribution of the 200-page guide for many years. \"We come across this all the time,\" he said about the lack of financial literacy and the fact many people have never had the chance to learn it. \"We find it really makes a difference in thinking through a budget and doing financial planning. The more young people can be skilled in that area, the better.\" Taylor said research has shown limiting that instruction to \"consumer\" math classes is not the best approach. His company has helped hook the CFEE up with the Department of Education in Manitoba, which is in the process of doing pilot projects with 30 teachers in three school divisions in grades 4 to 7 to sprinkle financial-literacy components into social studies, English and geography classes. Aileen Najduch, assistant deputy minister of education, said Investors Group has partnered with the province to access the best material to use to teach the material. \"It's all about having good resources to work with,\" she said. \"Teachers are happy to include the content but they want relevant, engaging material to help them meet curriculum outcomes.\" Rabbior said the CFEE continues to experience support from teachers, school boards, parents and, most importantly, the students themselves. \"Kids are facing more money decisions and they have access to more money than they used to,\" Rabbior said. \"And the opportunities to make mistakes are greater and the consequences of mistakes are greater. For instance, if you make a mistake at an early age, that effects your credit rating or reputation, it can be a legacy that will have an impact for a long time.\" Aaron Ryback, a Grade 12 student at Westwood Collegiate, said he has appreciated the financial-literacy components in his Grade 12 math class. He realizes his parents aren't going to pay for everything as he gets older. \"I just bought a vehicle,\" he said. \"I know I have to pay for gas and insurance and I have to save up for that. That means I can't go out for lunch every day with friends and blow money on things I don't need.\" The book and accompanying website are also designed to be an excellent tool for parents to be able to play a bigger role in teaching their children about money.

        "webpage": "Research and Commentary: Laffer and the Marketplace Fairness Act Logan Pike - August 1, 2013 Heartland Institute\nOn July 18, economist Arthur Laffer released a study titled \"Pro-Growth and E-Fairness,\" in which he supports the Marketplace Fairness Act. Commonly known as the Internet sales tax, MFA has passed in the U.S. Senate and awaits action in the House of Representatives.\nCurrently, under a longstanding \"physical presence standard,\" states can force to collect sales tax only those businesses that have a physical presence such as a store, factory, or warehouse within their borders. MFA would overturn the physical presence standard and allow states to force out-of-state businesses to collect and remit sales tax to the state in which the customer resides.\nLaffer and other proponents of Internet sales taxes say MFA would close a loophole and \"jumpstart economic growth across the country\" by allowing states to lower income taxes and other levies.\nOpponents point out it is unlikely states would lower other taxes. Revenue-neutrality is not states' goal, they note, but rather revenue increases. To date only three governors have pledged to cut other taxes if their states are allowed to collect sales taxes from out-of-state retailers, and nothing in MFA requires tax cuts to offset additional sales tax revenue from Internet shoppers. U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) responded to Laffer's study by saying, \"other states certainly wouldn't do anything to keep tax revenue neutral, and local governments would be even less likely to do so.\"\nKatie McAuliffe, federal affairs manager at Americans for Tax Reform and executive director of Digital Liberty, says there is no online sales tax loophole: \"All businesses collect and remit sales tax for sales made within the states where they are physically present. States have a use tax which they have not adequately tried to collect.\" She adds, \"The major issue is the precedent this legislation sets for states to tax beyond their physical borders.\" McAuliffe says this precedent could be used to justify business activity taxes or business income taxes on out-of-state firms.\nEliminating the physical presence standard would be a dangerous extension of state power into other states. It also would subject retailers to taxation without representation by forcing them to comply with sales tax rules of states in which they have no vote. John Nothdurft, director of government relations at The Heartland Institute, says MFA would be a \"massive expansion of taxing authority that could open the door to a Pandora's Box of other new taxes.\" The following documents provide further information about Laffer's \"Pro-Growth and E-Fairness\" study and the Marketplace Fairness Act.\nResearch & Commentary: Marketplace Fairness Act  Institute Senior Policy Analyst Matthew Glans encourages Congress and state legislators to \"implement a sales tax system based on where the product was sold, known as an origin-based tax system,\" in order to level the playing field.\nConservatives Should Run, Not Walk, Away from So-Called 'Marketplace Fairness Act'"

The depth of Spain's banking crisis was exposed late last week after the government announced a \u20ac19 billion rescue of one of the nation's top lenders, Bankia.\nThe move raised worries that Spanish banks face larger-than-expected losses on bad loans stemming from the collapse of the nation's housing bubble.But the Spanish government does not have the money to bail out the entire banking sector, which analysts say could cost upwards of \u20ac100 billion. Madrid has already warned that it will miss its targets for deficit reduction this year.The combination of mounting losses in the banking sector and the government's limited financial resources has raised fears Spain may need to be rescued. \"Spain is now seemingly drifting inexorably to a bailout of one sort or other,\" said Emily Nicol, an economist Daiwa Capital Markets.In the markets, yields on Spanish bonds have increased as investors demand higher interest rates to assume the lending risk.The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds rose to a high of 6.68% this week. That's approaching the level that ultimately led to bailouts for other struggling euro area nations, such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal.Spain should let its small banks failWhile Spain is not on the verge of insolvency, the government cannot afford to pay interest rates at current levels for very long.Spanish economy minister Luis de Guindos warned this week that current yields are \"not very sustainable over the long term,\" according to reports.In addition to the banks, Spain is potentially on the hook for the debts of several regional governments. On Thursday, ratings agency Fitch downgraded eight Spanish autonomous communities, citing larger-than-expected deficits and rising borrowing costs. The European Union has increased its crisis resources, but the cost to bail out Spain could quickly burn through the region's firewall. The European Stability Mechanism, a bailout fund that comes into effect this summer, will be equipped with \u20ac500 billion. But the Spanish government has about \u20ac800 billion in outstanding debt, said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo Securities.0:00\n/01:34Europeans' love-hate affair with the EU\"The question with Spain is do they help shore up banks or bail out the sovereign,\" said Bryson. \"There's probably not enough political will in Europe to do both.\"EU officials could allow the ESM to lend directly to banks, which would take some of the pressure off of the Spanish government to recapitalize the banks. But it remains to be seen if Germany, which has resisted expanding the bailout fund's powers, will back the idea.The European Central Bank is also under pressure to intervene on Spain's behalf.On Thursday, ECB president Mario Draghi criticized policymakers in Spain for underestimating the problems in the banking sector, particularly the cost of rescuing Bankia.More spending won't rescue Europe's six big spendersDraghi said the Spanish authorities were reluctant to admit the full scale of the banking crisis, which he said made things worse.\"There is a first assessment, then a second, a third, a fourth,\" Draghi said. \"This is the worst possible way of doing things. Everyone ends up doing the right thing, but at the highest cost.\" The ECB has already funneled more than \u20ac1 trillion into the banking system by offering low-cost, long-term loans.The flood of liquidity helped bring down borrowing costs for euro area governments, including Spain and Italy, as banks in those countries bought billions of euros worth of government debt.But some analysts say the central bank policy has exposed banks in Spain to potential liabilities if the government is forced to restructure its debts.Goldman says it can profit from Europe's bustMeanwhile, Spain is also struggling to overcome deep economic challenges as the government imposes additional austerity measures. Spain slipped back into a recession in the first quarter, and unemployment stands at nearly 25% nationwide. The unemployment rate in Spain is equivalent to that of the United States at the depths of the Great Depression, said Steven Kyle, a professor of economics at Cornell.\"Even if Spain had a functioning and healthy financial system, it would still be in the midst of a Great Depression,\" said Kyle.

They seek a positive annual return (the higher the better), limited swings in value, and, above all else, capital preservation. They do so by using the best of what modern financial science can provide - rapid price discovery; massive mathematical and statistical processing; risk measurement and control techniques; and leverage and active trading in corporate equities, bonds, foreign exchange, futures, options, swaps, forwards, and other derivatives.\nBecause of their nature, hedge funds are restricted to large-scale investors. Historically, they have attracted high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors, and the array of the latter has widened significantly in recent years to include pension funds, charities, universities, endowments, and foundations. Funds of funds are starting to introduce hedge funds to retail markets, but on a rather limited scale. Currently, there are about 8,500 hedge funds operating worldwide, managing over $1 trillion in assets. Quite a leap from the 2,800 hedge funds, managing $2.8 billion in assets in 1995, not to mention the amounts involved in the earliest hedge fund-type investments in the days of Aristotle (see Box 1).\nIt all began with olives\nThe first recorded hedge fund-style investment was a \"call option\" trade and appears to have occurred about 2,500 years ago. Aristotle told the story of a poor philosopher, Thales, who proved to doubters that he had developed a \"financial device, which involves a principle of universal application,\" by making a profit from negotiating with owners of olive presses for the exclusive rights to use their equipment in the upcoming harvest. Olive press owners were happy to pass on the risks of future olive prices and to accept payment now as a hedge against a bad harvest later. As it turns out, Thales correctly predicted a bountiful harvest, and the demand for oli"

Higher interest rates and increased reserve requirements enacted by the central bank last October have lowered the annual inflation rate to about 100 percent, according to Dan Pascariu, chairman of the Romanian Bank of Foreign Trade. In 1993, inflation neared 300 percent.\n\nPresident Ion Iliescu's government has eliminated subsidies on consumer goods and plans to restructure or close inefficient state-owned companies, Mr. Pascariu says. ``My personal opinion is that we have bottomed out.''\n\nSome economic indicators support this view. Overall gross domestic product grew by 1 percent last year, compared with a 15 percent drop in 1992, according to the National Statistics Commission. Agricultural production jumped 12.4 percent, testimony to the successful government policy of returning farmland to its original owners.\n\nInternational agencies and foreign governments have rewarded Romania's good-faith efforts. The country recently became an associate member of the European Union, the first step toward full membership. It inked an agreement with the International Monetary Fund that could free up to $700 million in badly needed loans over the next 18 months, provided it speeds up privatization and liberalizes the exchange rate. The United States agreed last year to pump $50 million into Romania for private-sector investment, and to renew the country's most-favored-nation trade status.\n\nBut despite these positive trends, Romanians continue to suffer. Unemployment, now at 10 percent, is expected to leap dramatically with large-scale privatization and restructuring. Real wages have dropped by about 45 percent since 1989. The average monthly salary is $60, about one-third the Czech level.\n\n``Under Ceausescu, we had enough to eat but no freedom. Now, we have freedom but not enough to eat,'' says Aurelian Manea, a Bucharest taxi driver. Indeed, long lines for bread still snake out of some stores. Markets generally sell stewed fruits, pickled vegetables, and goat cheese, but little else.\n\nMore worrisome is the government's commitment to free markets, says Christian Suicu, foreign editor of the popular Bucharest daily Romania Libera. The ruling party will jettison economic reform as soon as unemployment jumps and its popularity falls, he says. Romania will likely fall further behind the West and find itself, along with Bulgaria, relegated to Europe's ``second-teir.''\n\n``The only ones benefiting from the market economy are members of the old regime,'' adds parliamentary deputy Nicolae Ionescu-Galbeni of the opposition National Peasant Christian Democratic Party."

        "webpage": "RUDI DORNBUSCH\nSYNOPSIS: I just learned that Rudi Dornbusch has died. He had been ill for a long time, but it's still hard to believe.\nI'll probably want to say more in a more carefully thought-out post, but this is for those who want some sense of who he was and why he mattered.\nRudi was, first of all, the economist who brought international monetary economics into the modern world. The workhorse of pre-Dornbusch open-economy macro, the Mundell-Fleming model, was a fine thing, and is still the first thing most of us reach for when we need to ask what happens when you cut interest rates or increase spending. But it didn't capture the volatility of a floating-exchange-rate world, the way currencies can soar or plunge not because big things have already happened, but because big things are expected to happen.\nRudi's famous \"overshooting\" paper changed all that; it led you into a world in which today's exchange rate is mainly determined by what people think will happen in the future. He also made the crucial point that the lags in the exchange rate's effect on the real economy were what made it possible for the rate to bounce around as much as it does. The specific scenario of overshooting that he used to put the model through its paces hasn't turned out to be that big a story in real life - but the mark of a really seminal insight in economics is that it outlasts the specifics of the original question, and Rudi's \"Expectations and exchange rate dynamics\" has met that test a thousandfold.\nThere was much more to Rudi's academic career than that, of course. My particular favorite was his 1977 paper with Fischer and Samuelson about the Ricardian trade model - two centuries of international economics, compressed into a single luminous paper. But let me move on.\nThe second key thing about Rudi was that he was one of the great economics teachers of all time. He attracted the best and the brightest students at MIT at a time when MIT had the best and brightest anywhere - and he attracted quite a few who took the Red Line down from Harvard too. Some influential teachers turn their students into Mini-mes, diminished clones of themselves; Rudi had the knack of inspiring students to pick up his enthusiasm and technique, but find their own paths. In my generation almost everyone in macro or international who has since risen to some reputation was a Rudi Dornbusch student - I'm afraid to start naming them because I'm sure I'll make some crucial omission. And let's not forget that Rudi trained a lot of reformist future finance ministers, too.\nLastly, Rudi largely invented the modern role of academic economist as active policy participant. I know that's unfair to some older economists, but the way Rudi moved back and forth between cutting edge analysis and concrete, detailed advice to countries was, I believe, something pretty new. The only negative was that his ability to function happily on 3 hours' sleep, and to get those 3 hours sitting up, at any time of day, set a precedent that I at least could never match.\nHow can I summarize Rudi's influence? When I first got into international economics, in the early 1970s, it was a pretty dreary field - one in which too many academics were ivory-tower types preoccupied with doctrinal issues, and one notably lacking in Americans - we didn't think relations with other countries were important. By the 1980's international was an exciting field, in which innovative theory and current policy issues interacted, and it was a field that attracted many of the best young American economists. And the single biggest reason for that change was Rudi Dornbusch.\nOriginally published on the Official Paul Krugman Site, 7.26.02"

Laffer and Stephen Moore\nA VITAL ROAD MAP TO HELP OUR COUNTRY REGAIN ITS LOST PROSPERITY!With the economy flat on its back, unemployment at a twenty-five-year high, and the housing default crisis still worsening, is it even possible to turn our financial problems around? Economic icon Arthur B. Laffer and journalist Stephen Moore believe America can once again become the land of economic opportunity, and this brilliant new book tells us exactly how. In their rousing clarion call against the government's current fiscal strategies, The End of Prosperity, the authors focused on how lowering taxes will promote economic growth. Now, they detail the other crucial components. Simply put, the keys to prosperity are low, flat-rate taxes; government spending restraint; sound and stable money; free trade; and minimal regulation. This book gives concrete proposals on how to return to prosperity using common sense principles of good economic behavior. While most of the proposed solutions to our economic decline are fraught with peril, Return to Prosperity provides a refreshing counterbalance - a prescription for the fundamental tools America needs in order to set out on the road to recovery.

        "webpage": "US poverty rate unchanged; record numbers persist\nRelated Media WASHINGTON (AP) - The ranks of America's poor remained stuck at record levels, although dwindling unemployment benefits and modest job gains helped stave off what experts had predicted would be the fourth rise in a row in the poverty rate. With joblessness persistently high, the gap between rich and poor increased in the last year, according to two major census measures. Also, the median, or midpoint, household income was $50,054, 1.5 percent lower than 2010 and a second straight decline. A Census Bureau report released Wednesday provides a mixed picture of the economic well-being of U.S. households for 2011, when the unemployment rate improved to 8.9 percent from 9.6 percent in the previous year. The numbers are coming out not long before the Nov. 6 election in which the economy is the No. 1 issue and President Barack Obama is trying to make the case that the labor market, while not fully healed, is on the right track. The overall poverty rate stood at 15 percent, statistically unchanged from the 15.1 percent in the previous year. The rate was better than a consensus estimate of demographers who had predicted, based on weak wage growth, a gain of up to half a percentage point, to levels not seen since 1965. For last year, the official poverty line was an annual income of $23,021 for a family of four. By total numbers, roughly 46.2 million people remained below the poverty line, unchanged from 2010. That figure was the highest in more than half a century when records were kept. The 15 percent poverty rate was basically unchanged from 1993 and was the highest since 1983. Broken down by state, New Mexico had the highest share of poor people, at 22.2 percent, according to rough calculations by the Census Bureau. It was followed by Louisiana, the District of Columbia, South Carolina, Arkansas and Georgia. On the other end of the scale, New Hampshire had the lowest, at 7.6 percent. \"This is good news and a surprise,\" said Sheldon Danziger, a University of Michigan economist who closely tracks poverty. He pointed to a continuing boost from new unemployment benefits passed in 2009 that gave workers up to 99 weeks of payments after layoffs and didn't run out for many people until late 2011. Also, job gains in the private sector that helped offset cuts in state and local government workers. \"It would indicate the stimulus was even more effective than believed,\" he said. Bruce D. Meyer, an economist at the University of Chicago, said it was disappointing that poverty levels did not improve. He described it as a sign of lingering problems in the labor market even with recent declines in unemployment. \"The drop in the unemployment rate has been due in significant part to workers leaving the labor force, because they are discouraged, back in school, taking care of family or other reasons,\" he said. The official poverty level is based on a government calculation that includes only income before tax deductions. It excludes capital gains or accumulated wealth, such as home ownership. As a result, the official poverty rate takes into account the effects of some stimulus programs passed in 2009, such as unemployment benefits, as well as jobs that were created or saved by government spending. It does not factor in noncash government aid such as tax credits and food stamps. David Johnson, the chief of the Census Bureau's household economics division, attributed the better-than-expected poverty numbers to increases in full-time workers over the last year. He also estimated that expanded unemployment benefits helped keep 1.6 million working-age people out of poverty. Social Security also lifted roughly 14.5 million seniors above the poverty line. Without those cash payments, the number of people ages 65 and older living in poverty would have increased five-fold, he said. Johnson also noted that that income inequality was widening. He said the top 1 percent of wage earners had a 6 percent increase in income over the last year, while income at the bottom 40 percent of earners was basically unchanged. \"A lot of the increase is driven by changes at the very top of the distribution,\" he said. The share of Americans without health coverage fell from 16.3 percent to 15.7 percent, or 48.6 million people. It was the biggest decline in the number of uninsured since 1999, boosted in part by increased coverage for young adults under the new health care law that allows them to be covered under their parents' health insurance until age 26. Congress passed the health overhaul in 2010 to address the rising numbers of uninsured people. During this election year, the law has come under increasing criticism Republicans, including presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has pledged to push a repeal if he is elected. The main provisions of the health care law will not take effect until 2014. ___ Online: Census report:  Join the Conversation\nThe Nevada Appeal Updated Sep 12, 2012 01:28PM Published Sep 12, 2012 01:27PM Copyright 2012 The Nevada Appeal.

        "webpage": "U.S. Social Security for Mexicans?\n1/14/2003 12:00:00 AM - Phyllis Schlafly\nSocial Security, the so-called \"third rail\" of American politics, has just become more incendiary. The Bush administration is proposing a change that is even more controversial than offering younger workers the opportunity to invest a small percentage of their Social Security taxes.\nEverybody knows that Social Security is facing a massive shortfall in a few years when the baby-boom generation starts to retire. Higher taxes, reduced benefits or allowing some measure of privatization are the alternatives that need to be worked out by bipartisan consensus.\nThe Bush administration has just thrown a monkey wrench into a harmonious solution. A deal is in the works to add to the bulging Social Security rolls many thousands of Mexicans who are working in the United States, both legally and illegally. This idea would be very costly to U.S. taxpayers. It's bad politics, it undermines the rule of law and it invites a new wave of illegals to come across our border in search of taxpayer benefits. Vicente Fox's success as Mexico's president is threatened by his country's terrible poverty. So he has a very ambitious plan to deal with it: export his poverty to the United States.\nFox encourages poor and desperate Mexicans to risk all kinds of hardships to cross the U.S. border illegally, often paying their life savings to a criminal \"coyote,\" making a deal to transport illegal drugs or enduring life-threatening thirst in the Arizona desert. Fox even toyed with a plan to give them survival kits to ease their pain. If the illegal aliens manage to elude U.S. border guards and escape death on the highway in crowded vans or trucks driven by inexperienced drivers, many manage to land in various locations far away from Mexico, such as Colorado, Iowa or Georgia. They can then hope to get hired by a U.S. employer willing to close his eyes to how they got so far away from home.\nNevertheless, the illegals are told by Fox and other Mexican officials to \"think Mexican\" first and send as much as they can scrape out of their pitiful paychecks back to relatives in Mexico. According to a Pew Hispanic Center and Inter-American Development Bank report, Mexicans in the United States will send $13 billion this year to relatives in Mexico.\nAs soon as George W. Bush was elected president, Fox started pressuring him to legitimize the status of some 10 million illegal aliens who are in the United States, plus give amnesty to many illegals by reviving a loophole in an immigration law called 245(i). Those plans were sailing briskly until Sept. 11, the day that the American people woke up to the dangers of open borders, and Fox was forced to move to an incrementalist strategy.\nMexican consulates in the United States started issuing an identification card, called matricula consular, to Mexicans illegally living in our country. By definition, this card should prove that the holder is in the United States illegally, but it began to be accepted by police, banks and even driver's license offices in some states as though it were a valid ID. New York state and New York City, however, citing security reasons, just announced that they will not recognize the matricula consular as a valid identity card.\nThe deputy White House press secretary has just confirmed that the Social Security Administration has begun discussions with Mexico about an agreement to allow Mexicans to receive U.S. Social Security benefits. One plan is to allow Mexicans who were not employed in the United States long enough to collect U.S. Social Security benefits to count the time they worked in Mexico as part of the mandatory 10 years or 40 quarters.\nThe most expensive plan is to provide benefits to the estimated 5 million Mexicans who are working illegally in the United States after having supplied fake Social Security numbers to their employers.\n\"Our actuaries are working on the numbers,\" said Social Security spokesman Jim Courtney.\nAcquiescing to Fox's demands would put hundreds of thousands of Mexicans onto the rolls of the U.S. Social Security system just as the first wave of baby boomers starts getting retirement checks. Already there is talk of an addition to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City to handle 37,000 claims anticipated in the first year.\nThe Bush administration claims that these plans would promote \"totalization\" of U.S. and Mexican retirement systems and develop a positive relationship between the two countries. But offering Social Security benefits to people who knowingly violate U.S. immigration laws would create a powerful new incentive for more illegals to enter the United States. If foreigners work legally in the United States and pay Social Security taxes, they are entitled to receive the benefits they earned. But U.S. taxpayers should say \"no\" to Mexico's attempt to shift its social welfare burdens onto the U.S. taxpayers."

Carr\nIllustration by Lars LeetaruIn the popular psychology of business, the modern company is cloven. There's the organization's creative right brain  -  the restless, ragtag collection of product developers, researchers, marketers, and technologists who dream big dreams and think in the future tense. And then there's the rational left brain  -  the financial analysts, accountants, and controllers who crunch the numbers and balance the books, their vision reaching only so far as the end of the current quarter. The former are innovation's freewheeling champions; the latter are its risk-fearing enemies.\nIt's a tidy little dichotomy, but it's all wrong. It ignores the fact that business innovation is less a matter of invention than of synthesis. The greatest breakthroughs are made by those with the broadest perspectives and the deepest knowledge  -  the ones who not only can see the potential in a new technology or design but also understand the economics of production and distribution, the dynamics of supply and demand, the motivations of competitors, and the needs and caprices of consumers. And that capacity  -  what might be called, a little clumsily, analytical creativity  -  is much more likely to be found among the suits than the turtlenecks.\nThese thoughts are inspired by the new book They Made America (Little, Brown and Company, 2004), a grand tour of the world-shaping business innovations of the last 250 years, by Harold Evans, the renowned journalist (and former strategy+business columnist). Sir Harold tells, among many other instructive tales, the little-known story of Samuel Insull. A starched English bean counter who became Thomas Edison's most indispensable partner, Insull took care of all the business details that Edison couldn't be bothered with  -  the financing, the operations, the hirings and firings, the mergers. With a deft combination of discipline and daring, he sowed the seeds of what is now one of the world's very largest companies, General Electric.\nBut Insull's greatest achievement came after he left Edison's employ and, in 1892, journeyed from New York to Chicago to become the president of a tiny electricity producer. The move baffled Insull's associates. How could he give up the helm of Edison's empire in order to lead Chicago Edison, an unaffiliated backwater company with three little generators and a paltry 5,000 customers?\nBut Insull saw something the rest missed  -  something that would not only lead to the creation of one of the most dominant businesses America has ever seen, but also change the lives of nearly every citizen in the land.\nLighting Many BulbsWhen Insull went to Chicago, electricity was very much a luxury good. Produced in small, coal-fired power plants scattered through big cities, electricity, by virtue of its high cost, was used only by prosperous companies and rich citizens. Even the wealthiest burghers couldn't afford to turn on the juice for long. They outfitted their chandeliers to run on both electricity and gas. When guests arrived, they switched on the lightbulbs; when guests departed, they cut the current and went back to burning the much cheaper gas flames. No one in the electricity business saw any alternative to this arrangement  -  or even the need for an alternative.\nNo one, that is, except Insull. Having studied both the technology and the economics of electricity generation, he was the first to realize that electricity could be a cheap, mass-market product. The cost could be driven down by centralizing production in large generating plants and distributing the power to far-flung customers via alternating current rather than the traditional but less transportable direct current. Taking a huge risk in pursuing his vision, Insull installed a massive 5,000-kilowatt turbine, the first of its kind, in a new Chicago plant.\nPage 1 2 3 | All | Next Last> E-Mail\nLooking Outward with Big Data: A Q&A with Tom DavenportFourteen Interview Questions to Help You Hire Your Next InnovatorBest of Multimedia: Bitcoin's Turbulent HistoryBuilding a Megaproject Without the Mega ProblemsNo More Business as UsualFour Tips for Walking Your Innovation TalkMuckraking Is Alive and WellHow to Prepare Your Company for GrowthThe Vicious Cycle of CEO Pet ProjectsThe Trouble with Sunspots Previous"

        "webpage": "Onlookers say fiscal cliff deal offers some encouragement to business owners\nThe fiscal cliff deal struck in Congress raises income tax rates for single taxpayers making more than $400,000 and married couples earning above $450,000  -  and many of these wealthy taxpayers are small-businesses owners. But by putting an end to the uncertainty over future tax rates, the deal could encourage businesses to invest, expand and hire more workers, experts said.\nStill, there are new clouds on the horizon: in a few weeks, Congress is expected to embark on deficit reduction, with spending cuts that could dampen economic activity.\"With some stability, business owners can now make business decisions,\" said Alan D. Sobel, managing member of Sobel & Co., in Livingston. \"What really interferes with making decisions is uncertainty  -  people become paralyzed and sit on the sidelines. So my sense is that now that there is some element of certainty  -  at least, as it relates to income taxes  -  business owners are going to be freed up to be able to make decisions about investments in equipment, investments in people, in opening up new markets.\"David Brogan, first vice president of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, echoed that sentiment, saying the deal \"will create a level of certainty that is necessary for any economic rebound.\" He said keeping tax rate unchanged for singles earning less than $400,000 and couples earning less than $450,000 will mean a significant number of New Jersey small businesses won't see their taxes go up; President Barack Obama's original proposal  -  to raise taxes on incomes of more than $200,000 and $250,000, respectively  -  would have done far more damage in New Jersey, Brogan said.Brogan said businesses also will be helped by the move by Congress, as part of the fiscal cliff deal, to extend bonus deprecation, which had been set to expire at the end of 2012, for another year. This allows companies to write off 50 percent of the capital investment the first year.Bob Mathers, director in the tax department at Hunter Group CPA LLC, in Fair Lawn, said the extension of the bonus depreciation rule for one year is a direct boost to business. \"We now know what's going to happen for the next 12 months. We know if we need to spend money on equipment, that we can do that and get a direct writeoff without having to spread it out over several years,\" he said. \"When Congress comes back, there will still be a lot of talk about tax reform, but least we do have some certainty for the next 12 months.\"Many companies did resolve to move forward with their business plans last year  -  buying equipment or buildings, and hiring new workers  -  regardless of what happened in Washington. Some evidence of business confidence can be seen in Small Business Administration loan demand, which was strong in 2012, when New Jersey had its third-best SBA lending year on record, according to Al Titone, state district director for the SBA.\"People just couldn't wait any more,\" he said. \"You can only sit so long on the sidelines and then basically you jump in when you think you've got an opportunity.\"Anika Khan, senior economist of Wells Fargo, said the looming cliff led businesses to \"defer a lot of their spending activity due to uncertainty.\" But the deal reached by Congress doesn't restore clarity, she said, and the end of the payroll tax holiday affects all workers, and \"is going to cause household to pull back a bit on making some of their spending decisions.\"And in a few weeks, there will be budget cuts that will impact the economy, she added. \"Until businesses get completely clear about what the economic landscape is going to look like, and what their contribution is going to have to be, they are going to continue to be on the fence.\"Pat O'Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick, said when Congress takes up federal spending, \"the ripple will be significant.\"Lawmakers, he said, must address long-term cost increases in Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid. \"If that curve is not tilted downward or reduced gradually, it becomes highly disruptive,\" O'Keefe said. \"And the rancorous brinksmanship that has characterized fiscal and tax policy for the better part of a decade always runs the risk of a catastrophic event.\"\nKarenD said:\nCongress and the White House are fighting it out in an effort to keep away from the fiscal cliff. Democrats are stingy about making cuts to entitlements, and Republicans will not take into account higher taxes. But are Americans really taxed too seriously?

They may go on to become a more successful entrepreneur than an equally smart but law-abiding classmate.\nUsing data from the March Supplements of the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, economists Ross Levine and Yona Rubinstein have written a working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research which looks for what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur in the U.S.\nThe economists found that self-employed workers with incorporated businesses were nearly three times more likely to engage in risky and illegal activities as teens than were salaried workers, who were more likely to follow the rules.\nLevine and Rubinstein separated self-employed workers who had incorporated their businesses -- a lengthy and expensive process -- from those who had not. They say that going through the process of incorporation is a better indicator of a committed entrepreneurial venture.\n\"The nature of the business tells you about the nature of the person,\" Rubinstein said.\nThe risky behaviors exhibited by those workers in their youth included but wasn't limited to shoplifting, marijuana use and skipping school all the way up to drug dealing and assault.\nSelf-employed workers with incorporated businesses also scored higher on learning aptitude tests, were more educated, exhibited greater self esteem and were more likely to come from high-earning two-parent families.\n\"Of course, you have to be smart,\" Levine said. \"But it's a unique combination of breaking rules and being smart that helps you become an entrepreneur.\" It's worth noting that risky and illicit behavior overall does not indicate a high probability of successful entrepreneurship.\nThe authors also say that the tendency for successful entrepreneurs to come from wealthier families may indicate the relative ease with which they can raise capital.\nThe downside to possessing both risk-taking tendencies and high self-esteem, the authors say, is that successful entrepreneurs are vulnerable to severe lapses in judgment.\nStill, overall, the authors conclude that entrepreneurship still pays in America. Separating self-employed workers into incorporated and unincorporated categories, they say, dramatically changes the comparison with wage and salaried workers. The unincorporated self-employed, they say, earn much less than their salaried counterparts.\nEgypt: Muslim Brotherhood torches government headquarters\nBaghdad car bombs kill 33, dozens injured\nWendy Davis poses for Vogue spread\nMarijwhatnow?

        "webpage": "Republican Sellout Invites Stagflation\nWhile it may not be a surprise that the Republicans are preparing to yield on their vow to oppose tax hikes, it should raise investor concerns the world over that an upcoming budget agreement will likely involve a Congressional surrender of its authority to set the federal debt ceiling. In exchange for this, it appears that the Republicans have simply done nothing to halt, or even curb, the dangerous federal spending trajectories or the current drift towards greater state control of the economy. President Obama has politically outmaneuvered the Republicans, even going as far as evoking the Newtown massacre as a reason for quickly concluding a deal. As a result, it is likely that the GOP will bear the blame for any breakdown in fiscal cliff negotiations. They could wear such an outcome as a badge of honor, but nothing indicates that they have the political courage to do so.\nGiven the drift in Washington, those who had hoped for a significant improvement in the United States fiscal prospects will have nothing but lumps of coal in their Christmas stockings. At the same time, the Fed continues to hold its foot to the floor with increased quantitative easing that will pump massive liquidity into the system (see Peter Schiff's: latest commentary: for more on this). The combination: can lead to: stagflation and a debased U.S. dollar.\nRepublican House Speaker John Boehner has indicated a willingness to accept new taxes of $1 trillion, despite his party's pledge to halt tax increases. Diverting a trillion dollars out of the wealth-generating private sector into the government's coffers can only hurt corporate investment, particularly the venture capital sector that is so vital to the flow of new ideas and technology that stand at the core of America's highly profitable international technological lead.\nBut far more momentous than his capitulation on taxes is his agreement to pass debt limit power to the president. This decision removes any chance that the United States will ever do anything meaningful to address its fiscal imbalances.\nFollowing the establishment of the Federal Reserve, the House of Representatives': approval of the Federal debt limit was needed to restrict a profligate government from endangering the credit of the United States and encumbering future generations with an unbearable level of debt service. But in order to pander to voters, both Republicans and Democrats have paid little heed to this important duty and have rubber-stamped continued increases in debt. In recent years, when Federal debt began exceeding GDP, Republicans finally withheld the stamp in order to force a real budget discussion. But a combination of their own hypocrisy and political mishandling has rendered those attempts futile.\nIn the meantime, both parties have avoided making any meaningful cuts in government spending and have instead offered accounting gimmickry as a poor substitute. Neither party appears willing to risk votes in order to curb the profligate and economically suicidal growth in out of control entitlement expenditures.\nLast week, The Economist magazine published a list of 80 countries, ranked in order of quality of life as determined by such elements as economic well-being, intrusive government and crime. The United States has now fallen to sixteenth position (with Switzerland in first position). The combination of $1 trillion of new taxes and the likelihood of increased financial and commercial regulation will likely push the U.S. further down the list.\nIt is time for politicians, and particularly Republicans, to put the nation before their individual careers. Should they fail in this great patriotic call, they will be sentencing their fellow Americans to a future of falling living standards, currency decline and poverty.\nBut while the US struggles with its political and economic morass, other regions of the world do present more promising opportunities for investors.

Fed Prepares to Maintain Record Balance Sheet for Years Benefits and risks of turning the Fed into one of the biggest players in global money markets.\nBy Craig Torres and Matthew Boesler, Bloomberg June 11, 2014\nFederal Reserve officials, concerned that selling bonds from their $4.3 trillion portfolio could crush the U.S. recovery, are preparing to keep their balance sheet close to record levels for years.\nCentral bankers are stepping back from a three-year-old strategy for an exit from the unprecedented easing they deployed to battle the worst recession since the Great Depression. Minutes of their last meeting in April made no mention of asset sales.\nOfficials worry that such sales would spark an abrupt increase in long-term interest rates, making it more expensive for consumers to buy goods on credit and companies to invest, according to James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nThat \"is a widespread view in parts of the Fed, I think, and in financial markets,\" Bullard said in an interview last week. While he disagrees with that perspective, it \"won the day.\"\nThe Fed is testing new tools that would allow it to keep a large balance sheet even after it raises short-term interest rates, a step policy makers anticipate taking next year. They would use these tools to drain excess reserves temporarily from the banking system.\n\"It is pretty clear they are anticipating operating in a situation with a lot of reserves and a high balance sheet for a long time,\" said former Fed governor Laurence Meyer, a co-founder of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, a St. Louis-based forecasting firm.\nThe strategy, which would make the Fed one of the biggest players in money markets, carries risks. In a time of crisis, investors could flock to safe short-term instruments created by the Fed, potentially starving the rest of the financial system of funding.\n\"The whole situation has created a lot of uncertainty,\" said Karl Haeling, head of strategic debt distribution at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in New York. \"The Fed is increasingly stepping into what had been a private-sector function.\"\nThe Fed's asset purchases have expanded its balance sheet to 25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from 6 percent at the start of 2007. Central banks from Japan to the U.K. also will have to develop strategies for operating with large portfolios. For example, the Bank of England's is 24 percent of GDP, up from about 6 percent in 2007.\nFed officials led by Chair Janet Yellen, who meet June 17-18, anticipate raising their benchmark federal funds rate next year for the first time since 2006. They will release new forecasts for the economy and the outlook for the benchmark after next week's meeting.\nStrategic Shift\nMaintaining a large balance sheet in a tightening period would mark a strategic shift for the Fed and reverse much of central banking doctrine from the 1990s and early 2000s, which favored minimal interference in the economy.\nUnder then-Chairman Alan Greenspan, the Fed targeted the fed funds rate, the cost of overnight loans among banks, and left most other interest rates to markets. Officials avoided subsidizing credit to specific industries, such as housing, to avoid opening a Pandora's Box of requests to aid other sectors.\nThat changed after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, when the central bank cut the fed funds rate almost to zero. Seeking more ways to stimulate growth, the Fed then began an effort to influence longer-term rates on home loans and other debt with purchases of longer-term Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, and housing-agency debt.\n\"Ambitious use of a central bank's balance sheet to channel credit to particular economic sectors or entities threatens to entangle the central bank in distributional politics and place the bank's independence at risk,\" Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker, one of the biggest internal critics of the policy, said in a May 13 speech.\nThe Fed's purchases created $2.54 trillion of bank reserves in excess of what lenders are required to hold against deposits. The central bank needs to tie up or extinguish that money to raise the short-term interest rate above its current range of zero to 0.25 percent.\nToward that end, Fed officials in June 2011 adopted an exit strategy that aimed to return the balance sheet to its pre-crisis size. The strategy called first for allowing the balance sheet to shrink gradually as assets matured. The Fed later would raise the short-term rate and then slowly start to sell assets, focusing on ridding the portfolio of housing debt.\n'Smallest Levels'\nThe size of the balance sheet and quantity of bank reserves were to be \"reduced to the smallest levels that would be consistent with the efficient implementation of monetary policy,\" according to minutes of the meeting.\nThe strategy started to change last June, when then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said most officials didn't favor selling the Fed's portfolio of housing debt, now valued at $1.6 trillion. Instead, the portfolio would be allowed to shrink gradually as the bonds"

        "webpage": "Potter Responds to GAO\nThe U.S. Postal Service has devised a plan to address concerns raised in April by the General Accounting Office. Postmaster general Jack Potter sent a letter last month to Rep. Dan Burton, R-IN, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, detailing his plan to follow up on actions recommended by the comptroller general. The GAO in April added the postal service to its high-risk list, which flags government programs susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. Weak business growth through the end of this fiscal year could mean a total year-end loss of $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion for the USPS. The plan, called the Comprehensive Transformation Plan, \"will provide a first step in describing our future direction and the pathway to reaching our goals,\" Potter said in his letter. Without mentioning specifics, Potter said the plan would include options for administrative and legislative changes. It would address the three key themes that the comptroller general highlighted: the financial, operational and human capital challenges that the USPS must meet to sustain its universal service mission. Most importantly, Potter said, \"the transformation plan, as the comptroller general points out, must address fundamental legislative reform.\" Potter said that the USPS is also working to improve the quality of its interactions with stakeholders. He said the USPS would continue to meet with members of Congress to learn their views and concerns. In addition, the agency will work with the Coalition to Preserve Universal Mail Service and others who also seek legislative reform to \"exchange views, develop options and advance the process.\" Comptroller general David M. Walker, speaking at a congressional hearing in April, said, \"We believe that the service's deteriorating financial situation calls for prompt, aggressive action, particularly in the areas of cutting costs and improving productivity.\" Walker and the GAO said the USPS should provide quarterly summary financial reports to Congress and the public. These reports should present detailed information for stakeholders to understand the postal service's current and projected financial condition, how its outlook might have changed since the previous quarter and its progress toward achieving the objectives in its comprehensive plan. The GAO said it would work with Congress and the USPS to help identify improvement options and continue to analyze and report to Congress on the postal service's financial condition. The USPS will discuss the broad plan with stakeholders during July and August, then provide everyone a draft of the plan by Sept. 30. Potter also said the USPS soon will post quarterly financial statements on its Web site \"similar to what publicly traded enterprises provide.\" The GAO was not the only group interested in seeing the USPS respond to the report. The senior senators with jurisdiction over postal matters sent a June 14 letter to the USPS expressly endorsing recommendations by the General Accounting Office that call for quarterly USPS financial reports to be developed. Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-CT, Fred Thompson, R-TN, Daniel Akaka, D-HI, and Thad Cochran, R-MS, further requested the USPS to provide plans on how it will \"reduce its mounting outstanding debt. We understand that the service may reach its statutory debt limit by the end of fiscal year 2003, and we believe that a plan to address this potential financial crisis is needed as soon as possible.\"\nIndustry responds to UAA mail challenge\nPostmaster Potter to catalogers: \"You got hammered\"\nGAO Says USPS Must Comply with Six-Day Provision\nScholastic to use FSC-certified paper for last Harry Potter book\nHarry Potter is magic at Amazon, Barnes & Noble\nNext Article in Direct Mail FedEx Picks Convergys for Call Center Service Support Sponsored Links"

The national pension fund may reduce its investment in stock market to avoid risks and ensure fund safety. [China Daily]\nChina's national government pension fund, the Social Security Fund (SSF), may cut its stock investments in the second half despite that it made a 9.99-percent return on equity investments during January to June, analysts said.\nSSF, which is estimated to have invested around 16 percent of its 660 billion yuan ($96.63 billlion) worth assets in stocks in the first half, may cut its share holding slightly as the market is expected to lose some of its growth momentum in the second half, they said.\nThe government pension fund had made a 9.99-percent return on equity investments in the first half, it said in a statement posted on its website on Friday. That in turn was helped mainly by the robust growth in the nation's stock market, with the Shanghai Composite Index rising by nearly 63 percent in the first half.\n\"The market performance in the second half may be more volatile than the first half due to the uncertain macroeconomic outlook, hence the SSF may cut its capital market holdings slightly,\" said Liu Mingjun, fund analyst, China Cinda Securities.\nAnalysts pointed out that the Shanghai Composite Index might hit a ceiling of around 3,500 to 3,700 points in the second half.\nRelated readings:\nSSF reports first annual loss since founding\nVolatile market chips SSF returns\nNational pension fund registers 9.99% gains in H1\nPension fund chief: China to further expand overseas investment\nBao Qing, analyst, Shanghai-based Donghai Securities, agreed with Liu, saying that SSF's better-than-expected performance in the first half and the volatility of the market in the coming months may see the fund cut its stock holdings slightly to ensure safer investment returns.\nSSF increased its holding of stocks in the fourth quarter of last year when the stock market plunged as much as 65 percent in 2008. The fund lost 6.79 percent on investments last year as the nation's stock market plunged, according to the fund's annual report.\nBut analysts pointed out that the cut might not be that significant considering SSF's role as a market stabilizer.\n\"SSF's stock holding is estimated be around 16 percent of its total portfolio in the first half, which is very low compared to some mutual funds, who invest as much as 70 percent of their portfolio in stocks,\" said Liu. \"There is not much room for a big cut,\" he said.\nSSF made a profit of 51.2 billion yuan from investing in stocks in the first half. Its assets exceeded 660 billion yuan at the end of June. The agency's holdings will rise to more than 740 billion yuan after it receives shares from listed companies under a government program, it said in Friday's statement.\nChina's Ministry of Finance published rules in June that require the transfer of 8.4 billion State-held shares in 131 listed companies to the fund. The stocks will be barred from trading for another three years after the existing lock-up periods expire.\nState-owned companies selling stock publicly for the first time after 2006 must hand over shares equivalent to 10 percent of the total offering to the nation's pension fund, according to the regulation. The move aims to fill a funding gap in retirement benefits for China's aging population and also help boost investor confidence in the stock market, the pension fund said in a recent statement.\n(For more biz stories, please visit Industries)"

        "webpage": "HomeNewsInvesting in Hedge Funds\nTweet Tweet North American managers broaden usage of equity derivatives\nWed, 13/08/2003 - 08:00 Tags : Investing in Hedge Funds\nA number of US and Canadian asset managers are integrating equity derivatives as cash alternatives, going beyond their more accustomed use of these products as instruments for executing specialised tactical operations. This is a key finding of early 2003 research by Greenwich Associates, which indicates that equity derivatives usage is evolving in a new direction. Greenwich Associates consultant Jay Bennett said: \"There has been a fundamental change in the entire institutional approach to equity derivatives\". Greenwich Associates research reveals several major shifts in the North American equity derivatives market. While traditional futures and listed options account for a total of 80 per cent of the volume traded in this market, the proportion of volume traded in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) more than doubled, from 4 per cent to 11 per cent. Much of this change can be attributed to the fact ETFs can be shorted and thus are appealing to hedge fund investors, an increasingly important component to this market. Meanwhile, the proportion of business controlled by derivatives specialists has shifted, plunging from 60 per cent in 2001 to 20 per cent this year, as the proportion controlled by portfolio managers jumped from 16 per cent to 45 per cent. How Europe compares Average equity derivatives trading volume by institution in North America rose from US$6 billion to US$7.4 billion, a 23 per cent increase. That is more significant than the 15 per cent growth concurrent Greenwich Associates research recorded in the European market. Futures are the most commonly traded product in both markets, but particularly so in Europe (72 per cent of the total equity derivatives market) compared to North America (58 per cent of the total market.) The use of vanilla OTC options is far greater in Europe, where it represents 14% of total volume, as opposed to just 5 per cent of North American volume. Consultant John Colon points to \"a marked shift in the control of equity derivatives transactions in Europe, with derivative specialists' control declining from 59% to 37%, and portfolio managers rising from 12% to almost 30%. The changeover in Europe is less complete, but the trend is clearly in the same direction.\" Electronic trading: The future isn't here yet Less than 10% of North American institutional trading volume in listed options on individual stocks and listed equity index options are being routed directly to exchanges via electronic trading systems, and only 16% of listed equity index futures are being so routed. Consultant John Feng said: \"While electronic trading systems providing direct access to exchanges may well play a key part in equity derivatives trading at some point in the future, they are quite a long way from doing so yet.\" Among users of these trading systems, the proportion of listed equity index futures that is being routed directly to exchanges via electronic systems is pretty high, 49%. At institutions with equity derivatives trading volume of less than US$1 billion annually (on the lower end in volumes traded, among those institutions Greenwich Associates studied), that proportion is about 80%.

All three products -- Learning, Planning and Student -- are \"logical extensions\" of core administrative functions already served by Workday and are \"strategic areas that companies are investing in,\" said Leighanne Levensaler, the company's senior vice president of Product.\n\nWith input from its customers, Workday looks for opportunities to reimagine \"old, broken processes\" and outdated systems that workers often avoid using unless mandated to use them, Levensaler said.\n\nIn the case of Learning, for example, Levensaler said Workday seeks to replace clunky learning management systems with software that makes professional learning more like personal learning. Taking a cue from YouTube, this includes a heavy emphasis on video capabilities.\n\nOther features include peer-to-peer learning tools that make it possible for anyone to create and share content, because \"everyone is an expert on something,\" Levensaler said, and integration with Workday HCM that enables the software to offer content that is relevant to users.\n\n\"We know so much about people: their career interests, the skills they have, the skills they need, their location and information like are they a first-time manager,\" she said. \"We can use all of that information, all of that context to target content.\"\n\nNative reporting and analytics features can help organizations measure their learning activities for alignment with business priorities or other criteria. For example, after managers complete a development course, feedback can be captured from their reports in the following months to gauge the impact and value of the course.\n\nWorkday used feedback from controllers and other finance pros to design its Planning software, which includes a collaborative spreadsheet called Worksheets that allows teams to work with live data in spreadsheet-type format so that planning becomes more of a \"collaborative ongoing discussion,\" Levensaler said, noting that planning and continuous forecasting are top priorities for finance pros thanks to a dynamic business environment characterized by rapid change.\n\nAccording to a blog post by Joe Korngiebel, SVP of User Experience, Worksheets includes some 500 features, \"including those our customers know and love such as SUMIF, VLOOKUP, CONCATENATE, and hundreds of other go-tos\" as well a new functions such as one that will alert users when a particular area of a Worksheet changes or is completed, such as a manager finalizing his headcount number for the quarter.\n\nCustomers can upload existing xls, xlsx, csv, and txv files into Worksheets while keeping the same functions and formatting intact, Korngiebel wrote.\n\nWith Student, Workday hopes to capitalize on a market that Levensaler said is ripe for disruption. \"Most student systems today are older than the students using them so, by definition, they are not relevant.\" The company worked with 40 educational institutions over the past three years to produce a holistic system that includes student recruiting, admissions, curriculum management, student records, academic advising, financial aid and student financials.\n\n\"We wanted the system to be more informative and engaging for students but also a more efficient and intelligent way to manage student information,\" Levensaler said.\n\nSo, for example, both students and administrators can access a view of student financial obligations, including information on non-financial attributes such as course enrollment and residency status. And because Workday Student leverages the Workday platform, student financial payments are connected with Workday Financial Management, which ensures the accuracy of payment data and streamlines payment processes. Once a tuition payment has been submitted, the information is automatically updated in the institution's revenue and expense statement for administrative staff to track.\n\nIn a blog post, Caleb Cornelius, associate vice president of student business services for Broward College, one of Workday's design partners, said he was especially excited about the predictive analytics capabilities in Workday Student. \"With this kind of data, we can look at the student holistically, meaning not only classes and grades, but outside activities and appointments with tutors. This can help us plan ahead and anticipate things like a student falling into a bad financial situation or to intervene with a student who's struggling from missing multiple classes,\" he wrote."

Olson said. Her staff examined a sample of the questionable returns, finding suspicions on one in five-at the most. Under the Questionable Refund Program, run by the IRS Criminal Investigation office, a computer screens for potentially fraudulent returns, and the refunds are frozen, possibly for years. Taxpayers are not told anything until six months after trying to find out what happened to the refund.\"At a minimum, this procedure constitutes an extraordinary violation of fundamental taxpayer rights and fairness,\" Olson said.Most of the questions surrounded the earned income tax credit, and the average refund sought was $3,500.\nRichard Speier, acting chief of the Criminal Investigation division, told the Washington Post that the agency is facing a 322 percent increase in refund fraud over the past six years, and \"we are trying to . . . ensure that honest taxpayers and the tax system itself are not victimized.\" The frozen refunds represent a tiny fraction of about 130 million annual tax returns, he said.Olson told Congress that 66 percent of the taxpayers who demanded their refunds were found to be due all the money they sought, or even more, the New York Times reported.Trending\nThe newspaper quoted Leslie M. Book of Villanova University, who runs a tax clinic for the poor: \"Surely there are taxpayers who are ineligible claiming the credit,\" he said. \"But freezing refunds without giving taxpayers process is an extremely dangerous way to administer the earned income tax credit. These taxpayers often need more rather than less protection because they are not sophisticated, are afraid of government involvement.\" Although the refund freezes gained the most attention, it was No. 2 on Olson's list of worst taxpayer problems, which was contained in her annual report to Congress. Olson listed 21 issues in her report, with No. 1 being that the IRS plans to shift resources away from taxpayer service, encouraging taxpayers to use electronic services rather than face-to-face contact with employees. Olson said the IRS should first study what types of services taxpayers need and how any changes would affect compliance before making changes. No. 3 on her list was underreported income, and associated self-employment tax, from the \"cash economy.\" She said income from the cash economy may be the largest component of the tax gap, and may amount to more than $100 billion per year. The questionable refunds by the poor, by contrast, involves no more than $9 billion, but Olson said the IRS devoted far more resources to that problem than the one of businesses dealing only in cash.Another top concern is the training of private debt collection employees. Starting this summer, private collection firms will be seeking payment from delinquent taxpayers. \"The National Advocate is concerned about taxpayers interacting with private collection agents who have no understanding of important tax laws and will be trained by the contractors instead of the IRS,\" Olson said in her report.To read the executive summary, or the entire report, go to  Quote\nApr 8th 2015 IRS\nBramwell's Lunch Beat: IRS Criminal..."

I think it is going to happen,\" Burwell said. She noted that the U.S. Congress - with a Republican-led House of Representatives and a Democratic-led Senate - twice passed increases in the debt ceiling last year.\n\"We've gotten there twice before, and I think we will get there,\" she said.\nUnder a deal that ended the government shutdown in October, Congress suspended the debt ceiling until February 7. The government has cash-management tools it can use to temporarily stave off default, but Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned the government would exhaust its borrowing capacity by late February.\nRepublican lawmakers huddling at a bayside resort in Cambridge, Maryland, said they would insist on some concessions from President Barack Obama in return for raising the borrowing cap.\nRepublicans are scheduled to talk about their strategy on the debt limit on Friday, the final day of their three-day retreat. In exchange for raising the debt ceiling, they are considering asking for concessions ranging from expanded offshore energy production to small tweaks in Obama's healthcare law to approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline.\nIn an interview on CNN on Thursday, Ryan said Republicans see the debt limit debate as a time to engage in a discussion on ways to rein in long-term debt and deficits.\n\"We will not default on our bonds as a country,\" Ryan said. \"We know that's not a good idea, but we don't want to let the moment pass by without having a conversation about how can we make some improvements so we don't keep having these big debt ceiling problems day after day or year after year.\"\nBurwell said comments from House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders suggest they believe that passing a debt limit increase is something that \"just has to happen.\"\nEven so, it was not clear how far the Republicans might push their demands for concessions with a White House that has said it will not negotiate over the debt-limit increase. Failure to reach a deal until the 11th hour has spooked investors in the past.\nThe debt-limit fights have been costly. In 2011, the standoff cost the United States to lose its top-tier credit rating from Standard and Poor's.\nWhile it was unclear how close the Treasury came to a debt default last October, financial markets showed clear signs of stress, in some cases shunning what has traditionally been regarded as the safest, most liquid security on the planet: short-term U.S. Treasury debt.\n'MORE GROWTH, ENERGY, OPTIMISM'\nThe White House will unveil its annual budget proposal on March 4. Burwell declined to preview any details of the budget but offered an upbeat view of the nation's fiscal situation.\n\"We're at a place where there is more growth, energy and optimism,\" she said.\nThe Congressional Budget Office in November said the budget deficit for fiscal year 2013, which ended in September, was $680 billion. That was down from $1.089 trillion in 2012. The budget deficit peaked at $1.413 trillion in 2009, CBO said.\n\"With regard to the question of the long-term deficit issues, one of the main drivers of those costs is healthcare,\" Burwell said. \"What we've seen is for the first time in 50 years we've had the lowest growth in healthcare costs and those kinds of things are important to contributing to that long-term problem.\"\nBurwell would not comment on whether the president would renew his offer of reining in entitlement programs. Proposals in Obama's budget last year for curbing entitlement spending led to frictions with some congressional Democrats.\n\"We still think there are long-term deficit issues that you need to focus on,\" Burwell said. In the budget proposal, \"you're going to see an emphasis on the kinds of investments we need to make in the short term, that are important to both short-term growth and long-term growth\" such as spending on roads, bridges and ports, she said.\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Capitol Hill Blue\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Thomson Reuters All Rights Reserved\nShare  Capitol Hillbillies"

        "webpage": "European Union Reports Highest Unemployment Rates Ever For Eurozone By Bill Chappell\nJan 8, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email In Badalona, Spain, people waited outside an employment office last summer.\nAlbert Gea / Reuters /Landov\nOriginally published on January 8, 2013 3:24 pm In the European Union, unemployment rates in the region that uses the euro currency are at their highest ever, as a returned recession, falling income levels and persistent debt concerns trouble the region's economy, as its latest statistics show. After nearly five years of economic crises, the European Union is also seeing more divergence between its member nations, particularly in the north, where economies have resilience, as opposed to the south, where unemployment rates are an average of more than 7 points higher. From Brussels, Teri Schultz filed this report for our Newscast desk: \"More Europeans are out of work now in the eurozone  -  almost 11.8 percent  -  than in the entire two-decade history of the common currency.\" \"Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner Lazlo Andor says joblessness plus cutbacks in governments' social spending mean poverty is on the rise.\" \"'After a few years of persistent crisis, most national welfare systems have lost much of their ability to protect household incomes against the effects of the crisis,'\" he says. \"Andor says the economic divide is growing between EU nations north and south. Spain has the highest unemployment, at 26.6 percent of the working-age population. Austria has the lowest, at 4.5 percent. Andor says he hopes this year's a turning point.\" That's quite a downward turn from early 2008, when the eurozone's unemployment rate hovered around 7.2 percent. The most recent statistics reflect the situation in November of 2012. In its coverage of the EU report, the German newspaper Die Welt used a headline that stated bluntly (and roughly translated here), \"The social structure in Europe is breaking apart.\" Here's some analysis from BBC Economics Correspondent Andrew Walker: \"The biggest rises, in percentage terms, were in countries at the centre of the eurozone financial crisis - Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal. One striking exception to that pattern was the Republic of Ireland where unemployment fell. \"The general trend however remains upwards and it makes it even harder for the governments concerned to collect the taxes they need to stabilise their debts.\" Copyright 2015 NPR.

        "webpage": "... Don't rule out hedge funds in portfolio\nDo hedge funds belong in your portfolio?\nBy Elliot Raphaelson\nDo hedge funds belong in your portfolio?I have long preached that investors buy no-load, low-cost index funds. So why write about hedge funds? For one thing, \"hedge fund\" is one of those terms one comes across constantly in the media. If you've never been sure what one is, this column should help. And if you're somebody who has pondered adding a hedge fund to your portfolio - and there are a lot of people who have the appropriate net worth to do so - what follows might help you determine whether to do so.One common impression readers of the business pages have is that hedge funds charge higher fees than almost all mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Many articles have also made the point that hedge funds in recent years have done poorly, underperforming a large percentage of mutual funds and ETFs. Yet many wealthy investors continue to invest in hedge funds. Why? Curious, I presented a number of questions to Steve Patton, a manager who started his own hedge fund in 1999.Before starting his own company, Steve helped build several hedge funds, including Stark Investments, a Milwaukee-based fund, where he was head of trading in its formative days. Steve received his undergraduate degree from Wharton and his master's degree in quantitative finance from the University of Wisconsin, where he sometimes teaches courses on derivatives and hedge funds.My questions and his email responses, edited for brevity and clarity, follow.Q: Who should consider investing in hedge funds?A: First, a hedge fund investor must be \"accredited.\" This is a technical term established by the Security and Exchange Commission to ensure that only high-net-worth investors purchase hedge funds. Second, the investor should understand the diversifying benefits that hedge funds offer. Lastly, I believe the investor should be able to allocate $1 million to hedge funds and have this only be 25 percent of his or her assets. Unfortunately, if you have a $450,000 retirement account, you will unlikely be able to invest in hedge funds, because you won't meet the minimums of most funds, and it will be too costly to find the right ones.Q: Many critics of hedge funds state that because of the high (approximately 20 percent) fee paid to the manager, it is highly unlikely to be profitable. What is your response?A: To clarify, the fee you mention is the share of profits we receive. Aptly named a \"performance fee,\" it is only paid if the fund is profitable. The other fee is a \"management fee\" and is equal to or less than what mutual funds charge. So if a fund says it charges \"1 and 20,\" it means the annual management fee is 1 percent and the performance fee is 20 percent. We hedge fund managers claim that the performance fee aligns our interests with the investor's - that is, we want to make money, too. We argue that our superior risk-adjusted returns justify these fees.Q: What advantages do hedge fund managers have over mutual fund managers, whose fee is much smaller than those of hedge funds?A: We would argue that by charging a performance fee, we align our interests with yours. The mutual fund manager charges a percentage of assets under management, so the way he makes money is by gathering assets. We make money by performing. Also, we have access to much more sophisticated strategies - such as relative-value arbitrage, credit long/short and distressed debt investing - that may include shorting and leverage. These and other strategies provide great diversification benefits and generally cannot be implemented in the mutual-fund structure.Q: How has your fund performed in comparison to other alternatives?A: Hedge funds are not permitted to publicly state their performance, per limitations imposed by the SEC. That's why you won't hear anyone else talking about their performance. People believe hedge funds operate in some shadowy, mystical underworld because of this. It is the rules the government imposes on our industry that makes us so \"secretive.\"Q: How should an investor select a hedge fund?A: This can be tricky. There are so many different hedge fund strategies with various risk/return profiles that an individual investor should probably find an adviser or consultant to guide them. There are helpful databases that compile hedge fund returns and descriptions; however, they usually charge a fee. (Some examples are HedgeCo, BarclayHedge, PerTrac and Morningstar.) Investors should understand a fund's strategy and consider the stability of the historical returns, study its correlations with other assets, and check for major draw-downs (tail risk).Q: Can you summarize why an investor should consider hedge funds as part of his investment program?A: Hedge funds provide a way for investors to reshape the risk/return profile of their portfolio by deploying strategies that are uncorrelated with traditional stock and bond markets. Done right, the addition of hedge funds improves expected returns without changing the riskiness of the portfolio.You can contact Steve Patton at pattoninvestments.com.Contact Elliot Raphaelson, a certified court mediator in Florida with experience in estate planning, at ."

That's a big jump from last year, when only 25 percent of families in the state were living on the precipice, according to the Washington, D.C.-based organization.The policy group, which annually publishes its Assets & Opportunity Scorecard, noted that the state now ranks 29th in the country in terms of the percentage of residents who have so little savings that a personal disaster  -  such as a job loss, health crisis or other emergency  -  would be nearly impossible to withstand financially. The state ranked 26th last year.\"Although there are signs of improvement in Connecticut's economy, with unemployment edging downward in recent months, this year's Assets & Opportunity Scorecard paints a picture of a state  -  and a nation  -  that is struggling to achieve economic opportunity for all residents,\" Jennifer Brooks, director of state and local policy at the Corporation for Enterprise Development, said in a statement.Despite Connecticut's downward trend, the state still has a better record on the financial security of families than the rest of the nation. Nationally, nearly 44 percent of U.S. households are on the edge of financial disaster, the report said.\"In order to cope with the recession's continued impact, these families have had to prioritize today's expenses over tomorrow's goals,\" Andrea Levere, president of the policy group, said in a statement.She said the findings add a new layer to discussions in Congress about budget cuts that might reduce funding for the nation's social safety net and cut programs to help low- and moderate-income families get back on their feet.Lisa Shippee, director of housing services for the Norwich-based Thames Valley Council for Community Action, said cuts that social service agencies in the state already have sustained may have contributed to the downward spiral of people in Connecticut who are living on the edge. Reductions in energy assistance, for instance, have meant that many families are digging deep into their budgets to pay for heating oil, she said.\"The household budgets are just extremely tight,\" Shippee said. \"One bump in the road  -  a major car repair or a month without a job  -  anything can send you tumbling, and it's hard to stop.\"Shippee runs an eviction-prevention program, and she said it's not unusual to get 25 to 40 calls a week from people seeking help to catch up with their rent. But while in the past, families have needed only a few hundred dollars to avoid eviction, she said people these days are often seeking $3,000 to $6,000  -  far above the maximum help her agency can offer.\"Many people have liquidated their 401(k)s,\" Shippee said, referring to the popular retirement funds. \"It's been really tough for about five years now.\"Adding to the woes, she said, has been the lack of local employers willing to offer full-time work with benefits. This means breadwinners often have to string together two to three part-time jobs  -  without benefits  -  and then face a huge bill in April because not enough money was set aside from the individual jobs to cover their taxes.Another burden faced by Connecticut residents is credit card debt. The state's average debt of about $15,000 is the second highest in the nation, according to the report.In other measures, the state ranks 42nd on the affordability of homes, 43rd on the housing cost burden on owners and 44th on the rental burden. The high cost of housing statewide earned Connecticut an \"F\" on the scorecard issued Wednesday.Another area of concern to Connecticut residents is its ranking in the category of businesses and jobs. The state earned a \"D\" grade in this area, ranking 44th in business creation and 46th in private loans to small businesses.The state's ranking for overall financial assets and income, health care and education were all given a \"B\" grade.Among the suggestions made in the report to boost Connecticut's climate for building and preserving assets were to offer personal finance courses in high school, provide more assistance to first-time homebuyers and institute funding for a microenterprise association that would include a self-employment assistance \nNationwide findings 31 percent of households lack a savings account. 8 percent of households lack a mainstream financial account. 56 percent of consumers have subprime credit ratings (49 percent in Connecticut), meaning they must pay more to borrow money. The average college student is graduating with $26,600 in education-loan debt, up more than $550 from last year. 25 states saw increases in liquid-asset poverty during the year. 63 percent of minority households are asset poor, compared with 35 percent of white households.Source: Corporation for Enterprise Development"

        "webpage": "Argentina Crisis Puts Focus On Role Of Distressed-Debt Funds By Jim Zarroli\nAug 22, 2014 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email A woman in Buenos Aires walks with her dog past a mural that reads \"Vultures\" in Spanish. The mural is a reference to the dispute between the Argentine government and U.S. hedge funds.\nVictor R. Caivano\nOriginally published on August 22, 2014 5:09 pm The legal battle between Argentina and its creditors grinds on with no sign of a resolution anytime soon. The dispute pits the government against two New York hedge funds that specialize in buying distressed debt. These hedge funds bought Argentina's bonds at fire-sale prices and now stand to make huge profits off the country's financial troubles. But they've encountered a lot of resistance from the government. By one estimate there are as many as 250 investment funds that specialize in distressed debt. One of them is Maglan Capital, a hedge fund in midtown Manhattan. The fund's president, David Tawil, named the company Maglan after the biblical name for the bird known as the ibis. \"An ibis is well known for being the last animal to leave before a storm approaches and the first to return after a storm passes and essentially that is our investment strategy,\" Tawil says. Maglan purchases securities in troubled companies and governments  -  often for 15 or 20 cents on the dollar. Sometimes the fund can lose money. But if the company turns around Maglan can make a big profit. \"We will buy the debt of these companies with an eye towards having an ownership stake or an equity stake once the company goes through this bankruptcy,\" Tawil says. Distressed-debt investors say they play an invaluable role in rescuing bankrupt companies. Often they're the only investors willing to lend to a company that's struggling. But distressed debt is risky: You have to pick a company with a real chance of turning around. And when you get involved with bankrupt companies you can quickly become embroiled in messy legal battles with management, banks and other investors  -  all of whom have their own interests. \"There might be people that are higher in seniority than you,\" says Kent Collier, chief executive officer of Reorg Research. \"There might be people that want to shut down the company because they're going to get their money back faster. So very few elements of investing bring so much of the human sort of element into it.\" And things can get especially complicated when the debt you're buying was issued by a government, because politics enters into it. Argentina defaulted on its bonds in late 2001. Most of its bondholders long ago agreed to take a fraction of what the bonds were worth. But two hedge funds, NML Capital and Aurelius Capital Management, swept in to buy some of Argentina's distressed debt. And though they paid a fraction of what the debt is worth, they are demanding to be paid the bonds' full value. Edward Altman of NYU's Stern School of Business says there's nothing illegal about the hedge funds' demands. \"They have the right to not accept what they think was a flawed plan and the fact that they were holdouts doesn't make them vultures,\" he says. But Argentina is worried that if it pays the hedge funds full value, all its others creditors can line up to demand the same thing, something the country cannot afford. And so it has refused to pay. Meanwhile, a federal judge has ruled that until Argentina pays the hedge funds $1.5 billion it can't pay any of its other creditors  -  so Argentina is now in default on other bond payments that have come due. \"There is sort of this bizarre thing where on the one hand you have a creditor that wants more than anyone else, and on the other hand you have a debtor that is just flat out saying, 'I have a contract but I won't pay,' \" says Anna Gelpern, a professor at Georgetown Law School. Maglan Capital's David Tawil says he believes the hedge funds are legally within their right to demand full payment. But on a moral basis he understands how people might disagree. Argentina, after all, is a sovereign government. \"And it think that's where things start to get muddy, is that you're going ahead and taking advantage of a sovereign,\" he says. \"A sovereign is not a corporation; a sovereign is simply there to serve its citizens. So the argument is you're hurting the citizenry of Argentina by doing this. Why would you do this?\" The dispute between the government of Argentina and the hedge funds could carry on for some time. But whoever wins, a lot of people in Argentina will end up paying a price.Copyright 2014 NPR. To see more, visit . View the discussion thread. \u00a9 2015 Jefferson Public Radio"

This includes information that is being stored, requested, or shared. These regulations can apply to individuals, businesses, or governments.\nPrivacy is commonly regarded as a fundamental right. In many countries, the issue is taken so seriously that privacy regulations for certain entities are developed at the federal level. For example, in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) dictates how privacy must be handled by financial institutions. These regulations not only outline which entities can be defined as financial institutions, but they also state how those that qualify must act in certain circumstances.\nPrivacy regulations can also be set at lower levels of government. In some cases, regulations are not a matter of law. Instead, institutions may bind themselves to certain procedures and standards on their own accord.\nInformation, in many cases, is sensitive. When a person goes to the doctor, a record is generally kept for her welfare and for the protection of those who treated her. When a person conducts a financial transaction, a record is often kept to assure proper accounting. Such records can benefit both the client and the service provider. If, however, this information is obtained by a third party, a person's privacy may be violated and problems could ensue. Ad\nPrivacy regulations dictate numerous relationships between numerous entities. In some cases, these rules determine procedures for fulfilling requests when one party seeks information regarding a third party. Some third parties do not have rights to obtain information without the consent of the person the information concerns. This can even be true if the third party is a spouse or parent.\nThere may also be a limit as to which information one can disclose. For example, if a person is in a car accident, an auto insurance company may request medical records regarding ailments pertaining to that event. That does not, however, give the auto insurance company rights to a person's entire medical record. Giving someone information he is not entitled to is not the only way to violate someone's privacy. Care must also be taken to store regulated information in a manner that shows an effort to protect the privacy of the people it pertains to. A bank, for example, could be found guilty of violating privacy regulations if financial records are stored in an open trailer behind the facility.\nShowing proper effort to protect sensitive information also takes into account how one entity communicates with someone it is associated with.

        "webpage": "The Turning Point for Venture Capital?\n\nFollowing a rapid reversal of fortunes at the turn of the millennium, the venture capital industry has experienced largely lacklustre returns which have led to tough fundraising conditions for all but a select group of top-tier managers. However, more recently there have been some encouraging signs across the industry, with market conditions becoming more favourable, returns improving and fundraising picking up as investors take note. Is this the turning point for venture capital? Jessica Duong has examined the drivers of this success, and the impact of this on LP attitudes to the asset class.\n\nAccording to Preqin report, \"the pattern for venture capital returns shows clear underperformance relative to other strategies over 10 years, with an improving picture more recently past.\" The internet, software, healthcare, telecoms and media industries are the sectors which have seen the highest level of investment in 2014 YTD. As expected, North America comprises the biggest proportion of global venture deal value by a significant margin; however, other markets such as Israel and India are also showing positive signs of growth.\n\nTherefore, as venture capital performance improves and translates into higher returns for LPs, investor confidence in the venture capital industry has started to return. October 2014 saw the highest number of funds in market in the period 2007 - 2014 YTD, in addition to the fact that the proportion of venture capital funds failing to meet their targets is currently at a record low of 30%.\n\nA recovery is well underway for the venture capital industry and investors are exhibiting signs of increased confidence, as reflected in the rising amounts of capital secured by venture capital funds, and deal and exit activity is growing. However, conditions are still tough, and venture capital fund managers seeking capital commitments need to continue to demonstrate to prospective investors that they have a strong strategy and deal pipeline, and a good alignment of interests.\n\nOverall, the global venture capital landscape is currently seeing favourable conditions that are pointing to a healthy fundraising market and a strong deals environment. However, fund managers still face challenges in securing capital as investors are wary of the asset class, given the largely disappointing returns in the past 10 years, and will need to see more consistent performance over time. The recent uptick in venture capital performance confirms the market is at a real turning point. Should these trends continue, more investors will take notice and we could see a rejuvenated market.\n\nCheck Also\n\nPrize4Life is a nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the discovery of treatments and cures for ALS.

        "webpage": "Will Ukraine Do What It Takes To Unlock International Aid? By Michele Kelemen\nFeb 24, 2014 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Ukrainians line up to get their money from a bank machine in the western city of Lviv last week. Clashes in Independence Square in Kiev and the resulting political turmoil caused a financial panic.\nOriginally published on February 24, 2014 6:55 pm The United States, hoping to avert economic chaos in Ukraine, is prepared to send financial support to supplement aid from the International Monetary Fund, the White House said on Monday. \"The United States, working with partners around the world, stands ready to provide support for Ukraine as it takes the reforms it needs to, to get back to economic stability,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney told a news briefing. After three months of street protests and the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, the U.S. and others are now urging Ukraine's interim leaders to start talking to the IMF about just what reforms are needed to unlock international aid. Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski took the lead in negotiating an end to the political standoff in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, last week. He says that the only way for Ukraine to succeed now is to get its economy in shape. To do that, he says, the country needs the IMF. \"We need to help Ukraine get back within the IMF program so that she may receive huge macroeconomic assistance,\" he says. The U.S. Treasury has sent some of its officials to Kiev this week, to work along with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burn to sort out a path to stability with the help of international funding. But it may be a tough mission because the IMF doesn't have a good history in Ukraine, says Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"The IMF has  -  over the past 20 years  -  sent its senior people to Kiev many times, and they've sort of stopped going because they've been exasperated by what they've heard there,\" he says. What they heard about was corruption and a lack of political will to reform the economy. Anders Aslund, a longtime Ukraine analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, believes this time could be different because the situation is so critical. He estimates that Ukraine needs an infusion of $15 billion  -  and soon. \"The IMF could put up $10 [billion to] $12 billion and the European Union could co-finance with $3 [billion to] $5 billion and this could be done in a month's time,\" he says. Aslund says Ukraine needs to allow its currency to fluctuate, raise gas prices and cut spending. But there is one big problem. \"As yet, we don't know where Russia will come in,\" he said. \"It's extremely important that the U.S. and the European Union act through direct contacts with Moscow.\" Russia wants Ukraine to join a customs union with other former Soviet states rather than look to the EU for closer economic ties. But the United States and EU hope Russia will allow Ukraine to have a relationship with many economic partners, arguing that it's in Russia's economic interests to act cooperatively, says Matthew Rojansky, director of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center. \"Stability and recovery of the Ukrainian economy benefits Russia because of the degree of investment in Ukraine,\" Rojansky says. \"If Ukraine is able to produce and send products to Russia, and if Ukrainians are able to buy Russian products, that's good for the Ukrainian economy, and Russia needs that right now.\" But unlike Russia, which has clear economic interests at stake, leaders in the EU and the U.S. may have a tougher argument persuading lawmakers to spend money on helping restore the economy in Ukraine, he says. \"Members of Congress will get very excited and issue statements about Ukraine, but there's a long distance between that and actually voting to open the floodgates of American assistance at a time when resources are tight all around,\" Rojansky says. But the U.S. and its allies can't afford to put off dealing with Ukraine for too long, warns Jean-Claude Trichet, the former head of the European Central Bank. He told a group of top economists Monday that political leaders in the West need to understand that Ukraine's political meltdown could turn into an \"extraordinarily dangerous\" threat to global stability and economic recovery \"We should not take lightly the Ukrainian problem,\" Trichet said at the National Association for Business Economics convention in Arlington, Va. Ukraine's political chaos might rekindle hostility between Russia and the West, Trichet said. And such hostility could lead to military conflicts and instability in a region still struggling with recession and huge government debt problems. Ukraine must emerge from this crisis with \"a good relationship with all of its neighbors,\" which include Russia and EU members such as Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, he said.Copyright 2014 NPR.

For more than three and a half years Argentina had suffered through one of the deepest recessions of the 20th century. ...\n\"Then Argentina defaulted on its foreign debt and cut loose from the dollar ... the economy shrank for just one more quarter after the devaluation and default; it then grew 63 percent over the next six years.\n\"The main reason for Argentina's rapid recovery was that it was finally freed from adhering to fiscal and monetary policies that stifled growth. The same would be true for Greece if it were to drop the euro.\"\nI agree with a lot of what he says, but am still not ready to counsel that step, for a couple of reasons. First, while I agree that Argentina is the right parallel, it's an imperfect parallel: although Argentina had a supposedly irreversible peg to the dollar, it still had peso notes in circulation, so the mechanics of exit from the peg were much easier than exiting the euro would be. And the mechanics matter a lot; they could make all the difference between a brief period of shock and an extended financial breakdown.\nSecond, Greece, as a relatively poor country with a history of shaky governance, has a lot to gain from being a citizen in good standing of the European project  -  concrete things like aid from cohesion funds, hard-to-quantify but probably important things like the stabilizing effect, economically and politically, of being part of a grand democratic alliance.\nA euro exit could do much more damage to Greece in the long run than Argentina faced from its devaluation.\nThat said, Mr. Weisbrot is right in saying that Europe's program for Greece is not working; it's not even close to working. At the very least there must be a debt restructuring that actually reduces the debt burden rather than simply stretching it out. And the longer this situation remains unresolved, the less hope I have that Greece will be able to stay with the euro, even if it wants to.\nGreek Out\nAn Argentine commenter notes that Argentina, in addition to letting the peso drop, both defaulted on its debt and imposed temporary restrictions on bank withdrawals. Indeed. Something similar would have to happen for a Greek exit from the euro to take place.\nBut bear in mind that the first piece is already a foregone conclusion: everyone knows that Greece won't repay its debt in full. The problem is that even if the country defaults on its debt, it still faces the problem of wages and prices way out of line with the core euro countries. So devaluation is what you do when default isn't enough.\nAs for the second point, the main argument against the possibility of a euro breakup has been precisely that any hint of exit would unleash the mother of all bank runs. So how could exit take place? I argued some time ago that it would have to happen in the context of a banking crisis that forces a temporary closure of the banks  -  something along the lines of the Argentine corralito.\nThis is why I find it hard to imagine any European government making a solemn, deliberate decision to leave the euro. But I can easily see how events could lead to a situation in which euro exit becomes the least bad option.\nPaul Krugman joined The New York Times in 1999 as a columnist on the Op-Ed page and continues as a professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University.

        "webpage": "Progress in gender equality leads to economic growth, says European Commission report\nEuropean Commission - Press release\nBrussels, 16 April 2012 - Improving equality between women and men is essential to the EU's response to the current economic crisis, according to the European Commission's latest annual report on gender equality. The report looks at progress over the past year in tackling the remaining gaps between women and men in employment, the economy and society in general. While some progress has been made in increasing the number of women in top jobs in business and in narrowing the gender pay gap, major challenges remain. EU countries need to get more women into the labour market if they are to meet the EU's overall objective of 75% employment rate for all adults by 2020. One of the way's of improving Europe's competitiveness is to obtain better balance between women and men in economic decision-making positions. Studies have shown that gender diversity pays off and companies with higher percentages of women on corporate boards perform better than those with all-male boards. \"The economic case for getting more women into the workforce and more women into top jobs in the EU is overwhelming,\" said Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the European Commission in charge of Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship. \"We can only reach our economic and employment goals by making full use of all our human resources - both in the labour market as a whole and at the top. This is an essential part of our economic recovery plans.\" Today's report on progress made during 2011 on equality between women and men is part of the Commission's broader report on the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in the past year (IP/12/370). It highlights the main developments at both national and European level across the five key areas in the EU's overall gender equality strategy for 2010-2015, namely: the economy, equal pay, decision-making, gender-based violence and gender equality beyond the EU. In the labour market, the employment rate for women is 62.1%, compared to 75.1% for men, meaning the EU can only reach the overall Europe 2020 target rate of 75% employment with a strong commitment to gender equality. Under the Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission has highlighted the need to promote a better work-life balance, in particular through adequate childcare, more access to flexible working arrangements, and by making sure tax and benefit systems do not penalise second earners (IP/11/685). These can all help to make sure more women enter and remain in the labour market. The gender pay gap has narrowed slightly across the EU. On average, women earn 16.4% less than men for every hour worked. The gender pay gap is caused by multiple factors such as labour market segregation and differences in educational choices. The second European Equal Pay Day highlighted this issue and the potential solutions (IP/12/211). Slow progress in narrowing the gender gap in company boardrooms led the Commission to launch a public consultation on possible measures at EU level to address the problem, which risks holding back innovation and growth in Europe (IP/12/213).\nFinally, the Commission took an important step towards the goal of ending gender-based violence by proposing a package of measures to strengthen the rights of crime victims (IP/11/585). This included a series of measures specifically aimed at helping women who fall victim to domestic violence.\nPromoting more equality in decision-making is one of the goals set out in the European Women's Charter (see IP/10/237), which was initiated by President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso and Vice-President Reding in March 2010. The Commission pursued these commitments by adopting a Gender Equality Strategy in September 2010 for the next five years (see IP/10/1149 and MEMO/10/430). The Strategy sets out a series of actions across four further areas in addition to equality in decision-making: equal economic independence; equal pay for work of equal value; dignity, integrity and ending gender-based violence; and gender equality in external policies.\nA growing body of evidence points to significant economic benefits stemming from a better gender balance in economic decision-making. Having more women in top jobs can contribute to a more productive and innovative working environment and improved company performance overall. This bolsters competitiveness. Women account for 60% of new university graduates but few make it to the top of companies. Opening the door to senior positions acts as an incentive for women to enter and stay in the workforce, helping to raise female employment rates and making better use of women's potential as human resources.

        "webpage": "U.S. bank ratings improved in 2013 SNL Report: Agencies' outlook somewhat brighter\nComments: comments By Andy Pierce, SNL Financial staff writer\nThe U.S. banking system was on solid footing for most of 2013, in the eyes of the big three rating agencies.\nAs was the case in 2012, Moody's issued the majority of the downgrades in the space, according to SNL data. The analysis excluded banking subsidiaries of firms not classified by SNL as a bank or thrift.\nDespite the downgrades, Moody's changed its U.S. banking system outlook to \"stable\" in May 2013, after the outlook had remained negative since 2008. The change in outlook \"represents continued improvement in the operating environment and reduced downside risks to the banks from a faltering economy,\" according to the agency.\nAt the end of May, Fitch affirmed its stable outlook for the banking industry, mentioning better liquidity and capital, as well as improving asset quality and stricter regulation in the space. Fitch issued upgrades on 17 banks during the year, compared to only 12 bank downgrades, according to SNL data.\nPerhaps the most notable series of downgrades was issued by Moody's in mid-November after the agency reviewed eight large banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. had their long-term holding company ratings downgraded as a result of the review, while Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., and State Street Corp. had their long-term ratings affirmed. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley were also included in the review but both firms are classified by SNL as a broker-dealer.\nThe actions partially reflect a change in Moody's assumptions about implied government support due to \"strengthened U.S. bank resolution tools, prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act,\" the agency noted.\n\"We believe that U.S. bank regulators have made substantive progress in establishing a credible framework to resolve a large, failing bank,\" said Robert Young, managing director at Moody's.\nFurther, Moody's mentioned the ratings actions also reflect changing credit profiles for certain banks, and also cited long-term profitability challenges for the custodian banks State Street Bank and Trust Co. and Bank of New York Mellon.\nFirst Horizon National Corp. and its unit First Tennessee Bank NA were the only banks to have their long-term rating downgraded by both Moody's and S&P in 2013. First Horizon National Corp.'s Moody's rating now sits just above investment grade, while the recent S&P downgrade knocks the bank's long-term rating just one notch below the investment-grade threshold.\nThe downgrades came on the heels of a $200 million increase in mortgage repurchase reserves by the bank. Shortly after the provision announcement, Fitch took the opportunity to affirm its ratings of the bank, but S&P credit analyst Richard Zell cited additional uncertainties regarding mortgage repurchase risks and litigation when discussing the downgrade. Moody's echoed that sentiment, saying that the bank's profitability continues to be weighed down by sizable mortgage repurchase provisions.\nTurning to the upgrades during the year, Synovus Financial Corp. and its unit Synovus Bank were the only banks to be upgraded by all three major rating agencies, with the banks even receiving two upgrades from Moody's in 2013. The most recent upgrades all came on the heels of Synovus' announcement that it would be redeeming the $967.9 million in TARP preferred capital it had borrowed from the U.S. Treasury. In addition, Synovus completed a common and preferred offering in which the bank raised combined gross proceeds of $315 million to help fund the redemption.\nFifth Third Bancorp was a large regional bank to benefit from upgrades from both Fitch and S&P. Fitch upgraded the bank Oct. 8, 2013, after reviewing 14 large regional banks in total. The agency cited Fifth Third's strong earnings profile. S&P, which upgraded its rating on the bank in late September 2013, cited Fifth Third's improving asset quality, declining exposure to troubled real estate markets, and credit risk management enhancements.\nTopics: Management, Financial Trends, CSuite, Bank Performance, Performance, Tweet SNL Financial SNL Financial is the premier provider of breaking news, financial data, and expert analysis on business sectors critical to the global economy: Banking, Insurance, Financial Services, Real Estate, Energy, Media & Communications and Metals & Mining.

        "webpage": "Elizabeth Warren: Hey, why isn't the minimum wage $22/hour?\nposted at 1:21 pm on March 18, 2013 by Erika Johnsen\nOh, minimum wage  -  the simple- and friendly-sounding yet actually regressive and economy-damaging populist throwback that just refuses to die. President Obama once again resurrected the timelessly terrible idea in his State of the Union speech in February, and it's been percolating among the Democrats as a potential 2014-oriented rallying cry for how those obstructionist Republicans must really, really hate poor people because there's no other possible explanation for their opposition (except that, you know, minimum wage hikes are actually counterproductive to an inclusive and prospering economy, but let's just rid ourselves of any lingering school-girl notions that facts are what matter here, shall we?).\nLast week in a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Sen. Elizabeth Warren wondered, \"If we started in 1960, and we said that, as productivity goes up  -  that is, as workers are producing more  -  then the minimum wage is going to go up the same. And, if that were the case, the minimum wage today would be about $22 an hour. So, my question, Mr. Dube, is what happened to the other $14.75?\" National Review picked up on it:\nOof. Last month, HuffPo pointed out a 2012 'study' that concluded pretty much the same thing:\nPresident Obama's call to increase the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour was one of the more significant proposals he laid out in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. But $9 an hour is still a far cry from what workers really deserve, a 2012 study finds.\nThe minimum wage should have reached $21.72 an hour in 2012 if it kept up with increases in worker productivity, according to a March study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research. While advancements in technology have increased the amount of goods and services that can be produced in a set amount of time, wages have remained relatively flat, the study points out. ...\nBetween the end of World War II and the late 1960s, productivity and wages grew steadily. Since the minimum wage peaked in 1968, increases in productivity have outpaced the minimum wage growth.\nI'm calling shenanigans. That is one wildly flawed premise, because the value of productivity is not a constant. As HuffPo's writeup cedes, \"advancements in technology have increased the amount of goods and services that can be produced in a set amount of time,\" not to mention with fewer resources and at a lower cost  -  should in the increase in crop yield from a farmer using a donkey and plow versus a farmer using a tractor be directly proportional to an increase in those crops' market worth because of some sort of imagined moral law about productivity and wages? No, because the market value of those crops has diminished as the ease of production has increased, and if that was the way the world worked, we'd all be paying a heck of a lot more for food right now.\nAgain, raising the minimum wage to some arbitrarily-determined level of ostensible just deserts is just another way of throwing market signals under the bus in exchange for more top-down control, which might benefit a few in the short run, but bogs down the entire economy in the long run. As Christina Romer, former head of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, put it:\nRaising the minimum wage, as President Obama proposed in his State of the Union address, tends to be more popular with the general public than with economists. ...\nFirst, what's the argument for having a minimum wage at all? Many of my students assume that government protection is the only thing ensuring decent wages for most American workers. But basic economics shows that competition between employers for workers can be very effective at preventing businesses from misbehaving. If every other store in town is paying workers $9 an hour, one offering $8 will find it hard to hire anyone  -  perhaps not when unemployment is high, but certainly in normal times. Robust competition is a powerful force helping to ensure that workers are paid what they contribute to their employers' bottom lines."

        "webpage": "The times when stealthy, persistent and advanced malware was associated only with cyberespionage are gone. Criminals are now using similar threats and techniques to steal millions of dollars from financial institutions.\n\nLast year researchers from security vendor Kaspersky Lab were called in to investigate unusual thefts from 29 banks and other organizations located in Russia, leading to the discovery of three new sophisticated attack campaigns. Their findings were presented Monday during the company's annual Security Analyst Summit.\n\nOne group of attackers is using a modular malware program known as Metel or Corkow to infect computer systems belonging to banks and to reverse ATM transactions. During a single night, the gang stole millions of rubles from a Russian bank using this hard-to-detect transaction rollback trick.\n\nThe Metel attackers start off by sending spear phishing emails with malicious links to the employees of banks and other financial institutions. Once they compromise computers in those organizations, they move laterally inside the networks to identify and gain access to the systems that control transactions.\n\nOnce this is achieved, they automate the rollback of ATM transactions for particular debit cards issued by the institution. During the night, the attackers drive around various cities and withdraw money from the ATMs of other banks. However, in the card issuing bank's systems the transactions are automatically reversed so the account balances never change.\n\nThe Kaspersky researchers said that they discovered the Metel malware on computers belonging to 30 financial institutions from Russia. However, they believe that the group's activities are far more widespread and could affect financial organizations from around the world.\n\nA second group that also targets banks and financial institutions uses a malware program dubbed GCMAN, which is distributed using emails with malicious executable RAR archives and which masquerade as Microsoft Word documents.\n\nSimilarly to some cyberespionage groups, the GCMAN attackers use legitimate system administration and penetration testing tools like Putty, VNC and Meterpreter for lateral movement inside networks. The group identifies servers that handle financial transactions and creates cron jobs (scheduled tasks) to automate transfers to multiple e-currency services, typically during weekends. In one case, the Kaspersky researchers found scripts that initiated transactions at a rate of $200 per minute.\n\nThe GCMAN group also stands out because of its patience. In one incident, it waited a year and a half from the initial point of compromise until it started siphoning money. During that time its members probed 70 internal hosts, compromised 56 accounts and used 139 different IP addresses to do it, mainly associated with Tor exit nodes and compromised home routers.\n\nAs with Metel, the Kaspersky researchers only identified GCMAN victims in Russia, specifically three financial institutions. However, it's likely that the group's reach extends beyond the country.\n\nThe third group is not new, but is one that previously went silent for about five months after being exposed in February 2015. Until that time, the cybercime gang had used a custom malware program called Carbanak to steal millions of dollars from hundreds of financial institutions in at least 30 countries.\n\nThe group has returned with a new version of the malware -- Carbanak 2.0 -- and has started targeting budgeting and accounting departments in non-financial organizations as well.\n\n\"In one remarkable case, the Carbanak 2.0 gang used its access to a financial institution that stores information about shareholders to change the ownership details of a large company,\" the Kaspersky researchers said in a blog post. \"The information was modified to name a money mule as a shareholder of the company, displaying their IDs. It's unclear how they wanted to make use of this information in future.\"\n\nKaspersky Lab has released indicators of compromise for the tools used by all three groups so that organizations around the world can scan their own networks for potential compromise.\n\nJoin the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind."

        "webpage": "Scotland: New country, new currency? by Mark Thompson @MarkThompsonCNN February 13, 2014: 12:59 PM ET Three Scottish banks are authorized to issue pound notes under rules dating back to 1845. But the country may need a new currency if it chooses to break away from the U.K. later this year. It's a union that's lasted 307 years, but England and Scotland could be heading for the divorce courts later this year. Arguments over money tend to generate the most heat in any separation, and the possibility of a Scottish vote for independence in September is already sparking a furious row between London and Edinburgh. If Scotland votes to go it alone, there will be plenty of big questions about the U.K. economy. How will national debt be divided? Who gets what in terms of wealth from North Sea oil and gas? What will happen to Scotland's outsized banking sector? But the Scottish government's central economic proposal -- to keep the pound as part of a new sterling zone -- seems dead in the water. Related: Scotland's bid for independence In a speech in Edinburgh on Thursday, U.K. Chancellor George Osborne said the nationalists' plan was a non-starter. \"People need to know -- that is not going to happen,\" he said. \"If Scotland walks away from the U.K., it walks away from the pound.\" Keeping a sterling zone stable would require Scotland to cede precisely the kind of political, economic and financial autonomy its pro-independence leaders say they want to reclaim from London, he warned. Without that, Scotland would be exposed to the risks highlighted by the eurozone crisis, and the rest of the U.K. would potentially be on the hook to bail out Scotland and its banking sector, which is 12 times as big as GDP. \"We got Britain out of the eurozone bailouts. Now we'd be getting into an arrangement that was just the same,\" Osborne said. Related: Europe's economy: What could go wrong? So what are the alternatives, assuming Scotland votes for independence and refuses to accept London's terms for keeping the pound? There are a few, but none are particularly attractive. For years, the nationalists' plan was to take Scotland into the European Union as an independent state, and then adopt the euro. They still want EU membership but the eurozone crisis killed talk of joining the single currency. Making the best beef in the world Scotland could opt to continue using the pound, in the way countries such as Panama, Ecuador and El Salvador have adopted the U.S. dollar. That could shore up confidence in the economy and ensure continued close integration with the U.K. Related: The world's most expensive whisky But the newly-born state would have no control over monetary policy or its exchange rate, and would have no claim on the financial backstop provided by the Bank of England. The last option would be to establish a new currency, managed by a new central bank. That would give Scotland complete independence but would likely mean higher interest rates, and rigid control of spending to ensure investors retain their confidence. Opinion polls still show a clear lead for those against independence, although the gap has narrowed in recent surveys.

        "webpage": "Fed Focus comments Fed: Low rates until unemployment below 6.5% By Annalyn Kurtz @AnnalynKurtz January 4, 2013: 2:04 PM ET Bernanke and fiscal cliff in 90 seconds NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Some call it QE Infinity. The Federal Reserve announced plans Wednesday to expand its controversial and open-ended stimulus program known as quantitative easing, and keep short-term interest rates near zero. And the central bank dropped more hints as to when those easing programs might end, linking both to the strength of the job market. One economist called it an \"historic move,\" signaling the Fed is putting more weight on the unemployment rate than ever before. \"This is as aggressive as Fed easing has ever been,\" said Sherry Cooper, chief economist for BMO Financial Group. The Fed will buy $45 billion in Treasuries, in addition to its existing policy of buying $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month. Those new Treasury purchases go above and beyond Operation Twist, a policy set to end this month that swapped short-term Treasuries the Fed already owned for longer term bonds. The hope is the additional purchases will continue to push long-term interest rates even lower. Mortgage rates have already fallen to record lows, in step with the Fed's stimulus program, and a housing recovery seems to be building steam. The end date for all this easing? Bond buying will continue until the job market improves \"substantially,\" and rates will remain at historic lows until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5%, or inflation exceeds 2.5% a year. Wednesday was the first time the Fed has issued an exact target for the unemployment rate, and it marked the end of the Fed's calendar guidance, which previously stated it planned to keep interest rates low until at least 2015. The unemployment rate recently fell to 7.7% in November, but the decline was largely because 350,000 people stopped looking for work that month. \"Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated,\" the Federal Reserve said in a statement Wednesday. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has also repeatedly expressed concerns about what might happen to the economy if Congress and the White House are unable to agree on a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of tax hikes and automatic spending cuts by the end of the year. For these reasons, the Fed reiterated Wednesday that it expects to keep its key interest rate, the federal funds rate, near zero until there is more significant improvement in the job market. The federal funds rate is the rate banks pay to lend money to each other overnight, and it influences other key interest rates on mortgages, credit cards and business loans. Related: Federal Reserve official aims for 6.5% unemployment The Fed has kept this rate near zero for four years, but that alone has not stimulated the economy enough to lead to a full jobs recovery. To add additional stimulus, the Fed has also been purchasing various types of bonds. The Fed's policy is not without risks though. Some economists fear the Fed will find it difficult to shed these assets should the economy eventually heat up. Because these purchases also add to the money supply, critics (including some Fed officials) also worry this policy could eventually fuel inflation and weaken the value of the U.S. dollar. Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, one of the Fed's voting members, opposed buying more bonds Wednesday, as he has all year. He has said in the past that he fears the purchases will have little impact on the economy, other than to fuel inflation. Greenspan: Government cuts key to debt fix For now, rapid inflation seems a long way off though. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation, calculated by the Commerce Department, has not exceeded 2% a year (the Fed's long-run target) for four consecutive years. And with wages barely rising, inflation is unlikely to accelerate any time soon. The Fed also issued new economic forecasts Wednesday. The central bank lowered its growth projections for 2013 slightly but also indicated that the unemployment rate may fall further than it had thought just a few months ago.

        "webpage": "Daniel Altman: Don't Fear the Debt, Fear Austerity\nUnited States ran up big debts during the global financial crisis and the recession in the aftermath trying to stimulate the economy and make sure that we didn't deep dive into an even deeper recession than where we already were. That makes sense because if you're in the middle of a downturn it's not a good time to put on the brakes with fiscal austerity, raising taxes to raise more money, and cutting spending to tighten the government's belt.\nIt especially doesn't make sense if you can borrow at low interest rates. And during the recent crisis, the United States could borrow at some of the lowest interest rates in its history, and that's why our debt problem is not as urgent as a lot of people may say. Right now the debt service that we pay, that's the interest payments that we pay all the time, are at a very low rate. In fact, they were much higher during the Reagan and first Bush Administrations.\nThis may not last forever because interest rates can rise, just as they can fall. And if interest rates do rise, which typically happens when the economy recovers and there's more demand for credit, then we will have to start paying a little bit more and we'll have to start thinking more about how we're going to close that big debt gap.\nWe have several years before that happens, though, so we can phase in a nice gradual solution without making any sharp cuts to spending and without making any sharp increases in tax rates. But over the long term, there's no doubt - we need to cut spending a little bit and we need to have higher tax rates because right now we have some of the lowest effective tax rates since the 1940s and at a time when people expect more than ever from their government. We'll have to deal with Social Security and Medicare, too, but we typically do that by extending the retirement age a little bit, cutting benefits a little bit, and maybe we'll even remove benefits from some higher earners.\nAll of these things together will help us to close our debt gap, but we don't have to do it in a sharp shocking way today. We have a few years of runway to do it.\nIt's definitely not a good idea just to kick the can down the road and let the next government deal with it. It's tempting to do that because people in this government are more concerned about re-election than what might happen ten or 20 years from now, but we can use the time that we have to phase in these changes so that there aren't abrupt dislocations in our economy. A responsible Congress would act now setting a plan that would phase in these changes over the next five to ten years.\nMore ideas from Daniel Altman\nDaniel Altman: Don't Fear the Debt\nWhy Brazil Needs to Win the World Cup\n(Econ201) The Euro Zone\nBig Think's chief economist Daniel Altman favors a \"gradual solution\" to fixing the U.S. debt.

        "webpage": "When a purchase involves both cash and stock, buyer and seller beware\nGuest Voices By SEAN SAARI\nLinkedIn Google+ Sean Saari is a senior manager in Skoda Minotti's Valuation and Litigation Advisory Services group. He focuses his practice in the areas of valuation, litigation advisory services, complex damages analysis and modeling, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic planning.\nWe are all familiar with the phrase \"cash is king.\" Why is it, though, that cash is crowned king and not real estate, bonds or LeBron James?It all boils down to the fact that everyone can agree to the value of a dollar bill without dispute  -  $1 is worth $1. Someone cannot reasonably argue that a dollar bill is really worth $1.10 or 90 cents.As a result, investors typically prefer to receive cash when selling an ownership interest in a business. It is not uncommon, however, for an acquirer to pay part of the purchase price of an acquisition with its own stock.In the case of a privately held acquirer, the value of its stock is somewhat subjective and there can be reasonable arguments for what one person perceives as being valued at $1 per share being worth 70 cents or $1.40. You get the idea. As a result, it is imperative that both the acquirer and the target in a transaction have support for, and a level of comfort with, the value assigned to the acquirer's shares if they are issued as part of the deal.There is risk on both sides of a transaction when a privately held company is issuing shares as a component of deal consideration. The buyer has an incentive to overvalue its stock and issue fewer shares to the seller, which results in the seller not receiving sufficient compensation for its company. The seller, on the other hand, has an incentive to undervalue the acquirer's stock in an effort to receive more shares and greater ownership percentage, which results in the buyer overpaying. As you can see, there are competing interests that can heighten the incentives for, and the likelihood of, overpayment or underpayment.Another factor that must be considered is that shares in a privately held company are typically subject to a meaningful lack of marketability discount, which may be greater than 30% of the acquiring company's undiscounted value. This discount takes into account the fact that a minority owner in a privately held company cannot readily turn his or her ownership interest into cash (unlike an investment in a publicly traded company). If this discount is not considered when assigning value to the acquirer's shares, it can result in the seller receiving less value than he or she would have had all of the proceeds been paid in cash.The impact of discounts for lack of marketability can extend to shares of publicly traded companies issued in connection with acquisitions as well. We have seen instances in which the sellers in a transaction received restricted stock of the publicly traded acquirer. The restrictions did not permit the sale of the shares for periods ranging from a few months to a few years, which makes the shares less valuable than they would be if they were freely tradable from day one. Imagine receiving shares of a publicly traded company worth $5 million on the date of issuance and watching them decline to $1 million prior to the restricted sale period elapsing. As a result, it is appropriate to consider a discount for lack of marketability for restricted shares in publicly traded companies, as well, to capture the risk associated with potential changes in the price of the acquiring company's shares before the restricted sale period has ended.While acquirers go to great lengths to reduce their risks when purchasing a company, it is still very much a \"buyer beware\" world  -  hence the amount of time spent on due diligence before a transaction closes. When shares of the acquiring company are being issued as a portion of the deal consideration in an acquisition, however, the seller also must beware. In these cases, it is essential that both the buyer and seller accurately value the acquirer's shares, or one party may be left with something worth far less than what it thought it bargained for."

        "webpage": "Report Reveals Breadth of Criminal Tax Activities\nBack Report Reveals Breadth of Criminal Tax Activities Published February 25, 2014\nFrom shady tax preparation businesses to identity theft gangs to corrupt IRS agents, the IRS Criminal Investigation division's annual report reviewing its accomplishments in 2013 reveals the wide range of criminal tax activities it investigated in the past year. And, the report points out, despite a continued significant decline in staffing, the division maintained a conviction rate of more than 93%, which it noted \"reflects the quality of ... [its] casework\" (IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), Annual Business Report, p. 1).\nThe division's chief, Richard Weber, described 2013 as \"one of the most challenging years in recent memory,\" in the report's introduction. During FY 2013, the CI division started 5,314 cases and recommended 4,364 for prosecution, an increase of almost 18% over FY 2012, the report says. The report said the CI division's enforcement priorities for 2013 were:\nIdentity theft fraud; Return preparer and questionable refund fraud; International tax fraud; Fraud referral program; Political/public corruption; Organized crime drug enforcement; Bank Secrecy Act and Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) review; Asset forfeiture; Voluntary disclosure program; and Counterterrorism and the Sovereign Citizens group. The report contains a wide variety of case summaries from the division's investigations. Among the notable convictions in identify theft fraud, the division noted a case in Alabama in which a state employee stole information from state databases that was used to file more than 1,000 fraudulent tax returns claiming more than $1.7 million in false tax refunds. In another case, two Philadelphia men, who worked for a nonprofit agency set up to help the disabled, stole identifying information from their clients to file false tax returns. The Return Preparer Program investigates the \"orchestrated preparation and filing of false income tax returns\" (p.10). Among its notable cases was a scheme in which a defendant falsified income tax returns for hundreds of clients, including reporting false dependents, made-up businesses, and false education credits. Another case involved a tax preparer who invented home-based businesses for his clients that were used to claim deductions and credits the clients were not entitled to. The Questionable Refund Program is aimed at identifying fraudulent refund claims. Among its interesting cases was a prosecution of a tax preparer who solicited people whose information was used to file fraudulent telephone excise tax refund claims and first-time homebuyer credit claims. In another case, a now-former IRS employee threatened taxpayers that she would red-flag their returns and interfere with their refunds if they did not pay her a $400 \"fee.\" According to the IRS, the division's investigation of abusive tax schemes focuses on investigating promoters and clients who willfully participate in domestic and/or offshore tax schemes, usually by using trusts, foreign corporations, and partnerships to make it appear that a foreign trustee or nominee or a nonresident alien owns assets that are actually owned by a U.S. taxpayer. Among the prosecutions was a surgeon who attempted to evade more than $1 million in taxes using a web of entities in Ireland, Hungary, Cyprus, the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey.\nNonfilers investigated and prosecuted by the division included an economist in New York who did not file income tax returns from 1989 through 2010 and a Nevada couple who questioned the IRS's authority to tax them and failed to file returns and pay tax. The Illegal Source Financial Crimes Program prosecutes tax-related money laundering and currency violations, particularly individuals who derive income from sources such as embezzlement, bribery, and illegal gambling operations. The program prosecuted a mortgage fraud case in Texas and six people in Minnesota who were involved in a large bank and retail fraud scheme that spread to at least 13 other states.\nOne of the public corruption cases mentioned in the report involved former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison for conspiring to defraud his re-election campaign, and his wife, Sandra Stevens Jackson, was sentenced to 12 months in prison for filing false tax returns as part of the scheme. Another case involved a former Texas judge who was sentenced to 72 months in prison and ordered to pay more than $6.7 million in restitution after using his office to enrich himself through extortion, primarily by receiving payments for favorable rulings in cases before him.

        "webpage": "Q:\n\nWhy are there so many migrants in the modern world?\n\nI want to ask you if there is an explanation in your science of why there are so many migrants in the modern world? \nI live in Russia, and after the dissolution of the USSR a lot of people here had to leave their states (former Soviet republics) trying to find a job in Russia (where the economic situation is a bit better in comparison with the other republics). At the same time many people are trying to emigrate from the former Soviet Union to the West. \nWhen looking at the statistics I see that the situation with the employment in the former USSR is not the worst in the world, for example, according to this source, the unemployment rate in Russia is now 5.1%, in Uzbekistan 10.6%, and this is not so bad in comparison, say, with Spain, where it is 24.7%. However, the difference between 10.6% and 5.1% (together with some other parameters, like quality of life, etc.) force many people, millions of them, to seek a job abroad, and this is difficult for them (I am sorry for the normative statements).\nSo, to specify my question, \n\nWhat is the attitude of the economic theory to this? Is this considered as a result of an unsuccessful economic policy, i.e. of some mistakes in the reforms, or this is regarded as normal (maybe, inevitable)? And\n\nIf these were mistakes, then what were these mistakes? \nIf this was normal, then I suppose there must be an understanding in your science of what people should do in this situation. How does the economic theory expect the jobless people to react? Are they supposed to leave their countries, or wait, or die? If they are supposed to leave, then there appears a contradiction between economics and politics, since usually emigration is very, very difficult, often impossible because of the political reasons. How is this contradiction supposed to be resolved?\n\nFrom what I see in internet I got an impression that the situation in the former USSR is not unique, there are many other countries with similar problems, so, to tell the truth, I don't understand why people here insist that I should specify the country I am speaking about. If this is important, I have in mind the situation in Central Asia, i.e. countries like Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and around.\n\nA:\n\nAre current flows of migration bigger that they were in the past?\nWe tend to forget history because the numbers involved currently are smaller \nrelative to world population. For instance, the 8.8 million immigrants who came to the United States in 1901-1910 period is of similar magnitude to the 9.1 million immigrants who came in the 1991-2000 period, but both the U.S. and world populations were much larger than in 1901-1910.\nRichard B. Freeman in a nice paper, entitled \"People Flows in Globalization,\" reminds us about this fact. \nSome countries indeed receive large inflows of migrants\nThe US, Russia and Germany are the biggest recipients of immigration (see Table 1 in the above paper). These flows have consequences for factor endowment and there is considerable and often heated controversy over their impacts on destination countries.\nHow Do Immigrants Affect Their Countries of Arrival?\nFreeman examines this question (p.18 to 23) and reviews the empirics. In the basic model of immigration, immigrants reduce earnings of substitute factors and raise the earnings of complementary factors, where complements might include capital and some types of native-born labor. In the basic model, there is full employment but you may intuitively consider quantitative adjustments instead of price/wage adjustements by introducing frictions in the labor market. Note than in most advanced countries, \nimmigrants have higher unemployment rates and lower employment rates than native workers.\nRelated to this question a classical paper is \"The Economics of Immigration,\" with theory and evidence by Georges Borjas in Journal of Economic Literature, December 1994. More recently, in 2015, Borjas published an interesting review on Immigration and Globalization. You mal also be intereted in reading his paper on how the collapse of the Soviet Union affects the productivity of American mathematicians.\nRegarding policies Freeman  considers \"radically economic policies\" such\nas auctioning immigration visas or charging sizeable fees and spending the funds on current residents to increase the economic incentive for advanced countries to accept greater immigration."

By Scott Horsley\nJan 24, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Mary Jo White, then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, speaks during a May 2001 press conference following guilty verdicts in the trial of four followers of Osama bin Laden that bombed two U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998. President Obama intends to nominate White to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nDoug Kanter\nOriginally published on January 25, 2013 6:38 am President Obama's choice to head the Securities and Exchange Commission has prosecuted terrorists and mobsters. If she's confirmed, Mary Jo White's next challenge will be tackling reckless behavior on Wall Street. White, who spent nearly a decade as U.S. Attorney in New York City, would be the first former prosecutor to lead the SEC. She oversaw successful prosecutions in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and against mafia boss John Gotti, as well as numerous white-collar criminals. The White House highlighted that background in an apparent signal to would-be wrongdoers in the financial sector. \"Since she was such a tough prosecutor, and had an unwaving interest of extracting pretty good sanctions against individuals, it would be part of her DNA to expect that she'd want to see more individuals prosecuted,\" says James Cox, an expert in securities law at Duke University. \"Whether it's going to be successful (depends) on the political climate of the SEC and the ability to change an agency culture.\" Unlike the U.S. Attorney's office, the SEC prosecutes only civil cases, not criminal ones. Most of its cases end in settlements, often with no admission of wrongdoing. \"Unfortunately, the culture that's developed at the SEC over the last 15 to 20 years is a body-count process,\" Cox says, with a focus on settling a large number of cases, rather than individual penalties that might serve as a greater deterrent. The Obama administration says by nominating White, the president is showing his commitment to enforcing rules of the road on Wall Street. Many of those rules are still being written. The SEC is responsible for drafting rules to implement key parts of the 2 1/2-year-old law passed in response to the financial crisis. \"When the president signed the financial reform law, that was half-time,\" says Scott Talbott of the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry trade group. \"The legislators left the field and now it's time for the regulators to take over. And we are about halfway through the third quarter of implementation of a 2,000-page law.\" Financial firms have challenged the so-called Volcker Rule, which limits banks' ability to trade on their own behalf, as well as separate regulations designed to safeguard money market accounts. \"There is a tendency following a crisis to over-regulate,\" Talbott says. \"The pendulum rarely stops at the bottom. So we want to see that we don't over-regulate here.\" Since leaving the U.S. Attorney's office in 2002, White has served as a director of the Nasdaq stock exchange and also defended clients accused of financial fraud. She has fewer ties to Wall Street than some earlier SEC leaders, which could be a political advantage. \"Unfortunately, investor groups don't have the same influence on the Hill as does Wall Street,\" Cox said. The president also re-nominated Richard Cordray as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new agency designed to protect people from risky financial products. Last year, Obama used a recess appointment to install Cordray in the post over Republican opposition. The recess appointment expires at the end of this year.Copyright 2013 NPR. To see more, visit .

Mukri(202) 874-5770\nComptroller Dugan Tells Senate Industry is Fundamentally Sound, Credit Market Disruptions and Economic Slowdown Test Banks\nWASHINGTON  -  Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan told a Senate Committee today that while the banking system is fundamentally sound, it is being tested by large and unprecedented credit market disruptions plus the slowdown in the economy.\"Thus far national banks have been able to address a number of significant problems that have arisen while continuing to supply credit and other banking services to the U.S. economy - although there is no doubt that credit standards have tightened,\" he said in testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.The Comptroller cited the liquidity support a number of large banks provided to asset-backed commercial paper conduits and structured investment vehicles or SIVs - often involving the painful recognition of losses - to restore more normal funding in these markets.\"Likewise, banks with concentrated positions in collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime asset-backed securities have recognized large losses - but have also raised large amounts of capital to offset these and other losses,\" he said.However, significant market disruption issues remain to be addressed, such as the potential downgrades of monoline insurance companies; significant funding problems in the auction rate securities market; and severe constriction in the securitization markets for residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and leveraged loans, he said.In addition, the economic slowdown and problems in the housing market have led to significant increases in reserves banks carry for such assets as residential construction and development loans; home equity loans; and credit card loans, Mr. Dugan said. Community banks, with large concentrations in commercial real estate-and there are many of them-face real challenges in those parts of the country where real estate markets have slowed significantly.\"Unlike the unprecedented market disruptions of the last six months, these more traditional credit problems are familiar territory to bankers and supervisors,\" he said. \"The key to addressing them is for bankers to recognize problems early and manage through them, and that is exactly what our examiners are working with them to do.\"The Comptroller also said there is a need to reemphasize some fundamental banking principles, including sound underwriting, diversification of funding sources, strong internal controls and risk management, and timely recognition of losses.\"In each of these four areas - asset quality, liquidity, risk management, and reserves and capital - we remain alert to emerging trends and to findings that may trigger additional supervisory action,\" he said.The Comptroller also said that current efforts to address foreclosure prevention and mitigation are very important to the OCC, since the nine largest national banks act as servicers for about 40 percent of all U.S. mortgages, including a significant number of subprime mortgages.Mr. Dugan said the OCC has supported a number of important efforts, including the work of the HOPE NOW alliance, and noted that last week the agency launched a new initiative that would require the largest national banks to report key data on mortgages, including mortgage modifications.\"We are requiring our largest national bank servicers to provide standardized reports on a range of mortgage metrics, not just for subprime adjustable rate mortgages, but for all mortgages,\" he said. \"These data, which are consistent with the HOPE NOW metrics, will provide an important way to track mortgage performance against a broad range of indicators.\"Related LinksOral StatementWritten TestimonyComptroller of the Currency John C.

WASHINGTON, D.C.  -  President Barack Obama is letting his jobs council expire, cutting off one source of input from business leaders while unemployment remains stubbornly high.\nObama formed the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in January 2011, when unemployment was about 9 percent. It's now 7.8 percent, though more than 12 million people are out of work.\nObama's executive order establishing the council said it would go out of business Jan. 31, 2013. The White House said Thursday that Obama had no plans to renew its charter.\n\"The work of the jobs council was very valuable,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \"While the president didn't agree with all of its recommendations, he agreed with many of them and acted on a number of them.\"\nWhite House officials said Obama intended for the council to fulfill its mission and then wind down, and that he would seek input about the economy from business leaders in other ways. Among the steps Obama plans to pursue are expedited permits for public works projects, plus programs to boost entrepreneurship and workforce development.\nEven before Obama's decision was clear, Republicans seized on the council's likely expiration as evidence the president hadn't spent enough time on trying to create jobs, which is a priority for Americans. The Republican National Committee called it part of \"the failed Obama record,\" while the House Republicans' campaign committee, in an online petition, accused Obama of laying off his own jobs council.\nAdding to the concern about the job market's vulnerability, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December of last year, the first quarterly drop since 2009. The Federal Reserve said the economy appears to have \"paused in recent months.\"\nThe jobs council was a successor to an economic advisory board Obama created at the onset of his presidency. The panel was chaired by General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt and included prominent business leaders and economists. Immelt said Thursday that progress has been made on putting in place 90 percent of the council's recommendations.\nObama met with the council only a few times. During the last meeting, in February 2012, the president and the council highlighted an engineering education initiative alongside school deans.\n\"The president treated his jobs council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nThe council's main product was a report, \"Roadmap to Renewal,\" that was released in January 2012. The council also organized a series of meetings across the country last year with business owners, elected officials and academics; Obama didn't attend those election-year sessions.\nCritics have argued that the council's primary purpose was to create the appearance of action at a time when the nation was pining for something to rein in soaring joblessness. The administration acted on many of the council's recommendations, including suggestions to streamline permitting and small business loans, increase tourist visas and boost energy efficiency.\nBut the White House was at odds with several council members on tax policies, particularly a proposal to exclude overseas corporate earnings from U.S. taxes. That idea divided even the jobs council, whose membership included labor and Obama's political allies.\n\"It was helpful in terms of putting a spotlight on a variety of issues, but particularly helpful in the area of entrepreneurship,\" said AOL co-founder Steve Case, a member of the panel, in an interview. \"There's still work to be done, but we did make good progress.\"\nThe council's dissolution also comes as White House aides are optimistic about the prospects for a second-term detente with business.\nDuring Obama's first term, business leaders bristled at his harsh depiction of \"fat-cat bankers\" and his efforts to impose regulations, tax policies and spending initiatives they argued were unfriendly to business. Obama aides hope the warming of ties between the president and the business world can benefit the White House in future fiscal debates with Republicans.\nWhite House officials said the president made a fresh effort to reach out to business in the days following his re-election. Between the November election and the end of 2012, in the height of negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff,\" more than 400 business leaders, ranging from CEOs of large multinational companies to small business owners, met with Obama or his aides at the White House, officials said."

        "webpage": "While a well-publicized report has criticized New Jersey's liberal use of incentives dollars to attract and retain businesses, supporters call them a critical tool in competing for corporate tenants.\n\n\"The competitive environment in the post-recession period has really intensified,\" particularly when considered alongside lower-tax states like Pennsylvania, said James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.\n\n\"Other states have ratcheted up their incentive programs, so it's not surprising New Jersey has to respond,\" he said. \"I think most economists agree that everybody would be better off if we didn't have to apply these incentives, but you can't unilaterally disarm yourself. It's a debate without end.\"\n\nThe report, by the New Jersey Policy Perspective, found the volume of subsidy awards has skyrocketed since 2010. In the 1990s, New Jersey awarded an average of $3.9 million each month. From 2000 to 2009, it went up to $10.4 million, and in just the last three years, the average was $52.9 million a month. But despite the aggressive use of subsidies, the report says, post-recession job growth in New Jersey lags that of neighboring states and the nation.\n\n\"New Jersey now relies on a few mega-bets that move jobs around within the state to restore jobs and prosperity,\" said NJPP President Gordon MacInnes. \"It ignores the lessons from states that are taking our best jobs, that investments supporting research, educational opportunity, and improved infrastructure are much more productive.\"\n\nA spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie dismissed the report as a partisan attack, adding that the study fails to consider the disadvantage the state would be in without effective job retention and business incentive programs.\n\n\"This outfit is notoriously biased and consistently goes out of its way to fit an agenda,\" said Michael Drewniak. \"The business incentive and job retention programs they denigrate have long had bipartisan support and sponsorship. Also, let's take objective note of the record job growth during this administration concurrent to expansion of our incentive and job retention programs.\"\n\nThe numbers show New Jersey's private-sector job growth has increased along with the increase in subsidies. According to the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the state lost 107,000 jobs in 2008 and 115,700 in 2009. When the subsidies increased in 2010, 9,200 private sector jobs were added to the economy. That rose to 28,400 in 2011 and 59,100 in 2012.\n\n\"Clearly there is a strong correlation between job growth in 2011 and 2012 with the increased subsidies,\" Hughes said. \"Of course, there is a dilemma with the evaluations. Would the companies make the same move with or without the subsidy? There is no way to really tell that.\"\n\nState Sen. Raymond Lesniak (D-Union) has sponsored a number of incentives measures, and believes they work.\n\n\"New Jersey can't retain jobs and create new jobs without the tax incentives to offset the structured high cost of doing business in the state,\" he said. \"That includes the high cost of land, which is scarce; the high cost of cleanup of contamination, because of our industrial past; and the high cost of construction, because we believe in using union business trades to strengthen the middle class. All of those things put us at a competitive disadvantage with other states that don't have those costs.\"\n\nLesniak cited the Jersey Gardens mall, in Elizabeth, as a subsidy success story.\n\n\"That was an abandoned garbage dump,\" he said. \"Now it employs thousands of people and generates millions of dollars for the city of Elizabeth and for the state.\"\n\nLesniak said the business subsidy program was the only thing creating new jobs and keeping jobs in New Jersey during the recession, and is still vital in a state with a jobless rate above the national average. He also noted corporations must go through a vigorous process in order to receive these tax breaks, showing proof that there are viable and better alternatives for them out of state."

Tom Corbett and his legal staff are hoping fine distinctions in Pennsylvania case law will allow $12 billion in cuts to future pension benefits for more than 370,000 current state and school employees.\nCorbett and state legislators are grappling with Pennsylvania's unfunded pension liability of $41 billion, and the governor is taking an approach never before tested in state courts in hopes it will help the benefit reductions pass constitutional muster.\n\"We've designed our proposal in a way we believe it is constitutional, knowing that the likelihood is that that issue will ultimately be litigated in the courts,\" state Budget Secretary Charles Zogby said.\nMore than a month after Corbett announced his plan, drawing threats of lawsuits from labor unions, the legislative response has been cool and no bill has been introduced.\nThe benefit cuts are the main source of savings in Corbett's multipronged pension reform package and are expected to save an estimated $12 billion over 30 years. The package also would require new hires to enroll in a 401(k)-style plan, instead of the traditional plan, and temporarily limit annual increases in taxpayer contributions.\nThe governor proposes freezing benefits for current employees and replacing them with reduced benefits in 2015. When workers retire, they would receive the combined value of both sets of benefits.\nThe change for members of the Public School Employees' Retirement System would occur Jan. 1, 2015; and for workers in the State Employees' Retirement System, on July 1, 2015, officials said.\nFor current employees, the biggest single change in the governor's plan is a reduction in the \"multiplier,\" a percentage applied to an employee's years of service and final average salary to calculate pensions, typically from 2.5 percent to 2 percent.\nOver the years, Pennsylvania courts have issued numerous rulings that have established that public pension benefits are contracts and that the state constitution protects them against changes that \"impair\" that contract.\nIn a 1984 decision central to the current debate, the state Supreme Court overturned a legislatively approved increase in employee contributions. The justices said the increase represented an unconstitutional impairment of contract because it reduced a pension's value by forcing the employee to pay more for it.\nCorbett's legal team says past court rulings on contract impairment have weighed both the retroactive effect of benefit changes and the future impact. By freezing current benefits and locking in their value to employees, the lawyers hope to focus any challenge exclusively on future benefits - something they say neither the Legislature nor state courts has ever done.\n\"It's a brand new analysis for the court,\" said James Schultz, the governor's general counsel. \"In short ... the (state) Supreme Court would not be put into a position where it had to overrule itself on prior precedent.\"\nUnion leaders who have led the fight against the pension cuts said the novelty of the administration's approach doesn't fundamentally change the facts.\n\"Their legal theory doesn't make any sense to me,\" said Lynne Wilson, general counsel for the Pennsylvania State Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union.\nDavid Fillman, executive director of Council 13 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, reiterated that his union would challenge the proposal if the Legislature approved it.\nSen. Jake Corman, R-Centre, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the governor's plan would provide short-term savings to taxpayers but it would not make a significant dent in the already accrued unfunded liability. But he is similarly uncomfortable with such alternatives as pension bonds, which he called \"a risky proposition.\"\n\"It's a huge issue that has to be dealt with,\" Corman said. \"People are finally coming to the realization that there's no easy answer.\""

        "webpage": "How Much Credit Does Obama Deserve for the Stock Market Recovery?\nBy Derek Thompson\nThe president set the floor under the Great Recession. Multinational corporations used it as a trampoline.ReutersFor a president who is supposedly bad for business, Barack Obama has been surprisingly good for business. In his term, the S&P 500 is up 80%. The Dow has gained nearly 70% -- \"the fifth best for an equivalent period among all American presidents since 1900,\" according to the New York Times. How much credit does the president deserve for the stock market?Obama's inauguration interrupted a financial meltdown that had already destroyed a third of the Dow's value in 2008. There was catch-up growth to be had, but only after the president attended to the crisis. Some Obama critics claim the president talks too much about his first few months on the job. This is a little like telling a hero-firefighter to shut up, please, about the father, mother, baby daughter and seven kittens he rescued from that burning house, once. The president parachuted into the worst financial conflagration in 80 years, saw a million jobs disappear in his first two months, passed a stimulus, expanded TARP, instituted stress tests, and got the economy back to growing after only months. That is something to talk about and take credit for. The stimulus probably pulled growth forward a few months. But it's the stress tests -- and their implicit promise that government capital stood ready to rescue banks that couldn't find money in the private market -- that put a hard floor under the financial crisis. Years from now, when a fuller history of the government's response to the recession is written, the coordination between the Federal Reserve and the Bush/Obama administrations will likely go down as a hallmark of fast and effective crisis relief. The Obama administration clearly deserves credit as a part of that team.But what about the next three years? Some conservative critics have said Obama played a good firefighter but a bad executive. It is the economic version of the \"good war-time president/bad peace-time president\" argument.There is scarce evidence that the president's most important pieces of legislation -- financial reform and health care reform -- are having much of an impact on growth or employment. In fact, the most important drivers of growth or uncertainty are utterly out of the president's hands. Recently, China and Europe have scared multinational companies and hurt global trade. But there's not much a U.S. president can do to clear China's housing stock or badger the Germans into accepting higher inflation. Here at home, the president hasn't made much more luck in the persuasion department. Since the Recovery Act, the president has come up empty with pleas for more stimulus, settling instead for extending and expanding tax cuts passed under Bush.Most of the stock market growth in the last three years has occurred neither because of, nor in spite of, the president's policies. This shouldn't come as a huge surprise. The president controls one branch of government, the federal government accounts for merely one-fourth of GDP, and today the U.S. economy is merely a slice (albeit a big slice) of multinational companies' revenue pie.Most of the stock market recovery has reflected natural (if unsatisfying) growth both here in the U.S. and abroad, where U.S. multinationals are expanding and economies are growing sometimes twice or three times faster than the U.S. Weak job growth has helped to keep labor costs down and improved profits. Finally, in the last six months, the news from Europe and China has mellowed from quasi-apocalyptic to merely-extremely-concerning, and some of that relief has probably buoyed stocks.In the last two or three years, the market has been driven by catch-up growth, fairly strong global trade, a dash of medicine from Ben Bernanke and Co., and now (we hope) a real-honest-to-God housing recovery. The administration deserves tremendous credit for being part of\nthe team that oversaw the stabilization of the U.S. economy -- but it's not fully responsible for the jittery ascent (or, occasionally, jittery descent) of the stock market. Basically, Obama set the floor and some stocks used it as a trampoline.Update: Commenter FranklinDMadoff points out that German and UK stocks have tracked the U.S. fairly closely over the last five years. Here's that picture: [UK index in BLUE; German in GREEN; S&P in RED; Dow in PURPLE]I'd also point out that the European recession has created quite a bit of distance (up to 20%) between EU and US stock indices in the last two years.What do the synchronicity in the first graph and the gap in the second graph suggest?

The Eurodad network of European development groups also said nations desperate for cash are at a disadvantage in their dealings with the IMF, likening them to negotiating \"at the barrel of a gun.\" The IMF attached nearly 20 conditions on average to each loan it approved in the past two years, Eurodad found. That was more than the number the group had calculated in two prior reports. Many of the conditions also focused on politically contentious areas, such as public sector wage cuts or private sector reform, according to the report. Eurodad looked at the period from October 2011 to August 2013, covering 23 loans. In a 2011 review, the IMF promised to keep \"conditionality parsimonious and focused on macro-critical issues.\" The Eurodad report said: \"The IMF is going backwards - increasing the number of structural conditions that mandate policy changes per loan, and remaining heavily engaged in highly sensitive and political policy areas.\" The results were partly skewed by the biggest IMF loan programs during the period covered. Loans to Cyprus, Greece and Jamaica accounted for 87 percent of all funds approved, and had an average of 35 conditions each, Eurodad said. In the case of Cyprus and Greece, they were shaped by the IMF's European-dominated executive board, which demanded strict budget cuts in exchange for aid, said Eurodad's director, Jesse Griffiths. The report comes six years after the IMF's own internal watchdog urged the fund to dramatically reduce the conditions it attaches to loans, arguing they were not entirely effective. POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS The IMF's loan conditions have long been a sore point for many countries and grassroots groups, who have argued they are excessive and harmful to the poor. Many governments also complain IMF conditions are not well-tailored to country circumstances and political constraints, and may have unrealistic deadlines. They argue conditions reduce a country's ability to effectively control its economic programs. Griffiths said nations in dire straits are at a disadvantage in negotiating with the IMF. They are desperate to get cash and show financial markets and other donors that their policies have the IMF's seal of approval. For example, Ukraine had long resisted the IMF's conditions, but it finally agreed to them this year after saying it was close to default. Ukraine's prime minister said his government is on a \"kamikaze\" mission to make painful decisions. \"It's like at the barrel of a gun,\" Griffiths said. \"Those are decisions that are political and should be made in consultation with the people in those countries, and not through negotiations\" with the IMF. The IMF argues its conditions are necessary to put economies on the growth track, and ensure it gets its money back. Eurodad, however, found most countries were repeat borrowers. Twenty out of the 22 countries with new IMF programs from 2011 to 2013 had borrowed in the past decade, and a majority had borrowed in the previous three years. Some IMF conditions, such as drastic budget cuts that can weigh on an economy, may also make it more difficult for countries to repay their loans. The IMF in 2012 admitted it had miscalculated the economic cost of government austerity. Eurodad said deeper changes were needed, including overhauling the IMF's governance structure to give developing countries a bigger voice. The IMF in 2010 agreed to an initial step to boost the power of emerging markets, but the reforms have been held up by the opposition of the U.S. Congress.

(AP)  -  Jim Stowers Jr., the billionaire founder of one of the nation's leading investment management firms who gave away most of his fortune to fight disease, has died. He was 90.\nJim Stowers Jr.in a 2007 photo.\nThe Kansas City, Mo., philanthropist, whose tenacity in business was just as fierce as in his fight for stem-cell research, died Monday after a period of declining health, according to a news release issued by his namesake research firm and the investment firm he founded, American Century Investments.\nStowers was a struggling mutual fund salesman in 1958 when he founded Twentieth Century Investors Inc. with only two mutual funds and $107,000 in assets. That company grew into American Century Investments, one of the nation's leading investment management firms that, as of 2013, was managing about $141 billion.\nIn 2000, Stowers and his wife, Virginia, who both successfully fought cancer, promised more than $1 billion of their fortune to create the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City. The endowment eventually grew to $2 billion.\n\"I've always said that if I make other people successful, they'll make me successful,\" he told The Associated Press in 2009. \"We wanted to give something that was more valuable than money to the millions of people who made our success possible.\"\nThe gleaming institute has attracted world-renowned researchers to Kansas City and prompted civic leaders in the region to enhance collaboration between area research groups, health care organizations, universities and business interests.\nStowers and his wife said they wanted the institute to focus on basic research into how genes work, to determine ways to alter genes to fight such ailments as cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. But they faced skepticism from well-known U.S. research institutions about whether the Kansas City area could be a major player in biomedical research and life sciences.\nBy 2013, the institute had about 370 scientists, research associates, technicians and support staff.\n\"We were told that what we wanted to do couldn't be done here,\" Stowers told the AP in the 2009 interview. \"We had a whole bunch of labs tell us that they could do a better job than us.\n\"You know, I had the same statements made to me when I started American Century. I just said, 'I can prove it, I can do this.'\"\nStowers was born in Kansas City. He earned bachelor's degrees in art and medicine from the University of Missouri, and was an Air Force fighter pilot during World War II.\nHe and wife, Virginia, with whom he had four children, said they were motivated to help find cures by their bouts with cancer. Stowers was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1987, and his wife had surgery for breast cancer in 1993.\nStowers' efforts pushing stem-cell research sparked controversy in 2006, when state voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing that any federally allowed stem-cell research and treatment could occur in Missouri.\nThe Stowerses donated most of the $30 million spent by The Coalition for Lifesaving Cures, an organization formed to support the amendment, saying stem-cell research was important to the institute's efforts to fight disease.\nThe amendment was only narrowly approved, after a bitter political fight in which opponents claimed the use of embryonic stem cells for research required the destruction of a human embryo. Supporters contend the research does not end a life and had the potential to cure many debilitating diseases.\nTags: Obituaries"

Don't try to fix it without knowing the source of its success.\nTom Stinson at a recent news conference. He'll be succeeded by Laura Kalambokidis, a professor of applied economics at the University of Minnesota.\nPhoto: Glen Stubbe \u2022 Star Tribune, Star Tribune photo galleries\nMinnesota is economically stronger than you might think. Make that: Minnesota is economically stronger than Tom Stinson thought it was 26 years ago, when he moved into the humble office in the Centennial Building that says \"state economist\" on the door. Stinson has started vacating that office. A farewell party Thursday afternoon applauded his service and poked fun at his deadpan wit. Sometime next month, he'll quietly slip away to the similarly humble quarters at the University of Minnesota that, because the state economist job is part time, he never really left. He retires from his state job wanting Minnesotans to know what he discovered to his surprise in 1987 and holds is still true: Despite perpetual frets about the business climate and fears about job flight, Minnesota is in good economic shape. \"Minnesota is not broken,\" Stinson told me recently. \"That doesn't mean we can't do better in the future. But we have the luxury of making careful, considered decisions.\" Threats to Minnesota's prosperity lie ahead, he said. But if you think the big one is high taxes, he has a surprise for you. Here are excerpts of our conversation: Q: What did Minnesota do to build an economy stronger than even an economist like you expected? A: When I compared where we were in the 1960s to where we are now, one of the things that just jumped out at me is the improvement in the education of the workforce. It's just amazing, when you go back and look at it. It wasn't that we had bigger, faster machines or anything like that. It was the productivity of the worker. That's been the Minnesota competitive advantage. Q: So is the potential erosion of worker productivity the biggest threat to Minnesota's success? A: Yes, it is. We're going to have to have more output going forward. There's only two ways to have that  -  either more people making stuff, or the amount of stuff each person makes increases. You can push on the \"more people\" side by attracting and keeping workers in the state, but that only goes so far. More productivity is going to be needed, and productivity and education are closely tied. Q: High taxes aren't a big problem? A: We have never been a low-tax state. That's not our competitive advantage. Our advantage is the quality of our workforce. In order to keep that so, you have to have public-\u00adsector resources to make human-\u00adcapital investments. I've seen that bright 20- and 30-year-olds don't make location decisions based on tax rates. They think about the quality of life and the availability of amenities. Q: The natural growth in the population won't give Minnesota enough workers? A: No. The numbers show that we're not going to have much labor growth in the next couple of decades. We're in a situation in which we need to make the best use of the workforce that we have. With our aging population, we're in a funny situation. We don't have an extraordinarily high dependency ratio right now, that is, the ratio of people under 16 and over 65 to those in the workforce. But it's going to go up, and it's going to go up pretty substantially. The ratio was a lot higher in the 1950s and 1960s, because of the large number of children then. That was a problem that was going to solve itself. This problem isn't. We're not going to have 89-year-olds going back to work. But if we can make it easier for the mature worker to stay involved in the workforce longer, even if only by a little bit, that will do us good. Q: I like that description, \"the mature worker.\" What's needed to make that happen? A: I'm not sure state government can do a lot about this. But if there's a way we can encourage a better situation for the mature worker, that's going to be important for us. I'd tell employers, to the extent you are able to do this, you're likely to be more successful. Mature workers are often quite productive. They show up for work. read full article\nMore from Lori Sturdevant\nMinnesota's strengths, from one get-together to another That Senate office building has a bull's-eye painted on it A slight political bent to Farmfest get related content delivered to your inbox"

Email\nCommentThat's because lawmakers have yet to seriously address how to rein in the country's long-term debt. And that broader debate will involve significant policy changes: A likely overhaul of the federal tax code and a reduction in spending across the board.Policymakers have been mostly mum on the issue. By December, however, they will have a harder time ignoring the matter, since they will have in hand reports from the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force and President Obama's fiscal reform commission.Both panels will starkly lay out the magnitude of changes needed to correct for two unpleasant realities.The first is a combination of habit and circumstance. For years, the country was spending more than it was willing to pay in taxes, and then it was hit by a gob-smacking economic and financial crisis that spurred a lot more spending to stem the pain of the downturn.The second reality, however, is more worrisome to budget experts. Even after the economy recovers, the gap between money out and money in will persist largely because of long-anticipated demographic changes such as the aging of the population. And borrowing to fill that gap could become much more expensive than it has been.Deficit hawks: A dangerous trajectoryThis year, U.S. debt held by the public, which does not include money owed to Social Security and other government trust funds, will top 60% of the country's economy as measured by gross domestic product. By 2022 it is projected to reach 100%. And by 2035, it's on track to approach 200%. By comparison, the average debt held by the public between 1960 and 2000 was just 37%, according to information from the debt reduction task force.The large leaps in indebtedness mean, among other things, that by the end of this decade, the vast majority of all federal tax revenue will be swallowed up by just four things: Interest payments on the country's debt, and the payment of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits.By 2021, the cost of annual interest payments alone would top that of the defense budget and itself eat up more than half of all federal taxes, according to information from the debt reduction task force.On tap: The call for sacrificeGetting the federal ledger on a more stable track means that future legislative dogfights won't be about what breaks to offer voters so much as what sacrifices to ask of them.0:00\n/5:18Higher taxes loom for the rich\"If we have not asked Americans to sacrifice, we have failed,\" said former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who co-chairs the debt reduction task force with Alice Rivlin, the former White House budget director under President Clinton.\"And if we have asked you to sacrifice and you choose not to do it, we've failed again because we haven't convinced you that this is one of the few ordeals facing America that is as bad as being in a war,\" added Domenici, who used to head the Senate Budget Committee.The task force, and the president's commission, have said that the entire federal balance sheet is on the table. And they're both likely to recommend spending freezes, a serious curtailment of many tax breaks and various reforms to entitlement programs, to name just a few.Still, neither Domenici nor Rivlin believes the effort to deal with the country's long-term debt will be all spinach and no sugar.\"In every major problem that a great country like ours has, there is a silver lining,\" Domenici said. His group, for instance, will propose ways to simplify the federal tax code, which both parties have wanted to do for a long time.Whether Congress chooses to adopt either group's suggestions is impossible to say. Many deficit hawks believe it will take nothing short of a crisis for Congress to act. A crisis such as the fall of the dollar, loss of confidence in U.S. ability to pay what it owes, rampant inflation, or a sovereign rating downgrade.Rivlin is more optimistic. \"My hope is that after the [mid-term] election, both parties will see the advantage of working together to get part of this problem behind them,\" she said. \"I believe people are sensible enough to come to grips with this problem long before we're facing a downgrade of U.S. debt.\" Print\nCBO chief: Budget outlook daunting U.S. debt: When is it safe to start cutting?

Back in 2011 he said that the U.S. was marching into a recession. And in late 2012, he said that the recession started in mid-2012.\nAlthough the NBER hasn't yet told us the economy went into recession, Achuthan is sticking to his call. Below is Business Insider's exclusive Q&A with Achuthan. The transcript went out to subscribers of our \"10 Things You Need To Know Before The Opening Bell\" newsletter on Thursday morning. Sign up here to get the newsletter and more of these bonus items in your inbox every day.\nBUSINESS INSIDER: What's everyone getting wrong about the state of the economy right now?\nLAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN: By second-half 2013, GDP growth was clearly picking up, but key ECRI leading indexes were weakening, pointing to decelerating growth, well before the weather began to worsen. In other words, the second half rebound was unlikely to persist the way a cyclical recovery typically does. So the weakness in U.S. economic growth goes far beyond the weather, and is likely to resurface after the post-weather bounce.\nThat's why, in January, with a near-universal consensus that U.S. growth was about to \"take off\" and reach \"escape velocity,\" we dissented, saying on CNBC that \"We just don't see that when we're looking at the data.\"\nA case in point is ECRI's U.S. Leading Construction Index (USLCI), based on which we reported last summer that, with \"construction sector growth poised to fall further, there are few drivers of a near-term rebound.\" Sure enough, year-over-year (yoy) growth in new home sales has plunged deep into negative territory, while yoy investment growth in residential structures has also tumbled, with both at their worst readings in nearly three years.\nBecause both peaked long before the bad weather, it's evident that their cyclical downturns aren't really about the weather, and were correctly anticipated by the USLCI growth downturn, which has actually worsened since last summer. So the popular belief that housing will help drive an acceleration in U.S. growth this year will turn out to be a pipe dream.\nBI: What do you think is the most worrisome sign in the economy?\nLA: While the consensus keeps predicting an economy at \"escape velocity,\" with sustained 3%-plus growth, the reality remains far short of that, with yoy GDP growth hovering around 2% - what one quickly-forgotten Fed paper had called the economy's \"stall speed.\" Meanwhile, business investment remains elusive and - as ECRI correctly predicted last summer - construction is decelerating, not accelerating, posing risks to the economy now highlighted by Janet Yellen.\nIn fact, demographics, along with productivity growth averaging less than 1% for the last three years, have helped keep U.S. trend growth so low that the inevitable growth slowdowns are more likely to end in recession. This is the hallmark of the \"yo-yo years,\" characterized by more frequent recessions than most expect. There's no indication that this era will end soon, even if we see occasional 3%-plus GDP growth quarters, given that even Japan in its \"lost decades\" has seen 3%-plus GDP growth in 30% of the quarters since 1990. BI: What do you think is the most underreported story in the economy?\nLA: The steepening downturn in home price growth has been obvious in recent months, with yoy growth having peaked last spring for median new home prices, and last summer for median existing home prices. We predicted this downturn months in advance, over a year ago, and we expect it to continue.\nBI: You've previously argued that the U.S. economy went into recession in 2012. What's the status of that call?\nLA: In hindsight, the epicenter of the recession looks to be the half-year spanning Q4 2012 and Q1 2013, which saw just 0.6% annualized GDP growth, mostly from a jump in agricultural inventories. GDP growth for those quarters could easily end up negative after revisions, much of which tend to arrive years after the fact. Nevertheless, just looking at the data in hand, yoy GDP growth during that period fell to lows never seen away from recessions in over half a century. We'll see how the revisions change the picture in retrospect.\nFollow 10 Things Before the Opening Bell and never miss an update!\nSubscribe to 10 Things Before the Opening Bell and never miss an update!\nLakshman Achuthan of the Economic Cycle..."

        "webpage": "Islamic finance must widen global links\nGMT 06:34 2012 Wednesday ,06 June\nRiyadh - Arabstoday\nIslamic Development Bank Group President Ahmad Muhammad Ali yesterday called for integrating Islamic finance with real economic activities of trade and industrial production. Through such integration, finance could be directed toward real activities rather than used for the build-up of unbearable debt or harmful speculation. \"From this perspective, international connectivity will help nations build their economies and diversify their investments,\" Ali said at the 3rd Annual World Islamic Banking Conference (AWIBC) Asia Summit in Singapore.\nThe Jeddah-based IDB Group is a global multilateral development institution with 56-member countries from Asia, Africa, Europe and America.\nThe two-day event featured an inaugural address by Ravi Menon, governor of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, followed by a keynote session addressed by Ali and Halim Alamsyah, deputy governor, Bank Indonesia.\nMore than 450 key players and thought leaders in the international Islamic finance industry attended the summit including Jaseem Ahmed, secretary-general, Islamic Financial Services Board.\nThe AWIBC: Asia Summit is one of unique platforms which aim to foster greater connectivity between Asia and the Middle East thus providing an opportunity for key industry players in these high-growth markets to develop the capacity to structure large-scale multi-currency and cross-border Shariah-compliant transactions.\nIn his presentation on \"Strengthening International Connectivity to Enable Further Growth of the Islamic Financial Industry,\" Ali said the conference organizers have chosen an important topic of \"Strengthening International Connectivity; Islamic Finance: Capturing Cross-Border Opportunities.\"\nThe subject is relevant at a time when countries worldwide are facing the repercussions of the continuing global financial crisis. \"I thank the organizers for this vital opportunity to discuss these critical issues at a global level,\" he said, adding: \"I am confident that, with the prominent participants in this event, valuable contributions will be made that will guide the Islamic financial industry through the coming decade.\"\nMenon said in his inaugural speech that Islamic finance had shown remarkable resilience during the last five years  -  perhaps the most challenging economic environment in the post-war era. The industry has grown by an estimated 20 percent annually in the last five years to reach $1.3 trillion in total assets in 2011. Islamic banks have grown both in number and scope. But the sustained growth of Islamic finance is in no way guaranteed. For Islamic finance to continue thriving, the industry has to overcome a few key challenges. But in every challenge, there is also opportunity.\nTalking on Islamic finance in the era of deleveraging, Menon explained that the clear and present danger to all financial activity, including Islamic finance, is the risk of contagion from an escalation of the euro zone crisis. Islamic finance is closely intertwined with underlying economic activity and will be affected by the impact of slower global growth. Contagion from the euro zone has already curtailed economic growth and capital inflows to many emerging economies where Islamic finance has taken root.\nBut Islamic finance, he continued has a window of opportunity in the current climate of deleveraging in the global financial system. With its strict prohibition on excessive leverage, Islamic finance has been spared the worst of the financial crisis. Islamic banks are well positioned to reach out to new customers who are in need of financing as many global institutions pull back on their lending due to the need to repair their balance sheets, he said.\nIslamic finance should diversify into growth areas such as trade and infrastructure financing, where demand is still strong, especially in emerging economies. With a focus on supporting real productive activities, Islamic finance is naturally compatible with trade and infrastructure development. Tapping these sectors also brings about greater diversification benefits, especially for Islamic institutions, which have been hurt by their significant lending exposure to the real estate sector, he added.from arab news."

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers, click the \"Reprints\" link at the bottom of any article.\n\nThe Alternative Wave Theory - Catching Up With Stephen Todd Walker\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer & Co.\n\nRecord volatility in recent weeks means more clients are looking for downside protection, and non-correlated assets are a major way to go. But too many alternative asset classes failed to perform as expected in the market implosion in 2008, leaving investors frustrated and skeptical. What's to be done? Stephen Todd Walker, formerly with Deutsche Bank Alex.Brown and now managing director at Oppenheimer & Co., was named to Barron's list of top 1,000 advisors due in part to his strategic (and successful) use of alternatives. His new book, \"Wave Theory for Alternative Investments,\" takes on three asset classes in particular: venture capital, commodities and hedge funds.\n\nHe sat down with Investment Advisor to talk about the wave theory: what it is and how members might benefit from understanding its ebb and flow.\n\nWhat's the elevator pitch for the wave theory?\n\nYears ago, I was with Deutsche Bank Alex.Brown, which is a firm that is very involved with alternatives. I noticed if I added alternatives it decreased risk and increased return. I also noticed, over and over again, the same patterns seem to revert to the mean. For example, if I was to say I know someone who bought a house, flipped it and bought two more houses with the proceeds and then overextended and went bankrupt, you'd say, \"Sure, that was, like, three years ago.\" Actually, I was referring to 1922, when there were 30,000 realtors in the Miami-area alone. Similar patterns have happened in real estate between then and now. So that's an example of what the wave is: patterns, cycles and trends that occur in different alternative asset classes.\n\nAbout the only asset class that performed to expectations as truly non-correlated were managed futures. Given that generally poor performance, does the term \"alternative investments\" turn the public off?\n\nDepends on the time period you're talking about. Many didn't perform to expectations. But managed futures were up 14.09% during the worst of the last market downturn, and hedge funds were down significantly less than the equity markets as the equity market got creamed. And those were abnormal times.\n\nBut isn't that what alternative investments are for, to protect against abnormal markets?\n\nHedge funds, for instance, go short by their very nature, yet the government banned the shorting of 1,000 companies. And hedge funds borrow from banks. Suddenly, banks and firms like Lehman Brothers got into trouble and said, \"Give me my money back.\" That will affect performance.\n\nMoney manager Peter Schiff recently said that the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen are no longer currency havens for investors and gold is the only alternative left. Do you agree?\n\nWe had a situation in the 1970s that was not dissimilar to what we're experiencing now. In 1973, gold was at $106.48. In 1979, it rose to $459 and in 1980 it was at $594.90. Just one year later, in 1981, it fell to $271.04 and it stayed there until 2001. Is there more to eke out in the current run-up? Possibly, but the standard deviation has doubled in volatility from as recently as March 2009 and gold is at a 10-year high.\n\nIs there a case for alternative investments in the distribution phase, or do they carry too much risk?\n\nIt depends on the individual investor. But if we're talking simply about risk, there was quite a bit of risk experienced with traditional securities, including money market funds recently. I am a big fan of bonds, but even investors in low-risk bond funds lost 50% in the last downturn. I think a case can be made for alternatives in retirement portfolios, but it will depend on which ones, because there's plenty of garbage out there.\n\nIs the book for advisors as well as investors or is it more of an introduction to alternative investments and what they offer?\n\nBoth. My experience is that there are a lot of advisors who don't have a good grasp of alternatives. There are 500 pages in the book, so there's plenty of information for everyone. There are two chapters specifically on gold, which makes it very topical. The book really expands on hedge funds, venture capital investments and commodities. It provides the history, performance and risk of each, as well as the vehicles that can be used to gain access to them. Lastly, it lays out each alternative's advantages and disadvantages, and discusses the \"wave theory,\" or the concept that all securities move in patterns, cycles and trends. Investors should be cognizant of these waves to possibly lower risk and maximize returns when adding alternatives to their portfolios.\n\nSign up now - it's Free!\n\nSponsor Showcase\n\nThinkAdvisor's TechCenter is an educational resource designed to give you a competitive edge by keeping you abreast of new tech innovations and need-to-know information that can be applied to your business.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nAt Prudential Advisors, we're dedicated to helping all our clients get on the path to achieve their goals.\"Prudential Advisors\" is a brand name of the Prudential Life Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries"

        "webpage": "Markets & Economy The yield curve: What it is and what it means\nJuly 22, 2013 \ufffd\nHide the transcript\nTRANSCRIPT Normal\nThis is how a yield curve is built. Along the bottom it shows bond maturities. On the vertical axis you see interest rates, or yields. Now, let's say that a two-year bond is offering a yield of 2.5%, and a five-year bond is offering 2.7%, and a ten-year bond offers 3.3%, and so on. When you connect all these dots, what you get is the yield curve. This is a typical yield curve. What makes it typical isn't the yield figures. Instead, it's the shape of the curve. A typical yield curve can start anywhere, but it will generally have a shape something like this, with a gradual rise from left to right. That's because people who invest at shorter maturities aren't taking on as much risk as others. So, they normally don't get paid as much. And that's true along the line.\nThis is a flat yield curve. Of course, the term \"flat curve\" doesn't seem to make much sense, but that's the way economists talk about it. When the yield curve looks like this, with short-term rates about the same as long-term rates, it's generally a signal that there's a lot of uncertainty about the outlook for the economy, interest rates, and inflation. In fact, this is the yield curve on July 1, 2007, just a couple of months before the financial crisis began.\nThis is an inverted yield curve with short-term interest rates higher than long-term rates. An inverted curve shows that the bond market is under stress because it essentially means that investors are being paid more for taking less risk. Inverted curves are not usually very dramatic looking, but they can be. For example, here is the yield curve from September 14, 1981.\nThe short answer is not much in terms of your own investing. It can help provide context for interest rates, and it's a useful tool for economists and portfolio managers. But the yield curve, no matter what shape it is, is not a critical consideration for long-term investment planning. If you hold a broadly diversified bond portfolio, you'll probably have exposure to all parts of the yield curve. \ufffd\nHow to make sense of the yield curve\nThe yield curve is one way to look at interest rates. It shows the rates - or yields - offered by bonds of different maturities.

Keep up with what's happening in Washington via the AARP Blog\nJoin AARP Today  -  Receive access to exclusive information, benefits and discounts\nAfter a $6 billion campaign and a post-election tug-of-war, President Obama still sits at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue, with a Republican-majority House and Democratic-controlled Senate at the other end. Financial markets and public opinion have made it clear they want leaders to work through four potent dishes  -  reducing the debt, energizing the economy, implementing the health care law and actually cooperating.\nAs the president begins his second term and Congress reconvenes this month, a unique blend of motivation and opportunity exists in abundance. For one thing, none of the Washington politicians has to worry about partisan elections this year. For another, countries such as Greece and Spain have shown the sorts of social and economic upheaval that result when a nation doesn't preemptively tackle its fiscal imbalances. With that dynamic, \"it's possible to get some things done now that were not possible before,\" says Allan Meltzer, professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon University and a fellow at the Hoover Institution.\nFew people understand the issues better than G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. For 33 years, Hoagland worked on Capitol Hill, with a unique vantage point as staff director of the Senate Budget Committee and as a top aide to former Senate Republican leader Bill Frist. Hoagland says that he has never seen so many crucial issues come together at once  -  including the temporary budget that runs out in March, the need to raise the nation's debt limit and the \"fiscal cliff\" deadline. The fiscal problems are so big and so fraught, he says, the two parties will finally be forced to work together for a change. \"It's going to force us back into the old bipartisan way in which we used to get work done around here,\" he says. \"I see coming out of this better policies to address the challenges our country faces.\"\nRepublicans and Democrats each have favorite ingredients  -  the GOP is pushing for cuts to spending, including Medicare and Social Security, and Democrats want higher taxes for the wealthy. An AARP Bulletin poll found public support for raising taxes to close the deficit, strengthen Medicare and Social Security, and finance schools and highways, but skepticism that agreement can be struck. The coming months will show whether lawmakers can compromise to come up with what many experts say is needed  -  a federal budget that is $4 trillion smaller over the next 10 years than the $44 trillion it would be under current law.\nNow is the time for action. If the two sides don't come to an agreement, the consequences are significant. \"Debt will continue to balloon. We are borrowing one-third of everything we spend right now,\" says Isabel Sawhill, a budget expert at the Brookings Institution.\nThe Federal Budget and You\nSome of the options on the table could have far-reaching impact on older Americans. Advocates have argued that Social Security, with its own funding source, shouldn't get drawn into the debate over the deficit. And Medicare's projected spending already was trimmed as part of the health care reform bill. But economists and political scientists on both sides of the ideological divide say no major work will be done on the nation's fiscal problems without including both more tax revenue and cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security.\nThe long list of options to be considered for Social Security includes raising the retirement age beyond the current limit of 67 and raising the cap on wages (now $113,700) subject to the payroll tax. While some Republicans advocate a long-term plan of premium support for Medicare, other Medicare adjustments being debated include raising the eligibility age from 65 to 67; raising the premiums paid by wealthier recipients; more closely linking Medicare costs to inflation; and aligning costs with medical outcomes instead of medical services provided.\nNext page: Tinkering with the tax code. \""

        "webpage": "Term Sheet\nWhat really has the 99% up in arms\nby Geoff Colvin\nShare icons It's not that the rich are getting richer. It's that the rest of America isn't.\nThe most important fact to realize about the rash of popular protests around the world  -  Occupy Wall Street in the U.S., demonstrations in Greece, Spain, London, and elsewhere in Europe, violent uprisings in rural China, even the revolutions of the Arab Spring  -  is that they aren't about money or inequality. If they were, they'd be easier to deal with. They're about perceived injustice, which reflects a deeper, fiercer problem.\nThe spark of the U.S. movement may soon be obscured as it's taken over by career protesters, labor unions, and others who enjoy any chance to torment corporate managers. But the spark is where we find what's new and meaningful, and it seems to have emanated from a feeling by the protesters that they aren't getting a fair shot at prosperity. They believe that big companies, specifically major banks, have rigged the system to their own benefit and to the suffering of ordinary people.\nThat perceived injustice is the real root of today's rage. Yes, many Wall Street executives make tons of money, but plenty of hedge fund managers, for example, make far, far more, yet no one is camping outside their suburban Connecticut offices. For that matter, America loves Warren Buffett, just as it loved Sam Walton when he was the country's richest man. Fellow citizens making billions do not by themselves get many people riled.\nEven economic inequality isn't enough to send mobs into the street. Inequality in the U.S. has been increasing for over 30 years. During most of that period the rich were getting richer, and the poor were getting richer, but the rich were getting richer faster. Though the gap was widening, the lid stayed on discontent as long as everyone was moving ahead. Inequality actually diminished in the recent recession, as it usually does in tough times. If inequality were the problem, people would be less upset today than they were in 2007.\nBillionaire parties are still raging\nWhat's new is that those with medium and lower incomes have not been getting richer for several years, while those with high incomes have been, and the unprecedented slowness of post-recession job growth has left many feeling deprived of their rightful opportunity to improve their lot. More broadly, they feel they're being punished even though they did nothing wrong, while those whom they blame for the whole mess  -  the bankers  -  got bailed out and are raking it in. Infuriating injustice.\nThe elements are the same in protests worldwide, whether the specific grievance is blatant corruption, as in China and the Middle East, or violation of the social compact, as in Europe. The innocent are punished while the guilty are rewarded. That combination is intolerable.\nIn the U.S. this narrative is flawed and in some ways plain wrong. Most of the Occupy Wall Street protesters probably don't know that they, as taxpayers, actually made money from the bank bailout. They may be forgetting that millions of Americans are being foreclosed on because they willingly, even eagerly, took out mortgages they couldn't afford. Some protesters are simply clueless, like one who responded to a question from the New York Times by saying he'd never heard of Warren Buffett, or one who complained to NPR that \"we're paying for the bailout,\" or one who told the Times that the airline Virgin America is a good company because it's \"working on creating solar planes.\"\nIt doesn't matter. What people know or don't know isn't important. All that counts is what they feel.\nAt a private meeting of movers and shakers a few years ago, a CEO presented the facts on the long-term diverging fortunes of the wealthy and the middle class in the U.S. Henry Kissinger, who was chairing the meeting, observed that the situation held the makings of \"a social and political cataclysm.\" It seemed an overly dramatic pronouncement, but he was right. Only a feeling of powerful injustice was missing, and now it's here.\nEven if Occupy Wall Street should evaporate, the fuel that's feeding it will not. Think of it as a warning. Cataclysm is a long way off, and it certainly isn't inevitable. But we're a little bit closer.\nThis article is from the November 7, 2011 issue of Fortune.\n\u2190 Should you include volunteer work on a resume?

These analyses are supported with the most up-to-date and comparable data for over 300 indicators covering 32 topics, grouped into eight themes: demographic trends, health, education and knowledge, poverty and insecurity, women's empowerment, environment, economy, and connectivity. Expansion of Global Value Chains in Asian Developing Countries: Automotive Case Study in the Mekong Subregion1 Dec 2013Journals During the past three decades, the development of highly integrated global value chains in which products are supplied, manufactured and distributed across national boundaries have created a new form of division of labour among Asian economies, especially in North-East and South-East Asia. The rapid growth of global value chains has dramatically changed production patterns, international trade and foreign direct investment in the region, with a notable expansion of intraregional trade through multiple border crossings of parts and components. Shifting from quantity to quality: Growth with equality, efficiency, sustainability and dynamism1 Dec 2013Flagship publications and book series Conventional growth strategies have reduced poverty. People now have more access to basic services and more opportunities for mobility and participation. But there are still persistent unmet needs, widening inequalities, and new development challenges such as climate change, intensifying natural disaster and resource depletion. There is a search for growth strategies that better fit a changing economic, social and environmental reality. Technical paper: Sound Practices in Space Technology Applications for Disaster Risk Reduction and Inclusive and Sustainable Development26 Nov 2013Journals Asia-Pacific is the most disaster-prone region of the world. In recent years, it has faced a series of multiple exogenous shocks that transcend geographical boundaries and endanger our communities. The poor and the vulnerable are the ones most affected. Despite the rapid economic growth in the region, many developing countries are increasingly vulnerable to disasters, and the magnitude and frequency of extreme disasters are estimated to rise due to the effects of climate change. This necessitates building resilience of the region to extreme disasters in multidimensional ways. Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2013: Turning the Tide: Towards Inclusive Trade and Development22 Nov 2013Flagship publications and book series The present document is based on the forthcoming Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2013 (henceforth the Report), which is the main substantive document prepared for the third session of the Committee on Trade and Investment. The Report comprises two parts. In the first part, there is a focus on trends and developments in trade in merchandise and commercial services, foreign direct investment flows, performance in trade facilitation, and reliance on preferential policies and trade agreements from an Asia-Pacific perspective. Asia-Pacific Population Journal Volume 2821 Nov 2013JournalsAsia-Pacific Population Journal Volume 28 was released in 2013. A Decade of Building Regional Co-operation in Trade and Investment20 Nov 2013Books ESCAP focuses on a number of areas of economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific. One of these is trade and investment - a vital engine for growth and integration. Recent decades have seen an enormous expansion in trade and investment flows in the Asia-Pacific region. Regional economies are increasingly part of global value chains. This has helped foster the economic dynamism that has lifted many from poverty and spread prosperity more widely. At the same time, however, too many individuals and communities remain excluded from the benefits of trade and investment. Review of Developments in Transport in Asia and the Pacific 20137 Nov 2013Flagship publications and book series While transport has been an essential element in the rapid growth and economic development of Asia and the Pacific, the sector is now at a crossroads more than ever before. Rocketing demand for transport services is putting extreme pressure on existing infrastructure at a time when public budgets are constrained and awareness about the negative externalities of transport activities is growing. The challenge is therefore to ensure that today's transport policies and investments will contribute to a sustainable and inclusive development path for the future. Dealing with challenges for making trade inclusive 1 Nov 2013Working paper series Trade has the potential to contribute to economic growth and to more and better jobs. Whether trade contributes to growth that is inclusive, in the sense that all people can contribute to and benefit from growth triggered by trade, is likely to depend on country specificities including institutional pre-conditions and policies applied in domains other than trade. This paper identifies specific challenges for making trade inclusive and identifies ways for dealing with them.\nThe Vanuatu Cocoa Growers' Association: Inclusive Trade in Rural Smallholder Agriculture 1 Nov 2013Working paper series The Cocoa Grower's Association (CGA) in the Republic of Vanuatu is a fundamental example of how the organization of local cooperatives can make a significant impact and create an environment for inclusive trade. This paper will review a case study of implementing a governing association that coordinates cocoa cooperatives in Vanuatu, and which is focused on organizing the production and trade in the region, as a method to highlight key lessons learned and potential for scalability in furthering inclusive trade goals.

Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. - (Courtesy of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia)\nThe president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said Friday that after four years of keeping interest rates low, the central bank may have troubling preventing inflation once a stronger economy signals a shift to a less accommodative monetary policy, which he said could happen in 2014.\nCharles I. Plosser told a bankers conference in Somerset he is forecasting that the nation's unemployment rate could decline to near 7 percent by the end of 2013, and that the Fed's target is to keep rates low until the jobless rate falls to 6.5 percent. \"We must guard against the medium and longer term risks of inflation\" when the Fed begins to unwind the low-rate policies in place since the 2008 financial crisis.Plosser said, \"Business balance sheets are in pretty good shape, and they are actually borrowing a lot because the money is cheap, so they do have cash. But historically business investment is not as sensitive to interest rate movements as a lot of people think it is. Actual business fixed investment doesn't move around that much with interest rates.\"Plosser said that while low interest rates provide an incentive for business investment, \"something else is holding (business) back - either a lack of demand or uncertainty.\" He said businesses need households to be healthy to provide the demand for goods and services that drives business investment - but ironically, households are saving more to rebuild the wealth they lost in the housing downturn and the recession, while the current low interest rates are making it difficult for households to rebuild their wealth.Plosser addressed more than 500 people at the Economic Leadership Forum of the New Jersey Bankers Association at the Palace in Somerset. The association released its 2013 economic survey of New Jersey bankers, which found that two out of three respondents believe both the national and state economy are in \"fair shape.\"Bankers also reported that loan demand is improving, with two out of three saying current loan demand is fair or good, and predicting increased demand over the next six months for both commercial real estate and commercial lending. But nearly all cited the lack of qualified borrowers and the lack of demand as the largest obstacles to new business lending.John E. McWeeney Jr., president of NJBankers, said, \"New Jersey banks have the capital, the liquidity and the appetite to invest in New Jersey's future.\"Plosser, whose bank oversees southern New Jersey, said New Jersey's unemployment rate is 9.6 percent, while the U.S. jobless rate is 7.8 percent. \"(Hurricane) Sandy was not an insignificant factor in the unemployment rates, and New Jersey still has some challenges. I think it will gradually come down, but right now New Jersey has higher than national average unemployment.\"At some point the Fed will reverse course and begin to gradually increase interest rates, Plosser said. \"The Fed has always found it easier to lower rates than to raise them. It is much more politically acceptable: the Fed gets a lot of pushback when it tries to raise rates.\"On Twitter: @bethfitzgerald8\nBeth Fitzgerald\nBeth Fitzgerald reports on health care, small business and higher education.

        "webpage": "The Economics Profession Doesn't Understand How The Economy Works\nIn the 1980s, a couple of ambitious young economists thought ski lift operators weren't very smart. The economists assumed that if the business owners charged more on busy days, they could make more money. As recounted in \"Knowledge and the Wealth of Nations\" by David Warsh, the economists saw long lines on busy days as \"prima facie evidence of market failure.\"\nAfter study, Robert Barro and Paul Romer concluded that they were wrong and that the people running the business were right. On crowded days, skiers waited longer in line and enjoyed fewer runs. As economists put it, the customers were paying more per ride even though the daily fee was the same. The business owners probably didn't think of it that way, but they knew how much to charge.\nBarro and Romer deserve credit for eventually acknowledging that fact. However, many economists today believe they know how businesses work better than those who run them. The problem is that no economist can account for all the variables so they simplify problems, make assumptions and often miss the point.\nRecently, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development admitted that their own projections had missed the impact of globalization, fragile banks, and government regulation. The result, as summarized by the Washington Post's Robert Samuelson: \"Not only did the OECD miss the 2008-09 financial crisis, but it routinely overpredicted the recovery's strength.\"\nThis is nothing new. Following World War II, there was widespread speculation that the U.S. would enter a new Depression. Instead, the nation enjoyed the greatest economic growth in the history of the world. One study showed that economic models failed to account for 85 percent of the growth.\nThis track record is worth keeping in mind while listening to any political debate about economic projections. Recently, the Congressional Budget Office claimed that President Barack Obama's proposal to raise the minimum wage might eliminate 500,000 jobs. The White House attacked that report by citing other economists who said the plan would not eliminate any jobs.\nRealistically, both estimates are probably wrong. More importantly, they're probably leaving out the biggest impact of the law, just as earlier economic models missed 85 percent of the factors leading to the post-War economic boom. It's not that economists are foolish; it's that an economy of more than 300 million people responding as best they can to daily life will react in ways that are unpredictable.\nRecognizing that most minimum wage workers currently get a raise within a year, some businesses might respond by keeping workers at the new minimum for a longer period of time. Others might trim their profits a bit while a different group might trim the pay of those who earn a bit more than the minimum. There could be other positive or negative feedback as well. The point is that nobody really knows. Debates about economic projections are like an episode of \"Seinfeld\"  -  a show about nothing.\nRather than betting the farm on unreliable projections, a pragmatic approach would seek reliable data through experimentation. Let states and cities set their own minimum so workers can compare results. Just like ski lift operators who figured out the best way to attract customers, states would quickly figure out the best way to attract workers to their state.\nThe results are likely to surprise the economists.\n: Getting a Grip on Realities of the Federal Budget"

But a modest improvement in economic growth helped narrow the gap by $207 billion compared with last year.The Treasury Department said Friday that the deficit for the 2012 budget year totaled $1.1 trillion. Tax revenue rose 6.4 percent from last year to more than $2.4 trillion, helping contain the deficit.The government's revenue rose as more people got jobs and received income. Corporations also contributed more tax revenue than in 2011.Government spending fell 1.7 percent to $3.5 trillion. The decline reflected, in part, less defense spending as U.S. military involvement in Iraq was winding down.\nBarack Obama's presidency has now coincided with four straight $1 trillion-plus annual budget deficits -- the first in history and an issue in an election campaign that ends in 3 weeks.Obama's Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, contends that Obama failed to achieve a pledge to halve the deficit he inherited by the end of his first term.When Obama took office in January 2009, the Congressional Budget Office forecast that the deficit for that year would total $1.2 trillion. It ended up at a record $1.41 trillion.The increase was due, in part, to higher government spending to fight the worst recession since the Great Depression. Tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to the deficits.\nThe budget gaps in 2010 and 2011 were slightly lower than the 2009 deficit as a gradually strengthening economy generated more tax revenue. But the deficits still exceeded $1 trillion.Obama is campaigning for a second term with a pledge to cut deficits by $4 trillion over the next decade. He says he would do so by ending the Bush-era income tax cuts for higher-income Americans and by restraining the growth of spending.Romney has said he would cut spending growth to help narrow the budget gap. He would cap spending at 20 percent of the economy by 2016. Spending in 2012 accounted for about 23 percent of the economy.The government borrowed about 31 cents of every dollar it spent in 2012. The string of $1 trillion-plus deficits has driven the national debt above $16 trillion. The magnitude of that figure has intensified debate in Congress over spending and taxes but little movement toward compromise.Many fear the budget deadlock will send the economy over a \"fiscal cliff\" next year, when tax increases and deep spending cuts will take effect unless a budget deal is reached.Obama wants to eliminate the income tax cuts for families that make more than $250,000.Republicans in Congress and Romney have resisted. They argue that with the economy still weak, the government should not be raising anyone's taxes.\nCongress may address the budget crisis during a lame-duck session of Congress after the November elections.\nW.Va. man who shot himself was gun instructor\nFour WVU students, others charged in postgame riots"

        "webpage": "Could Forrest Gump Plan Our Economy?\nBy Scott Mayer\nNo one of sound mind would ever entrust the enormously complex U.S. economy to a small group of leaders who collectively possess the intellect of Forrest Gump. But can an assemblage of genius-level central planners really bring us any closer to \"utopia\" than a much less intelligent group of dopes?\nPresident Obama, Paul Krugman, Democrats, and the mainstream media all believe in a top-down approach to government, where economic activity is \"fairly\" dictated by a handful of \"best and brightest\" elites. They believe that the \"average\" citizen isn't smart enough to make the \"correct\" decisions with regard to something as \"complicated\" as the economy.\nEconomists such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Thomas Sowell would point out that the decisions necessary to run the U.S. economy (or any economy, for that matter) are so numerous and so complex that the combined intelligence of even the smartest thousand individuals falls incredibly short of what would be needed to undertake such a task.\nI wanted to see how this would look on paper, so I created two charts to help to contrast the differences, if any, between these two schools of thought. In chart one, the first group uses the fictional character Forrest Gump, who had an IQ of only 76, and is composed of 1,000 individuals with that same level of IQ. The second group comprises genius-level individuals -- Nobel Prize laureates such as Paul Krugman. Not knowing Krugman's IQ, I'm really giving him the benefit of the doubt by placing him in a group with 999 other geniuses and giving them an estimated average IQ of 154 (notice I didn't include Pelosi, Reid, Schumer, Chris Matthews, or even Bill Maher in this group):\nThere is a very clear definition between the Gump and Krugman groups, which leaves no doubt as to which is the more intelligent. But let's introduce a third group into the mix, the free market, which comprises the entire U.S. population (where even an infant knows best which jar of mush it prefers to eat) with an average IQ of 98. Let's see how these three groups stack up against each other in combined brainpower:\nIt's clear from the second chart that the group with the IQ of Forrest Gump has nowhere near the brainpower necessary to run our economy. But in the movie, Gump sure did seem to flourish in the free-market system. And he certainly didn't whine about life not being \"fair,\" like Obama so often does. Perhaps a sequel should be made with Gump trying to survive in North Korea for contrast?\nLooking at the Krugman group, it's clear that when compared to the collective brainpower of the U.S. population, the former don't possess nearly enough intelligence. So why should we place our trust in these elites? Bill Whittle explains the reason why we shouldn't in a way that even Gump would understand during the second video from his must-watch What We Believe series.\nOf course, the Krugman, et al. elites will still find it necessary to point out how much smarter they are than the Gump group. But at the scale on the second chart, it's nearly impossible to tell the difference between the geniuses and the dopes using the unaided eye. I don't want these geniuses to feel too terrible about their intellect, so to help them attempt to prove the relevance they provide to the free market, I'd like to offer this simple tool:\nThe left would have us believe that society can function at its optimum level only through their brilliant dictates. The truth is that they wouldn't be able handle the complex nuances of coordinating children's sack lunches on a national scale, let alone control the rest of the economy. In fact, according to Milton Friedman, these elites would have a hard time making a pencil (especially without public funds) to save their lives. The stupidity of these brilliant elites lies in their not recognizing that they can't change human nature and that the highest possible standard of living comes from the collective brilliance and power of the free market. Then again, maybe they do understand...\nHistory has proven that without trusting and utilizing the collective intelligence of the free market, you end up with collective misery for all except the elites who are pulling the strings. Maybe these elites aren't so stupid after all? It seems they've found an easy way to loot all of life's \"finest chocolates\" right out of someone else's box.\nScott blogs at ."

Firstly, the paper reviews trends in trade flows and trade patterns between the selected economies, and by using several trade performance indicators it finds the level of trade still relatively low. It then discusses the possible reasons for this state of affairs.

This will provide the foundation for Asian common markets and facilitate the creation of an eventual pan-Asian community. None of this will be easy, but it will have to be done by building institutions, harmonizing policies and regulations, developing and aligning standards, and, most crucially, attracting the required capital to the right kinds of regional projects.

Poverty rates among the old have dropped, and many retirees can now look forward to a comfortable retirement, funded in part by their Social Security benefits. However, the system's ability to provide future retirees with a comparable retirement income has been called into question, and plans that would fundamentally change the system have been proposed. When the Social Security System was established in 1935, it envisioned the creation of a large reserve fund to ensure the continued financing of the system. Benefits were not scheduled to be paid to those reaching the age of 65 until 1942 and were to be based on total lifetime earnings of contributors. Before the first dollar was paid out, the system was amended in 1939. Benefits were to begin in 1940 and would be based on average earnings over a minimum covered period, thereby raising the benefits received by the average worker. In addition, coverage for a retiree's dependent children and spouse were added. These changes resulted in an increase in initial payments made by the system and eliminated the idea of building up a reserve fund. Social Security became grounded as a pay-as-you-go system-contributions made by current workers would be transferred in the form of benefits to current retirees. Current workers then would rely upon their children's generation to finance their retirement benefits. When Social Security was established, it covered only workers engaged in commerce and industry (excluding railroad workers), about 60 percent of the workforce. Over the years, most notably in the 1950s and 1960s, coverage was expanded so that today 96 percent of all jobs are covered by Social Security. There are five categories of excluded workers: 1) federal civilian employees hired prior to 1994; 2) railroad workers (although the railroad retirement program is coordinated with Social Security); 3) state and local employees, if they are covered under a separate retirement program (currently 25 percent of state and local workers are excluded); 4) household and farm workers whose earnings are below some minimum requirement; and 5) self-employed workers with earnings below $400 a year.1 Over the years, the types of benefits have expanded, particularly relating to dependent coverage and survivors. Disability coverage was added, and early retirement programs were instituted. In addition, the benefit formulas were changed, resulting in increases in benefits for all retirees. Thus, while the average single worker who retired at age 65 in 1940 received benefit payments in that year equal to 26 percent of his pre-retirement wage, the average single worker who retired at age 65 in 1997 received benefits payments in that year equal to 45 percent of his pre-retirement wage.2 Not only have the benefits received by retirees been rising, but the number of years a retiree is likely to receive benefits has risen due to increases in life expectancy A person retiring in 1940 was expected to receive benefits for 12 years, if a man, and 13 years, if a woman. In contrast, a person retiring in 1997 is expected to receive benefits for 16 years, if a man, and 19 years, if a woman. The increasing generosity of the Social Security system and the increase in life expectancy have added to the cost of financing the system. While benefits have risen, so too have the tax rates necessary to fund these benefits. Social Security tax rates are split equally between employer and employee. In 1935, the combined tax rate was 1 percent of wages. Today the combined tax rate is 12.4 percent.3 Demographic and economic changes have raised concerns about the ability of the system to maintain the current levels of generosity without further increases in taxes. With declining fertility rates, the potential growth of the labor force is declining. Furthermore, declines in the rate of productivity growth since the 1970s have reduced the growth in real wages and thus payments. ...

Moody's Investors Service weighs in today, saying the new law increases corporation default risk, and offering an explanation of how the law might work. From Moody's:\nPuerto Rico's new debt relief law provides a clear path to default for public corporations and signals the Commonwealth's diminished willingness to support public corporations that have historically relied on the commonwealth's general tax revenues to pay for operating deficits and borrowing needs. The law places ratepayers, pensioners, and public employees ahead of investors holding over $20 billion in public corporation debts. Under current law, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Ba2, negative) and its public agencies cannot file for bankruptcy. The new law invokes the commonwealth's police powers in an effort to protect public services and provides a formal process by which debts can be modified, amended or exchanged.\nFollowing an eight year long recession and despite continued fiscal austerity, the commonwealth and its public corporations remain financially stressed, with high leverage and weak liquidity. In that context, the new law provides for the orderly enforcement of and restructuring of public corporation debts. The three largest public corporations  -  Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority, Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority and Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority - have a combined $20 billion of bond and bank debt outstanding. All rated debt is Ba3, review for downgrade.\nThe law allows debt restructuring if a public corporation is facing financial distress and cannot satisfy operating expenses, debt service obligations and continuity of vital public services. It establishes two channels for restructuring and includes elements that are common in US municipal bankruptcy. Under chapter 2 of the law, debt relief can take the form of amendments, modifications, waivers or exchanges, and may include interest rate adjustments, maturity extensions, or revisions to affected debt instruments. Debt relief must be part of a recovery program that demonstrates the public corporations will become financially self sufficient and that allocates the burdens of consensual debt relief equitably among all stakeholders. A majority of debt holders must agree to the relief package in order for the new terms to be binding on all holders. Such a debt restructuring is subject to court approval.\nToday's Wall Street Journal says Franklin Templeton and OppenheimerFunds, both big holders of Puerto Rico debt, have mounted a legal challenge to try to block the law."

Gordon\nNBER Working Paper No. 847 (Also Reprint No. r0372)\nIssued in 1982\nNBER Program(s): EFG\nArthur M. Okun's last book, Prices and Quantities, contributes a theory of universal wage and price stickiness, but provides no explanation at all of historical and cross country differences in behavior. The core of this paper provides a new empirical characterization of price and wage changes over the last century in the U.S., U.K., and Japan, in order to demonstrate the wide variety of historical responses that have occurred. Equations for changes in the GNP deflator, in the hourly manufacturing wage rate, and in the real wage rate are estimated, with attention to the influence of both demand and supply disturbances. Because of the long sample period involved, extending back to 1875 for the U.K. and to 1892 for the other two countries, there is extensive attention to shifts in parameters. My description of U.S. data differs from Okun's framework by rejecting his wage-wage formulation of the postwar U.S. inflation inertia process, by allowing the impact of demand disturbances to depend on both the level and rate of change of aggregate demand, by allowing demand to influence price- setting as well as wage-setting behavior, and by stressing the fact that inertia in the U.S. adjustment process is purely a postwar phenomenon rather than the universal fact implied by Okun. The results for the U.K. and Japan com- pound the conflict with Okun's analysis, since in these two countries wages have been far from sticky, even in postwar years. Prices and wages were particularly flexible in the U.S. during World War I and its aftermath, in Japan since 1914, and in the U.K. since the mid-1950s. The last half of the paper provides an analysis of behavior in labor markets and product markets. The unique nature of the U.S. postwar adjustment reflects its unique institution of three-year staggered wage contracts, and the analysis attempts to explain why we do not observe perfect insulation of nominal wages from shifts in nominal demand. The section on the product markets examines the factors that explain why prices are often pre-set, and why the speed of adjustment to demand shocks is sensitive to the nature of aggregate information available.\nThis paper is available as PDF (520 K) or DjVu (404 K) (Download viewer) or via email.\nPublished: Gordon, Robert J. \"A Century of Evidence on Wage and Price Stickiness in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan.\" Macroeconomics, Prices, and Quantities, James Tobin, editor, pp. 85- 133.

SEC May Cap Leverage for Brokers\nFunding rules under consideration would be designed to prevent runs on broker-dealers.\nBy Dave Michaels, Bloomberg March 20, 2014\nU.S. regulators worried that banks and brokerage firms remain too dependent on risky types of short-term funding are weighing new rules designed to reduce reliance on parts of what is often called the shadow banking system.\nNow the SEC is weighing new funding rules for brokers as well as a limit on leverage similar to those used by the Federal Reserve and other regulators for banks, according to a regulatory document and SEC officials familiar with the matter.\nThe initiatives are aimed at financing tools such as repurchase agreements, or repos, that were relied on by Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. until their failures accelerated the 2008 financial crisis. Lehman's bankruptcy provoked criticism of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for lax oversight of investment banks.\n\"We all learned during the crisis that the shadow banking system, of which broker-dealers are a part, is subject to runs just like banks,\" said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland who served as a Treasury Department assistant secretary during the crisis. \"What seems like highly liquid collateral can turn illiquid during the next crisis.\"\nFederal Reserve officials have warned for years that the $4.5 trillion web of repo deals remains prone to unravel during a panic, potentially leading to fire sales of assets that could spread losses across the financial system.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said last year that the SEC's current rules for broker-dealers haven't changed enough since the financial crisis.\nThe SEC oversees broker-dealers, the largest of which are owned by big banks supervised by the Fed. Wall Street's largest bond dealers became heavy users of the Fed's emergency-lending facilities during the crisis. Their borrowing via two programs peaked at $401 billion on two separate days in September 2008.\nThe broker-dealer units of banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. would be affected by the proposal, as would firms such as Leucadia National Corp.'s Jefferies Group LLC that aren't within Fed-regulated holding companies.\nIn an effort to head off regulators, Wall Street banks and industry groups are developing a proposal to have a third party, such as the Fixed Income Clearing Corp., process and clear transactions. That would reduce the risk brokers face from a trading partner's default.\nRaising Cash\nBroker-dealers use repos, or repurchase agreements, to raise cash to finance their inventory of assets and to provide short-term funding to clients such as hedge funds. For instance, a broker-dealer receives cash in return for collateral, typically Treasury bills or notes, that it has the obligation to repurchase at the original price plus interest. If a broker isn't able to renew the agreement, it can be forced to sell other assets to get needed cash. Roughly 45 percent of large banks' trading portfolios are funded by repos, according to an October 2013 report by Citigroup Global Markets Inc.\nFederal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said last month that regulators may want large, complex banks that house broker-dealers to hold more capital or rely more on longer-term funding. The $71 trillion shadow-banking system, which includes the $4.5 trillion market for U.S. repos, still isn't adequately protected by regulation, Tarullo said.\n\"We have yet to address head-on the financial stability risks from securities financing transactions and other forms of short-term wholesale funding that lie at the heart of shadow banking,\" Tarullo told the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 6.\nOne measure of a broker's indebtedness is the ratio of its assets to capital. U.S. broker-dealer leverage reached 40-to-1 in 2007 before falling to 22-to-1 in 2012, according to the most recent annual report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an umbrella group of U.S. regulators led by the Treasury Secretary. Broker-dealers' leverage is still \"significantly higher\" than that of commercial banks, according to FSOC.\nBrokers contend that their borrowing is generally less risky than bank lending. Repo borrowing, for instance, is backed by collateral that can be readily sold to raise cash in case the other party defaults, said Steven Lofchie, co-chairman of the financial services group at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP"

        "webpage": "Tax VOX Why we need a better corporate income tax\nThe current US corporate income tax in effect imposes a fee on companies that are publicly traded. The tax is neither efficient nor progressive. By Chris Sanchirico, Guest blogger /\nFrank Franklin II/AP\nFloor traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday in New York. The US corporate income tax effectively puts a fee on companies that are publicly traded, which is neither efficient nor progressive.\nSuppose someone proposed a special tax on businesses that make their ownership shares publicly available in affordable, easy-to-sell units. Such an idea would probably generate a lot of push-back. Efficiency advocates might complain that it taxed the very attributes that make equity markets efficient. Progressivity advocates might object on the grounds that it taxed those who have no alternative to publicly available investment opportunities.In fact we already have such a tax. We call it the corporate income tax.\nIn what sense is the corporate tax a special levy on being publicly traded? And what do we know about the policy implications of such a charge?\n tax moves to protect yourself from the fiscal cliff\nCorporate earnings are taxed twice: First at the corporate level, then again as dividends when they are distributed to shareholders or as capital gains when those investors sell their shares.But not all businesses are double taxed in this manner. The earnings of certain businesses - commonly referred to as \"pass-through entities\" - are taxed only once, at the individual level.At one time, businesses that wished to be taxed as pass-throughs had to give up certain legal benefits of the corporate form, including the concept of \"limited liability\" that bars creditors from going after the owner's personal assets. Alternatively, they had to qualify as special \"Subchapter S corporations,\" which strictly limited their ownership structure.Now, businesses have available to them alternative forms that replicate many of the legal benefits of the corporation, impose none of the requirements of Subchapter S, and yet avoid corporate tax. Limited liability companies and limited liability partnerships are two prominent examples. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the share of business receipts generated by these pass-through entities has more than doubled since 1980.But there is still one circumstance in which a business cannot avoid the double tax. No matter its legal form, a firm is taxed as if it is a corporation if its ownership interests are publicly traded. (Entities whose earnings consist almost entirely of \"passive type income\" are exempt from this rule.) A firm meets Treasury's definition of \"publicly traded\" if it is listed on an established exchange or otherwise makes its ownership rights publicly available in affordably small, readily salable units.CBO reports that more than three-fifths of all business receipts are still earned by corporations. It is likely that many have not converted to pass-throughs because, wishing to remain publicly traded, there is no benefit to doing so.\nThus, the corporate tax is a tax on being publicly traded in the following sense: there is no real reason for a business to pay it unless that business is publicly traded.Understood in this way, the corporate income tax would appear to have important implications for the progressivity and efficiency of the tax code. But those consequences are largely unstudied.Consider, for instance, progressivity. One hypothesis worth considering is that the existing corporate tax is more regressive than a general tax on business investment because the corporate tax is borne more heavily by those who have no alternative to publicly available investment opportunities.Unfortunately, existing research on who pays the corporate tax has little to say about hypotheses of this kind. That literature, which has been nicely summarized by my Tax Policy Center colleague Jim Nunns, has been primarily concerned with how the market shifts the corporate tax burden away from its original legal placement - for example, onto workers as lower wages.But the literature makes counterfactual assumptions regarding the place from which the burden is shifted. The central economic model assumes that certain goods must be produced in corporate form, and that - for at least some consumers - such corporate-specific goods have no close substitutes. This is what gives the corporate tax its bite in the model.But what really gives the corporate tax its bite is that it is effectively a fee on being publicly traded, and that - for at least some businesses and investors - publicly traded ownership has no close substitute.While the original legal placement of a tax burden is not the whole story, it is part of what determines who bears the ultimate economic burden. In recent years, we have learned a great deal about how statutory burdens translate into economic burdens. The next big challenge for students of corporate tax incidence will be to apply those lessons to the actual statutory burden that is the modern corporate income tax.\nTen tax moves to protect yourself from the fiscal cliff\nTax VOX Business tax reform can't ignore $800 billion in 'pass-through' revenues\nCorporate tax reform will hurt small business, unless ...

        "webpage": "The fiscal cliff: What it means\nAuthor: Matthew Smith, Good Morning El Paso Weekend Anchor / Reporter\nABC-7s Matthew Smith reports\nEL PASO, Texas - When President Barack Obama greets congressional leaders at the White House on Friday, an elaborate set of postelection rituals will be complete. Yet divided government's ability to attack the nation's economic woes is no clearer now than it has been for months.Eventually, something's got to give in a country where voters are weary of gridlock and wearier still of high unemployment.Or does it?\"I'm open to compromise and I'm open to new ideas,\" Obama said at his White House news conference on Wednesday. He stressed the importance of avoiding the \"fiscal cliff,\" a double whammy of tax increases and spending cuts at the turn of the year.But he made it clear he would be flexible only to a point.He referred more than once to his defeat of Republican Mitt Romney, saying, \"I argued for a balanced, responsible approach, and part of that included making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay a little bit more.\"\"By the way, more voters agreed with me on this issue than voted for me,\" he added, a reminder to Republicans that some of their supporters, too, disagree with the party's position.House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, also regularly stresses a willingness to reach across the aisle, citing the emergence of a \"spirit of cooperation\" since the election that he says bodes well for an agreement.Like Obama, he avoids definitive answers to hypothetical questions.\"I don't want to box myself in. I don't want to box anyone else in,\" he said recently.What unfolds on Capitol Hill in the coming weeks will likely have a real life effect on people throughout the Borderland. According to John Sonnen, the president of Lauterbach Financial Advisors, spending on a Federal level will trickle down to El Paso.If the two sides can't come to terms by Jan. 1, a series of across-the-board spending cuts take effect -- a combination known as the \"fiscal cliff\" that many economists say could send the economy back into recession.The fiscal cliff is tied to \"sequestration\" another term likely to be heard in the coming days. It means the government would have to stop payment on a multitude of payments. The laundry list of items would likely include defense cuts, meaning job losses and ultimately a negative effect on the economy.For the average taxpayer, that means financial planning. Younger people have time to build a portfolio, so it likely won't effect them unless a severe crash occurs causing job loss. Most economists believe the political parties would make an agreement before it gets to that point. However, older generations who remain on fixed income have to be more concerned about the market uncertainty ahead. Sonnen said that's why financial plans are needed. Without one a person can find themselves living from crisis to crisis.\"A proper plan builds in that uncertainty,\" said Sonnen. \"Those who fail to plan, this always feels like some major event they're unprepared for.\"But there is hope this isn't over yet -- that Republicans and Democrats will make a pact before time expires.Despite the claim of a dual mandate, Boehner has signaled the end of efforts to repeal Obama's health care legislation, a cause that animated the tea party and united Republicans who swept to power in the House two years ago.Numerous Republicans in Congress and among the nation's governors say the party must appeal more effectively to Hispanic voters, who account for an ever-increasing share of the electorate and gave Obama more than 70 percent of their votes this fall. Already there are the first stirrings of compromise talks on an overhaul of immigration law, to include a pathway to legal status if not citizenship for millions who are in the country illegally.The \"tone and rhetoric\" employed by Republicans in recent debates over immigration have \"built a wall between the Republican Party and Hispanic community,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. conceded a few days after the election.So much for Romney's statement in last winter's primaries that illegal immigrants can self-deport.Immigration legislation will wait until 2013 at least.By then, Obama and Congress will show whether the election produced a government more inclined to compromise, or to more gridlock.\nCopyright 2016 KVIA.

        "webpage": "Stocks plunge after election; Europe woes deepen\n/ Article NEW YORK (AP) - With the election now behind, investors shifted attentions to the challenges facing the U.S. and global economies. Analysts say the risk of the looming \"fiscal cliff\", a series of tax hikes and spending cuts set to take effect at the first of the year, is weighing on the market mood. Stocks declined from the opening bell on Wall Street. At midday, the Dow was down more than 300 points. The key stock market averages were down more than 2 percent. Energy and banking stocks have seen some of the biggest declines. Those are industries that might have faced less regulation if Mitt Romney had won. Stocks seen as benefiting from President Barack Obama's decisive win rose. They included hospitals, free of the threat that Romney would have rolled back Obama's health care law. Fitch Ratings warns Obama must get deficit deal Fitch Ratings says President Barack Obama must pivot off his re-election victory and quickly forge an agreement with Congress to prevent a series of tax increases and spending cuts that kick in next year. The credit rating agency issued a statement saying the president will have \"No Fiscal Honeymoon.\" Fitch says Obama must work toward a credible plan to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff or risk losing the federal government's top 'AAA' rating next year. The agency changed its outlook for the U.S. rating to negative last year after Congress and the Obama administration failed to meet a deadline for a plan. They face $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts that go into effect on Jan. 1. The government's failure to come up with a plan to reduce the deficit led Standard & Poor's to cut its rating of long-term U.S. Treasury securities last year from 'AAA' to 'AA+'. It was the first-ever downgrade of U.S. government debt. Fitch says Obama and Congress also must reach a deal on raising the nation's borrowing limit. Treasury Department officials have said they expect the government to hit the current borrowing limit of nearly $16.4 trillion at the end of the year unless Congress votes to increase it. The U.S. debt stood at $16.16 trillion as of Oct. 31. The U.S. has never failed to meet its debt obligations. The battle over raising the debt limit in August 2011 went to the last minute before a compromise was reached. EU: Eurozone recession to be worse, rebound slower The European Union warns that Europe's economy is still reeling and unemployment could remain high for years despite the progress made in solving the debt crisis. It has downgraded next year's forecasts for the 27-country bloc. The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has revised down its forecast for the region's gross domestic product. It now looks for GDP growth of 0.4 percent in 2013, compared to its expectations last spring of 1.3 percent growth. The commission had previously expected the 17 countries that use the euro to find its footing next year, with 1 percent growth. Now it predicts only a 0.1 percent uptick. The report also suggests that unemployment won't start falling until 2014 - and then only slightly. The downbeat forecast helped erase an initial euphoria in markets over President Barack Obama's re-election, with markets in France and Germany losing more than 1 percent. The eurozone has made progress this year toward resolving its debt crisis, which has been dragging down economies throughout the EU and beyond. Countries that use the euro have slashed spending and promised to keep their deficits in check. They've vowed to better protect their banks by improving how they're regulated and supervised. The European Central Bank has put in place a plan to help countries struggling with high borrowing costs, the hallmark of the crisis and the reason some have sought bailouts.

        "webpage": "Q:\n\nDistribution of Black-Scholes option price\n\nConsider a Black-Scholes formula for option pricing on conditional interest rate $r=0$ for European call option. Let's write it as $BSCall(\\sigma)$ and investigate it as a function of unknown non-random constant volatility.\nWe can look at historical asset price data and compute sample variance $s$ which distribution law depends on unknown true $\\sigma$. It has an important property of $\\dfrac{(n-1)\\text{s}^2}{\\sigma} \\sim \\chi_{n-1} ^2$.\nDue to MLE plug-in property we know that if $\\hat{\\sigma}$ is an MLE for volatility $\\sigma$ then $BSCall(\\hat{\\sigma})$ is an MLE for Black-Scholes price.\nBut this is just a point estimator. Is there any approach to compute the variance or confidence interval (HDI) for option price under volatility estimated with sample variance?\nI tried to use a trick from expected-value-of-black-scholes but it seems to be incorrect since rewriting $\\sigma = \\dfrac{(n-1)\\text{s}^2}{\\chi_{n-1} ^2}$ brings some exogeneous uncertainty by sampling Chi-squared.\n\nA:\n\nI think the easiest way to to what you want is to use confidence intervals (statistical inference).\nIn other words, assuming the population has a true variance $\\sigma$, the sampling distribution of the variance $s^2$ of an $n$-sample verifies:\n$$ \\frac{s^2(n-1)}{\\sigma^2}\\sim \\chi^2_{n-1}$$\nYou can exploit this result to build an $1-\\alpha$ confidence interval for the population variance ($\\alpha \\in [0,1]$, typically $\\alpha=5\\%$). \nIndeed, for a confidence level $1-\\alpha$, the following equality holds:\n$$ z_{\\alpha/2} \\leq \\frac{s^2(n-1)}{\\sigma^2} \\leq z_{1-\\alpha/2} $$\nwhere $z_q$ figures the quantile $q$ of a chi-squared distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom i.e.\n$$ X \\sim \\chi^2_{n-1},\\quad \\Bbb{P}(X \\leq z_q) = q $$\nGiven a sample variance $\\tilde{s}^2$, one can therefore turn the inequality on its head, to write, for a confiedence level $1-\\alpha$:\n$$ \\frac{\\tilde{s}^2(n-1)}{z_{1-\\alpha/2}} \\leq \\sigma \\leq \\frac{ \\tilde{s}^2(n-1)}{z_{\\alpha/2}}  $$\nHence the upper and lower bounds of your $1-\\alpha$ confidence interval for the (unobserved) population variance:\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma^+ = \\frac{ \\tilde{s}^2(n-1)}{z_{\\alpha/2}},\\quad \\sigma^- = \\frac{\\tilde{s}^2(n-1)}{z_{1-\\alpha/2}} \n\\end{align}\nThis could then help you construct $1-\\alpha$ confidence bounds on the BS option price given the measure sample variance $\\tilde{s}^2$:\n$$ V^+ = \\text{BSCall}(\\sigma^+),\\quad V^- = \\text{BSCall}(\\sigma^+)$$\n\n[Edit]\nGiven your desire to obtain a full distribution, why not opt for a Bayesian approach?\nAssume the true population variance $\\sigma^2$ follows a certain prior distribution with hyperparameter $\\alpha$, $p(\\sigma;\\alpha)$ over $\\Bbb{R}^+$.\nSuppose that, for a specific sample, you measure a sample variance $s^2$ and wish to compute the posterior of the population variance. Bayes' rule gives:\n$$ p(\\sigma^2 \\vert s^2, \\alpha) = \\frac{p(s^2 \\vert \\sigma^2)}{\\int_0^\\infty p(s^2 \\vert \\sigma^2) p(\\sigma^2;\\alpha) d\\sigma^2 } p(\\sigma^2; \\alpha) $$\nNow you know:\n\nThe prior distribution $p(\\sigma^2; \\alpha)$: you postulated it. \nThe sampling distribution $p(s^2 \\vert \\sigma^2)$: $\\quad s^2 \\sim \\sigma^2/(n-1) \\chi^2_{n-1}$\n\nHence you have everything you need to compute the posterior distribution. \nObviously, if you stick with the Maxium A Posteriori (MAP) estimator, once again you'll have a pointwise estimate, so I suggest you to perform the full integration. Off the top of my head chi-squared distributions does not allow for conjugate priors so you might have to resort to numerical integration (e.g. adaptive quadrature and the likes).\nFinally, the choice of hyper-parameter $\\alpha$ will have an impact on the resulting posterior: you might want to set $\\alpha$ so that the prior distribution is centered around the sample variance for instance?"

But if a recent international report is to be believed, the modern mobster is more into Internet banking and online gambling than numbers rackets and bookmakers.\nThe OECD wants more regulation to control illegal transactions online. Joy Macknight reports The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has called for increased regulatory controls to stem the huge amounts of illegal funds being laundered through a complex web of electronic payment systems. In a report published last month, the OECD's Financial Action Task Force (FATF) targeted online banks and gambling Web sites in an effort to raise awareness about Web-based money laundering. Although cash remains the main form in which illegal funds are held, launderers must move cash proceeds to locations where they can be put into the financial system. The lack of face-to-face contact between client and bank, the ease of access to the Internet and the speed of electronic transactions makes Internet banks a refuge for money launderers, according to the task force. The report says, \"Although [Internet banking] could be considered as contributing positively to the level of efficiency and the reduction of costs of financial services, they also make customer identification and routine monitoring of accounts and transactions by financial institutions more difficult.\" The task force considers online gambling as an ideal Web-based activity to act as a cover for a money laundering scheme through the Internet. Transactions are primarily performed through credit cards. The offshore placement of many Internet gambling sites makes locating and prosecuting the perpetrators extremely difficult. Although the FATF experts were not able to provide examples of money-laundering through online banking and gambling, that does not mean it is not happening by this method. Some cases have been reported in FATF member countries, but many more go undetected because of poor regulation and the means of detection have not been fully developed. Patrick Moulette, secretary general of FATF said, \"Money laundering through online activities has become a important and serious issue. The FATF is fighting to increase legislation and regulation, proposing measures to detect the perpetrators of money laundering.\" All financial institutions in the UK are legally obliged to show they have measures in place to prevent money laundering, such as a system to identify illegal transactions. Transactions over the Internet need to be monitored and assessed to develop profiles of customers. This is becoming impossible to do by traditional methods because there are millions of customers making millions of transactions electronically. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has been developed to track transactions and act automatically to detect suspicious activities and notify a human analyst. Ian Horobin, spokesman for AI developer SearchSpace, said, \"What you're looking at is the next level of service provision. Now, this information can be gathered using advanced AI, which monitors transactions, builds up expectation about every customer and accounts and determines if a transaction breaks the normal pattern.\" The SearchSpace technology uses an anti-money laundering sentinel, which has an adaptive profiling engine allowing it to \"learn\" patterns of transactions. Customers include the Royal Bank of Scotland, the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of New York. How money can be laundered via the Net Mr X sets up a company offering services payable through the Internet Mr X then uses these services and charges for them using credit cards from accounts containing illegal gains located in offshore holdings and held under false names Mr X's firm invoices the credit card company, which forwards the payment for services rendered. Illegal funds become legal. The credit card company, the ISP, the Internet invoicing service and even the bank where the original illegal funds began, would have no reason to believe there was anything suspicious about the activity, since each only sees one part of the transaction.

There are many Treasury activities that have a vital effect on the Government's financial position but with which the Treasurer's office has but slight connection; and there are still other Treasury activities that have no more than remote relationship to the Federal finances but that, for a century, have been regarded as properly allocated to the Treasury and are a part of that establishment. A fair picture of the Treasury should include those branches as well as those that are directly connected with the cash transactions.\nIt is appropriate to state in general terms what those activities are in order that the several major Treasury bureaus may be understood. They are all great and necessary business organizations with distinct Federal duties to perform, and they perform them under the general supervision of the head of the Treasury. Each is subject to the direction of the Under Secretary, acting as the Treasury's general manager. It would be a considerable undertaking adequately to describe any one of them, for each has tasks that are technical, and some of the bureaus referred to necessarily require the services of thousands of employees. Hence no more than a general reference to the scope of the activity of each will be undertaken.\nTHE INTERNAL REVENUE BUREAU\nThe procurement of the funds with which the Treasury operates, obviously, is the first step in the Government's financial procedure. The sources from which almost all the Federal revenue is acquired are such that it naturally falls to the lot of the Treasury to provide the establishments by which the procurement task is to be performed.\nThere are two such establishments, and their titles suggest the services they perform. The first and largest is the Internal Revenue Bureau. It assesses, collects, and deposits about 75 per cent of the Federal revenue. The principal sources as the revenue laws on June 1, 1931, stood are about as follows : income tax 58 per cent, tobacco tax 11 per cent, estate tax 1% per cent, and documentary stamp tax 1% per cent.

June 25, 2009Also published in Culpeper Star-Exponent, Crookston Daily Times, and Alexandria Daily Town Talk\nEver since the Great Depression, it seems, people have lived in mortal fear of losing their jobs. Politicians have therefore come to evaluate every conceivable economic issue with regard to its effect on jobs, and unemployment statistics often dominate press coverage of the economy. Unfortunately, those statistics are easily manipulated to support partisan agendas.\nThe press and politicians alike too often succumb to perverse incentives to play upon public fears by manipulating statistics to portray the situation in its darkest hues.\nWithout doubt, many Americans have lost their jobs as labor-market conditions have deteriorated during the current recession.\nThe most recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts the unemployment rate for May 2009 at 9.4 percent, greater than any reported rate since the recession of the early 1980s. Before the current recession, the unemployment rate had fallen to a cyclical low of 4.4 percent. Since it last touched that low point, in March 2007, it has increased by 114 percent. Describing the situation in this way makes the economic bust appear to be very bad.\nSome observers have also called attention to a broader concept of \"unemployment,\" produced by adding part-time workers who say they would prefer to work full-time and \"discouraged workers,\" who are no longer looking for a job because they believe they can't find one.\nBy my calculation, this bulked-up, unofficial measure of unemployment stood at 15.6 percent of the civilian labor force in May 2009.\nIt is tempting to think of employment and unemployment as mirror images of the same phenomenon, but that idea is misleading. The official unemployment rate, by definition, measures the number of civilians without jobs and actively seeking employment as a percentage of the number of civilians who are either currently employed or actively seeking employment (that is, all those in the civilian labor force).\nTherefore, the ebb and flow of the labor force acts as a sort of buffer between official employment and official unemployment.\nCareful labor economists routinely monitor all of these variables, including the number of involuntarily part-time workers and the number of discouraged workers.\nTo some extent, these complications can be circumvented by paying attention not to unemployment rates, but to employment numbers during the ups and downs of the economy's aggregate fluctuations.\nFor example, the number of civilians employed reached its most recent peak in November 2007, when 146.67 million persons were reported as employed.\nBy May 2009, the number of employed persons had fallen by 4.2 percent to 140.57 million.\nDepending on how deep you wish to make the recession appear, you may say that the rate of civilian unemployment last month had risen 114 percent from its previous cyclical trough, or you may say that the number of civilians employed last month stood at 95.8 percent of its previous cyclical peak.\nThat the public, the media, and the politicians tend to focus more on the former sort of statement tells us something about the public's fears, the media's desire to gain the attention of readers and viewers by frightening them, and the politicians' desire to validate a crisis in order to justify expensive \"stimulus packages\" and other measures of pseudo-salvation.\nRobert Higgs is a Senior Fellow in Political Economy at the Independent Institute and Editor at Large of the Institute's quarterly journal The Independent Review. He received his Ph.D. in economics from Johns Hopkins University, and he has taught at the University of Washington, Lafayette College, Seattle University, the University of Economics, Prague, and George Mason University.\nNew from Robert Higgs!\nThe size and scope of government power has grown in response to crises of war and economic upheavals. Such increased power remains long after each crisis passes, threatening both civil and economic liberties, all at the behest of special interest groups."

He focuses his practice in the areas of valuation, litigation advisory services, complex damages analysis and modeling, mergers and acquisitions, and strategic planning.\nWe are all familiar with the phrase \"cash is king.\" Why is it, though, that cash is crowned king and not real estate, bonds or LeBron James?It all boils down to the fact that everyone can agree to the value of a dollar bill without dispute  -  $1 is worth $1. Someone cannot reasonably argue that a dollar bill is really worth $1.10 or 90 cents.As a result, investors typically prefer to receive cash when selling an ownership interest in a business. It is not uncommon, however, for an acquirer to pay part of the purchase price of an acquisition with its own stock.In the case of a privately held acquirer, the value of its stock is somewhat subjective and there can be reasonable arguments for what one person perceives as being valued at $1 per share being worth 70 cents or $1.40. You get the idea. As a result, it is imperative that both the acquirer and the target in a transaction have support for, and a level of comfort with, the value assigned to the acquirer's shares if they are issued as part of the deal.There is risk on both sides of a transaction when a privately held company is issuing shares as a component of deal consideration. The buyer has an incentive to overvalue its stock and issue fewer shares to the seller, which results in the seller not receiving sufficient compensation for its company. The seller, on the other hand, has an incentive to undervalue the acquirer's stock in an effort to receive more shares and greater ownership percentage, which results in the buyer overpaying. As you can see, there are competing interests that can heighten the incentives for, and the likelihood of, overpayment or underpayment.Another factor that must be considered is that shares in a privately held company are typically subject to a meaningful lack of marketability discount, which may be greater than 30% of the acquiring company's undiscounted value. This discount takes into account the fact that a minority owner in a privately held company cannot readily turn his or her ownership interest into cash (unlike an investment in a publicly traded company). If this discount is not considered when assigning value to the acquirer's shares, it can result in the seller receiving less value than he or she would have had all of the proceeds been paid in cash.The impact of discounts for lack of marketability can extend to shares of publicly traded companies issued in connection with acquisitions as well. We have seen instances in which the sellers in a transaction received restricted stock of the publicly traded acquirer. The restrictions did not permit the sale of the shares for periods ranging from a few months to a few years, which makes the shares less valuable than they would be if they were freely tradable from day one. Imagine receiving shares of a publicly traded company worth $5 million on the date of issuance and watching them decline to $1 million prior to the restricted sale period elapsing. As a result, it is appropriate to consider a discount for lack of marketability for restricted shares in publicly traded companies, as well, to capture the risk associated with potential changes in the price of the acquiring company's shares before the restricted sale period has ended.While acquirers go to great lengths to reduce their risks when purchasing a company, it is still very much a \"buyer beware\" world  -  hence the amount of time spent on due diligence before a transaction closes. When shares of the acquiring company are being issued as a portion of the deal consideration in an acquisition, however, the seller also must beware. In these cases, it is essential that both the buyer and seller accurately value the acquirer's shares, or one party may be left with something worth far less than what it thought it bargained for."

Box 930 Everett, WA 98206 Government cuts drag down U.S. economy\nSHARE: News AnalysisBy Neil IrwinThe Washington Post Published: Saturday, April 27, 2013, 12:01 a.m. << Prev\nRichard Drew / Associated Press\nTraders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.\nWASHINGTON -- We're still stuck in the muck.That's the conclusion to draw from the new report on gross domestic product. The U.S. economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, which was an improvement from the weak 0.4 percent of the final months of 2012. But Friday's report was nearly a percentage point below analysts' expectations, and for the last six months, number averages to only a 1.45 percent annual rate of growth.The report should scratch any thought that our economy is heading into \"escape velocity\" and breaking into a higher, self-reinforcing trajectory of growth. That had appeared to be the case in the first couple of months of the year. But it just isn't so. We're muddling along at basically the same pace we've been at for nearly four straight years of this dismal recovery, with growth too slow to make up the lost economic ground from the 2008-2009 recession.The report details this stuck-in-neutral economy. It's not without bright spots, but there aren't enough of them, and they aren't bright enough to make up for the forces dragging the recovery, most significantly a drop in government spending.The biggest culprit in the weak report was the government sector, which fell at a 4.1 percent rate, after a 7 percent pace of decline in the fourth quarter. The fall was universal -- at the federal, state and local levels. The U.S. government is in pullback mode, and whatever one thinks about reducing the size government in the long run, for now it is unequivocally the villain in slowing growth. If there'd been no change in government spending over the last six months, GDP growth would have averaged a respectable 2.55 percent, not the current soft 1.45 percent.There's also little sign that the private sector is expanding aggressively to make up the difference. Business investment in structures (think factories and office building) fell in the first quarter, while spending on equipment and software rose at a 3 percent annual rate, far below the double-digit pace that was common earlier in the recovery.The best news in from the report is that Americans spent more these first three months of the year. Personal spending rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate, the strongest since the end of 2010, with particularly good showings in durable goods (such as cars and furniture) and services (everything from restaurant meals to health care). That spending could go down in future quarters, as Americans see their paychecks shrink under the higher payroll taxes. But for now, consumers aren't the problem.Housing, on the other hand, which many have hoped will be the big driver of growth in 2013, is expanding, but not fast enough. Residential investment rose at a 12.6 percent rate in the first quarter, but that is coming off a very low starting point, and is slower than the 17.6 percent growth rate of the fourth. This housing \"boom\" added only 0.3 percentage points to the overall rate of GDP growth. The improvement is welcome, but builders need to work more than they did in the first quarter of 2013.Many see these first months of 2013 as a face-off between a government that's retrenching and a housing sector that's expanding. In the first quarter, government unequivocally took dominance, subtracting 0.8 percentage points from growth, as housing added only a 0.3 percentage point.So, there you have it. Economics writers are always looking for signs of change, and we excitedly (sometimes too eagerly) leap to identify a new trend in the economy. But this time there isn't one. Government is contracting, as it has in 10 of the last 11 quarters. The private sector is improving quickly enough to counteract that contraction and ensure that GDP growth is expanding - but not fast enough to spur the robust recovery that the country sorely needs.Neil Irwin writes the Econ Agenda column for The Washington Post and is the economics editor of Wonkblog, The Post's site for policy news and analysis.\nStory tags \" \u2022 Federal"

According to RBR's Worldwide Payment Cards study, the number of cards in circulation will increase by 33 percent to a total of more than 10 billion in the coming three years. By 2014, the value of transactions paid for by card will reach 12.2 trillion U.S. dollars. This also has an impact on consumer behavior. Americans are the top cardholders in the world: The above-mentioned study shows that, on average, they possess more than six cards per person, while Europeans - with 41 transactions per year - top the global ranking when it comes to the number of card payments.\nRetailers and retail banks have realized that their competitiveness depends to a large extent on the cost-efficient and highly available processing of these transactions. More and more new transaction types, channels and technologies must be processed nowadays. While transactions via the Internet or mobile devices have already become standard, tomorrow's technologies will allow payments via cards integrated in mobile phones - or simply by fingerprint.\nIn reality, however, the flexible integration of these new transaction channels and media is hindered by out-dated platforms. What is needed are solutions that enable new services to be brought to the market more dynamically and flexibly while also offering maximum availabilty and protection against hacking, phishing and abuse of card data.\nAdditional challenges arise from the growing number of cross-border transactions. To make such transactions possible, processes and legal requirements must be harmonized and standardized on an international level. For this purpose, organizations such as SEPA and EPASOrg have dedicated themselves to drive international standardization.\nWincor Nixdorf's Cashless Payment Solutions support retail banks and retailers by processing transactions received via banking systems, POS systems, the Internet or other channels using a standardized solution approach. The software takes care of processes such as transaction capturing, identification, authorization and forwarding of data to the target systems.\nWincor Nixdorf has developed a net-centric, end-to-end solution approach that is linearly scalable both in terms of the number of transactions that are processed and in terms of new business functions and channels. Thanks to the integration of a fraud prevention engine to protect the end devices and servers, the dangers of abuse are reduced significantly for all types of transactions.\nWincor Nixdorf's Cashless Payment Solutions do not only comply with all international standards, but do also allow for the flexible integration of new transaction channels and functions.

        "webpage": "France's leaders remain unprepared for economic calamity - Taipei Times\nFrance's leaders remain unprepared for economic calamity\nBy Brigitte Granville Moody's announcement last month that it had downgraded France's sovereign-credit rating by one notch from its \"AAA\" rating prompted one blogger to poke fun at rating agencies' tendency either to get things completely wrong or to recognize suddenly a crisis that had long been staring them in the face. The blogger joked: \"If this recognition by a rating agency that France has problems is an example of the first failing, a recovery must have begun; if it is an example of the second failing, the country faces a dire reckoning.\"French President Francois Hollande's government claims to have awoken to the threat. In a recent interview, French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici likened the measures being undertaken to reduce the country's debt burden and restore competitiveness to a \"Copernican revolution ... because these choices were not clear for a French government or for a center-left government.\"As proof of this new realism, the government has been trumpeting its response to the set of policy recommendations that a panel led by the business executive Louis Gallois presented two weeks before the downgrade. The response is centered on a payroll-tax cut, which will be offset by spending cuts and a higher value-added tax.Before the downgrade, Moody's said that the decision would be based on whether the government heeded the Gallois report's call for a \"competitiveness shock\" to France's economy. The downgrade thus suggests that Moody's considered the government's response insufficient.In fact, this negative verdict barely scratches the surface of France's predicament.The underlying explanation lies in the culture and prejudices of France's governing elite, the so-called grands commis formed by the National Civil Service School of which Hollande is an alumnus. In this world, a just society requires a state-directed economy.\nThis dedication to dirigisme has spawned among the ruling elite a sense of entitlement and hostility to business.Criticism of this anti-business approach is usually dismissed in France as \"ultra-liberal\" flailing against the \"social model\" that the French nation has embraced. However, the example set by Scandinavian countries, which combine a generous welfare state with pro-business policies and traditions, repudiates such claims.The main difference between the failing French model and the more successful Scandinavian approach lies not in welfare \"outputs\"  -  many public services in France, such as the healthcare system, remain among the best in the world  -  but in how they are financed. The Scandinavian social compact rests on the understanding that citizens must pay high taxes in exchange for public services.While French public spending  -  which stood at 56 percent of GDP last year  -  is at or above Scandinavian levels, French households pay lower tax rates on consumption and personal income. The gap is bridged by a mixture of deficit spending and high taxation on employment.Relentless government borrowing and high payroll taxes (employer-paid social security) have long sustained citizens' illusion that they are getting something for nothing, while perpetuating successive governments' misconception that taxing business is a painless way of financing welfare and public services. However, it is increasingly apparent that this approach has undermined public finances and competitiveness  -  and that households end up picking up the tab. Now, citizens are facing higher taxes and cuts to public services."

        "webpage": "Venture Capital Firms Need Access to Government Coffers\nSuch Funding in the Past Has Had a Profound Impact on Job Creation and the Economy\nJ. Leslie Glick, Ph.D.\nThe payoff from venture capital investments in the U.S. is enormous, according to the National Venture Capital Association.\nCongress and the executive branch are working feverishly to resolve the biggest financial crisis since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Unfortunately, as Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson commented in the November 17, 2008, edition of The New York Times, \"There is no playbook for responding to turmoil we have never faced.\" Enormous effort is being devoted to devising game plans for buttressing financial institutions, protecting home mortgagors, salvaging the auto industry, grappling with unemployment, and responding to whatever emerges as the next big issue. Probably over a trillion dollars will be spent in solving or trying to solve this crisis, although a good portion of these funds may be repaid to the government upon the return to normal times.I would propose another approach - utilizing government funds, which might stimulate the economy, create jobs, tackle major technological issues such as fostering the development of alternative sources of energy, and provide the government with a decent return on investment. Perhaps the government should consider partnering with other investors in providing the funds needed by venture capital (VC) firms. According to the National Science Board, in its report entitled \"Science and Engineering Indicators 2008\", before the recent financial meltdown around $50 billion per year of private capital was invested in emerging U.S. companies - approximately half of these funds came from VC firms and the remaining half from angel investors. Clearly, the present environment is not encouraging for the placement of such investment capital.Historical results reported by the National Venture Capital Association for the 20-year period ending December 31, 2007, show an annualized return of 16.7% to investors in some 1,860 U.S. venture capital and private equity partnerships. If the U.S. government had made annual investments of $10 billion in VC firms throughout the U.S. during that 20-year period, the $200 billion total investment would have yielded a total return of almost $1.5 trillion.The impact of venture capital on job creation and the economy is also compelling. According to the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, from 1970 to 2000, U.S. VC firms invested over $270 billion in more than 16,000 companies. In 2000, the surviving VC-backed companies employed 7.6 million people, representing 5.9% of all U.S. jobs, and generated sales of $1.3 trillion, accounting for 13.1% of the U.S. GDP. It is abundantly clear that over the past 30 years VC has played a pivotal role in enabling the commercial development of innovative technologies. VC-funded advances in information technology and biotechnology have transformed our way of life. Increases in VC funding will spur the development and commercialization of alternative sources of energy. VC-funded companies will also develop and commercialize technologies that will address other important societal concerns, such as the need to reduce the costs of healthcare delivery and the need to improve teaching and learning effectiveness.In the midst of this crisis, the federal government has a unique opportunity to play a novel role in both stimulating the economy and solving huge societal problems, while paving the way for an unprecedented return on investment. The key to implementation is to establish an apolitical mechanism, perhaps overseen by a panel of independent business people, by which government funds, perhaps amounting to $10 to 25 billion annually, could be transferred directly to VC firms throughout the nation. The panel would be responsible for vetting VC firms and investing government monies in the funds of the approved VC firms. All investment decisions regarding which companies the VC firms should fund would be left exclusively to the general partners in the venture capital firms. The government would simply be a limited partner along with the other limited partners in these firms.In essence, this proposal turns government aid into an investment vehicle, governed by the rules of a free market economy. Money flows from government to VC firms to deserving companies (as determined by the VC firms), which develop and commercialize technologies to meet the needs of the marketplace. Needless to say, as historical data show, most such companies will not be winners, but enough will, thereby accomplishing societal objectives while providing the government with more than an adequate return to offset losses of those companies not among the winners.\nJ.

Economic Democracy and America's Future.\" (The event was supposed to take place this Wednesday evening; due to potentially hazardous travel conditions, organizers decided Tuesday afternoon to reschedule Wolff's visit for late April. Stay tuned.)At speaking events throughout the country, the Harvard-, Stanford-, and Yale-educated economist argues that capitalism, while it may be all we know, is worth examining, criticizing, and ultimately overthrowing. The Phoenix spoke with Wolff about his philosophy and what he sees as viable alternatives to our broken system. What follows is an edited version of our conversation.What, in your mind, is the most glaring evidence that our current economic system is not working? I think the one I would pick is the growing inequality of wealth and income and the growing inequality of political power and cultural access that come from that. In other words, as the one percent becomes insanely  -  or obscenely  -  wealthy...the rest of the people disappear. I literally see students in my office with tears coming down their faces, as they explain that they can't take out another 5-10 thousand dollars, they can't turn to their parents, their parents feel bad about it. The absurdity of this... The future of the United States depends on the workers you produce. To make it harder and harder to go to college and university, this is shooting yourself in the foot. These are all signs of a society spinning out of control. And we live in a society that cultivates a blindness to all this.What role you think US academic institutions have played in our understanding, or lack thereof, of the economic crisis; what role do you think they could play moving forward? There was a time, and I hope it comes again, when academics had the courage and independence to be a leading force in facing up to difficult realities, if not mobilizing people to deal with them. We're not there right now. Particularly in my field of economics, the complicity of our profession with the status quo is overwhelming and very debilitating. The response of my discipline has been to retreat into an ever-more technical economics, focusing on details, minutia, basically looking the other way as a system unravels because there aren't rewards for being the truthteller, for being the critic. You get more rewards for playing by the rules. I find that very tragic. There are of course exceptions  -  there are professors, there are students, there are even whole departments that are willing to face the problems our country faces. But we live in a country that has specialized in demonizing critics of our economic system."

By Sonya StinsonPublished June 13, 2013Bankrate.com\nAt times, the rancorous debate over what to do about the looming Social Security funding gap seems like an argument among doctors about how to save a dying patient. One side insists that major surgery (cutting benefits) is the only solution; the other is certain any invasive treatment will only make matters worse.But some observers say the Social Security system is far from death's door. And they say the cure for its funding woes would be fairly simple if politics weren't standing in the way.Former Social Security trustee Marilyn Moon says the system requires only \"very small changes\" to get back in balance.\"Most of the people that I know who analyze Social Security, including me, believe that this is a relatively easy problem to fix in terms of finding a fair and reasonable solution,\" says Moon, who is now senior vice president and director of the health program at the American Institutes for Research in Washington, D.C. \"But we also believe that it is politically a difficult one to fix.\"Insolvency vs. bankruptcyIn their 2012 annual report, the Social Security trustees predict that assets in the federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds will begin to decline in 2021 and become exhausted by 2033.But Maya Rockeymoore, president and CEO of Global Policy Solutions, a Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm, says there is an important distinction between insolvency, which is what the Social Security trust fund is facing, and bankruptcy, which is what many people fear when they watch and read the news. If no action is taken, incoming Social Security taxes would cover about 75 percent of scheduled benefits -- a deficit Rockeymoore acknowledges is cause for concern.\"It is a challenge, but not a crisis,\" says Rockeymoore, who co-chaired the Commission to Modernize Social Security. \"There are policy solutions that can be adopted to address this issue. Yet, we continue to see people argue that the Social Security sky is falling, when that is not correct.\""

We believe these bills encourage the participation of all, while providing the tools to defend against cyber threats by funding research and development activities,\" the letter said.\nNAFCU, however, did not sign the letter. Vice President of Legislative Affairs Brad Thaler said NAFCU's exclusion from the letter does not mean the trade's position differs from others in the industry; but rather that NAFCU wanted to emphasize the importance of legislation that also addresses data security.\nNAFCU's letter, penned by Thaler, noted that while credit unions have been subjected to data security standards since the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, retailers are not. As a result, Thaler said, credit unions are often forced to charge off fraud-related losses, many of which stem from a negligent entity's failure to protect sensitive information.\nHe urged House leaders to hold any entity that stores financial or personal data to minimum standards of protection.\nNAFCU further recommended in the letter that the House consider additional data security issues as it tackles the broad topic of cyber security, including holding retailers and others financial liable for the cost of breaches and requiring merchants to display consumer disclosures regarding data security risk.\nThe bills will now advance to the Senate. One of the bills, The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, will likely be vetoed by President Obama due to privacy issues. That bill, H.R. 756, is similar to 2012's Cyberintelligence Sharing and Protection Act, which also passed the House but did not advance in the Senate, due to Obama's veto threat.\nThe other two bills are H.R. 967, The Advancing America's Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Act, which concerns the National High-Performance Computing Program, and H.R. 1163, The Federal Information Security Amendments Act, which would require federal agencies to comply with National Institute of Standards and Technology computer standards."

The Atlantic Email\nOne needs only to browse the headlines, or perhaps observe the bustling action at your neighborhood thrift store, to realize that America's middle classes have been faring poorly lately. Here, a few recent headlines that collectively sum up the state of the middle class:\n\"Many in the U.S. slip from the middle class, study finds\"\nAccording to a new report from Pew Charitable Trusts (covered by the Washington Post, among others), the phenomena of \"downward mobility\" was common even before the economy collapsed in 2007. Among Americans who grew up as members of the middle class, 21% of white men and a whopping 39% of African American men qualified as downwardly mobile - falling below the 30th percentile in income, or earning 20% less than their parents - before the recession presumably put them in an even worse financial state.\n\"The Limping Middle Class\"\nThis New York Times op-ed from Robert B. Reich points out that the richest 5% of Americans now account for 37% of consumer purchases - and nowadays especially, the middle classes just don't have enough purchasing power to keep the economy humming along. Not without heading deeply back into debt, that is. But there are reasons that a wealthier, more stable, more empowered middle class benefits Americans in all income brackets:\nThe economy cannot possibly get out of its current doldrums without a strategy to revive the purchasing power of America's vast middle class. The spending of the richest 5 percent alone will not lead to a virtuous cycle of more jobs and higher living standards.\n(MORE: Has America Become a Nation of Squatters?)\n\"Middle class may be losing political influence\" An Arizona Republic story voices a nagging sentiment felt by many: Namely, that \"Congress no longer is in touch with middle-class concerns and anxieties the way it once was.\" Among those who subscribe to this point of view happens to be a member of Congress, Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.):\n\"In the past, job bills, unemployment insurance, funding for education, the security of Medicare and Social Security  -  all those things were driven by the middle class and those who aspired to the middle class,\" said Grijalva, one of the most liberal members of Congress and co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \"Now, all those things are jeopardized because the agenda has shifted to those special-interest groups who right now are controlling the purse strings and are making it possible for people to be elected, and influencing those elections.\"\n\"Down and Out in L.A.: When the Middle Class Goes Homeless\" A recent TIME story reports on the rise of families resorting to homeless shelters in the Los Angeles area. The number of families housed in one shelter, for instance, has tripled since 2008.\n(MORE: Just in Time for Labor Day, Some Especially Grim Employment Statistics)\n\"Can the Middle Class Be Saved?\"\nThe answer to this question, posed in an enormous Atlantic Monthly cover story, is a definitive \"um, maybe ... hopefully?\" What's argued here is that the Great Recession has sped up broad societal transformations that have been in progress for generations, and what's emerging quickly is a dramatically tiered society consisting of a tiny group of the ultra-wealthy elite, a larger subset of professional workers in the middle-class - \"unexceptional college graduates for whom the arrow of fortune points mostly sideways\" - and everybody else. This latter group represents the majority of the population, and they're in the most trouble:\nThe true center of American society has always been its nonprofessionals - high-school graduates who didn't go on to get a bachelor's degree make up 58 percent of the adult population. And as manufacturing jobs and semiskilled office positions disappear, much of this vast, nonprofessional middle class is drifting downward.\nBrad Tuttle is a reporter at TIME.

        "webpage": "Who gets the most federal spending for their tax dollars? MGN Online News Share\nWednesday, November 13, 2013 - 7:59am NEW YORK (CNNMoney) --  -  NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Figuring out how much you get for the taxes you pay is a tricky business.\nIn a report this week, the Tax Foundation attempts to answer the question. It compares how different income groups benefit from federal spending -- directly and indirectly -- for every tax dollar they pay.\nThe broad takeaway: The bottom 60% of Americans receive more from government spending than they pay in taxes, and the top 40% get less from government spending than they pay.\nThe issue comes down to a question of how federal spending is allocated to each group. There is no widespread agreement on the right way to do that.\nSpending represents everything from direct federal payments such as those for food stamps, Social Security and farm subsidies to spending on public goods intended to benefit everyone such as national defense, education and highways.\nThose in the bottom 20% of the income scale (who make no more than $17,000 and are at or near poverty level) get back the equivalent of $8.13 in federal spending for every federal tax dollar they pay, according to the report. That's in part because of anti-poverty programs and refundable tax credits.\nBy contrast, those in the top 20% (who make more than $120,000) get back 25 cents for every tax dollar they pay.\nThose in the middle ($37,000 to $67,000) receive $1.57.\nIn coming up with these numbers, the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning tax research group, decided to allocate the benefits of spending on public goods like defense evenly across the population.\nBut it also notes that there are alternative ways to allocate spending.\nOne common scenario assumes that high-income households benefit more from public goods spending than lower income households.\nIn that case, the gap would narrow as the amount of spending per tax dollar would go up for high-income taxpayers, and go down for the lowest- and middle-income groups.\nThe fact that there is a gap at all, however, is not surprising because many spending programs and the tax code are designed to be progressive -- meaning they are meant to redistribute some income from the wealthiest to the poorest.\nSo what's the point of the exercise?\nAfter all, there's no way to objectively assess whether the gaps are too wide, too narrow or just right. Indeed, that's a political decision, and there is ample divide over that question in Washington.\n\"It's a point to start the conversation,\" said Scott Hodge, executive director of the Tax Foundation, which has advocated for lower tax rates and a simpler tax system.\nOf course, that assumes lawmakers are ready to have a meaningful debate and craft substantive policy about taxes and spending -- something they currently are nowhere near.\nNevertheless, the idea of looking holistically at both sides of the federal ledger and trying to paint a more accurate picture of who benefits would be helpful, said Matthew Gardner, executive director of the liberal-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\nBut Gardner would have preferred a different method entirely, one that might drastically alter the results: measuring spending against taxes paid by Americans according to their wealth instead of income.\n\"It's about what you have to lose,\" he said. \"Income is not going to be a great measure of that.\"\nThe-CNN-Wire"

        "webpage": "Four Common Startup Money Mistakes\nStartup businesses come in myriad different forms, but each have one thing in common: They need proper financial management in order to survive. Small-business finance expert Steve Strauss, author of Get Your Business Funded: Creative Methods for Getting the Money You Need, outlines four common money mistakes everyone should avoid:\n1. Underestimating startup costs. Strauss says the most common mistake he sees entrepreneurs make when launching a business is underestimating the amount of money they will need. Startup costs, repaying investors and even the founder's salary are all areas where entrepreneurs are too frugal in their estimates, he says. When the reality of the true cost of running the business hits, many find their budgets stretched--sometimes beyond what is sustainable.\n2. Failing to establish a marketing budget. Social media, e-mail marketing and publicity may be touted as low-cost ways to promote your business, but when business owners think they can launch on a shoestring, they often run into trouble, Strauss says. \"The only way you can turn on the light and let people know you're there is by marketing and advertising, or you're going to have no customers,\" he says. While some say the rule of thumb for establishing a marketing budget is 5 percent of projected annual revenue, Strauss says each business has to tailor its marketing budget to its own needs. A regional business may have more limited marketing venues than a business that is launching nationally or internationally, for example.\n3. Not organizing for tax savings. It's important to seek the counsel of a knowledgeable financial advisor to determine how to organize your business for the best possible tax advantage. \"Some people run their businesses as sole proprietorships instead of LLCs or S corps and give up real savings on taxes. That's a big mistake,\" Strauss says.\n4. Spending too much. When you land that big loan or have some savings accrued for startup, it can be tempting to splurge on a nice office space or a big staff. That's a no-no, Strauss says. Keeping overhead low is one of the easiest ways businesses can better manage their money and ensure their survival, he says. \"This is especially important when you're in the heady first days and you want to go buy new furniture and new computers and big rent. Slow down there, cowboy,\" Strauss says. \"Think about how to better save or invest that money for the long-term growth of your business.\" For early stage companies, angel investment can be an attractive funding option, says James Hunt, angel investor and adjunct professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. Hunt specializes in early stage funding and has holdings in about two dozen companies. Here, he shares the secrets to getting a blessing--and funding--from an angel.\nWhat are the signs that an entrepreneur is suited for this kind of outside investment?\nYou have to be realistic about the investment and about the expectations. Angel investment is typically smaller in size than earlier stage or seed funding. You have to be willing to take direction from investors and be able to show that you have some sort of strategy for returning the investment.\nWhat else is important to you?\nWe ask some hard questions. Have you put any of your own money up? Have you recruited a team? Have they proven they can do this in the past? And is your market substantial enough to support reasonable growth? They don't have to be trillion-dollar markets, but they have to be large enough so the angels can see they're capturing some percent of a vibrant market.\nDo you have deal-breakers?\nYou have to be a coachable CEO. You watch the body language of the entrepreneur when you say, \"One of our angels is going to sit on your board and be very active in your company, actively giving you guidance.\" If the guy squirms at that, that's pretty much the end. We're just not willing to deal with inflexible entrepreneurs who think they know everything. I've been doing this for 35 years and I still don't know everything. So if they're not willing to accept a certain amount of coaching, then we're not very interested.\nWhat's the size of a typical angel deal?\nOur deals are sort of midhundred thousands to low millions. So if you want a deal above that, we won't do it. But other angel groups may do bigger deals. When you start researching angels, you can usually get a sense of the types of deals they prefer and an idea of the size of the deals--which can tell you who will be a good fit for your company.\nImage from shutterstock.com / attila dudas\nMoney Mistakes"

        "webpage": "Need A Retirement Starter Kit? This Might Help By Marilyn Geewax\nJan 29, 2014 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email With new accounts called myRAs, the government would protect workers' savings from losses.\nOriginally published on February 3, 2014 12:56 pm Financial planners all say: The sooner you start saving, the better off you'll be in retirement. But that advice often goes unheeded by young workers focused on paying down student debt and car loans. And even for those who can afford to set aside a little cash, investing can seem complicated and risky. In his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Obama said he's got a way to fix all of that. He calls it myRA  -  a difficult-to-say-aloud name that is supposed to get people thinking about \"my retirement account.\" This new way of saving would be different from a traditional tax-deferred individual retirement account, or IRA. For one thing, workers can't lose money in myRAs; the government would protect the principal and help savings grow a bit faster than inflation. Participating employers could help workers steer portions of their paychecks into the retirement accounts through automatic deductions. But they would face few costs because they would not administer the accounts. The White House says about half of all workers do not have access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans. The myRAs are aimed at those left-out workers. \"I want more people to have the chance to save for retirement through their hard work. And this is just one step that we can take to help more people do that,\" Obama said Wednesday while visiting the U.S. Steel Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, Penn., southeast of Pittsburgh. At the mill, Obama signed an order directing the Treasury Department to create the accounts, which would be portable as workers move from one employer to another. And myRAs would offer a safety level similar to a traditional, government-backed savings bond. The White House said the savings plans would be available to households with incomes below $191,000. The initial investment could be as low as $25, and subsequent savings could be in amounts as small as $5. Savers would not get hit with a tax penalty if they had to withdraw the money for an emergency. The White House said the accounts would offer the same variable interest-rate return as federal employees get when they enroll in the Thrift Savings Plan Government Securities Investment Fund. That fund had an average annual return of 3.61 percent from 2003 through 2012. Once a saver had accumulated $15,000 in an account, the money would have to be rolled over into a private-sector Roth IRA. The money could then by moved into other types of investments that offer higher returns. Monica D'Angelo, 22, a business student at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, said she is looking forward to the myRA rollout later this year. \"Most people I know are pretty overwhelmed by student debt,\" D'Angelo said. It's hard to focus on long-term savings without a push from employers, government and parents, she said. D'Angleo got that push from her mother. So at age 20, she opened an IRA and put aside a little money from a summer job. \"After I graduate in May and start working, I'll want to contribute again,\" she said. Having the option of automatic paycheck deductions for a myRA would be a big plus, she said. \"The way companies have been moving away from offering benefits, I think it helps to have the government step in.\" Dallas Salisbury, president and CEO of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said myRAs may encourage small businesses that have never offered retirement plans to begin to do so. A myRA provides an \"automatic payroll deduction with great ease to the employer,\" and at an investment level low enough that \"the vast majority say they could afford to be saving,\" Salisbury said. But some experts are skeptical, given how low participation rates are for existing IRAs. Greg McBride, a senior analyst with the consumer finance website Bankrate.com, said history suggests many people are reluctant to sign up for any voluntary program that reduces take-home pay. \"If you wait for people to sign up on their own volition and check the box as to how much they're going to contribute, guess what? They don't do it,\" he said. NPR's Yuki Noguchi contributed to this story.Copyright 2014 NPR. To see more, visit . \u00a9 2015 KTEP"

        "webpage": "'Cliff' Deal Would End Payroll Tax Holiday\nShare Tweet E-mail Comments Print By editor Originally published on Tue January 8, 2013 9:19 am\nTranscript AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: In covering this debate, much has been made of income tax rates and where exactly they should be raised. But one fact has gotten far less notice. Starting today, payroll taxes are going up two percentage points for nearly all American workers. NPR's John Ydstie joins us to talk about it. And John, this means lower take-home pay for a lot of workers starting very soon. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: That's right, Audie. If you're not getting a raise this year, your paycheck's not just going to stay the same, it's actually going to be a little smaller in 2013 and that's because for about two years now, the government has been collecting 2 percentage points less from you to fund Social Security. But that tax holiday expired at midnight last night, so in 2013, you once again will be paying 6.2 percent of your salary for the Social Security payroll tax. And that, you know, really adds up to real money. Let's say you make a relatively modest income of about $30,000 a year. Your annual take-home pay will be $600 less as a result of this expiration. Or take a couple and say they each make at least $113,000 a year, that's the top amount subject to Social Security taxes. Their take-home pay would be $4500 less. In fact, on average, workers will get around $960 less in take-home pay because the payroll tax holiday hasn't been extended. CORNISH: But the idea behind the payroll tax holiday was to stimulate the economy. And by that measure, did it work? YDSTIE: Yeah. I think most economists would agree it did. It was enacted in late 2010 when unemployment was very high and it raised take-home pay by around $100 billion a year. The economic research firm, Moody's Analytics, says for every dollar workers were able to keep in their pockets, $1.27 was added to U.S. GDP as the money circulated through the economy. So it undoubtedly played a role in helping support growth in the last two years. Now, it wasn't the best way to stimulate the economy because it put money in the pockets of a lot of well-off people, many of whom saved it, didn't spend it. Ironically, it actually replaced a more stimulative tax break called the Making Work Pay tax cut, which targeted lower income people who would be more likely to spend it, providing more fuel for the economy. But that tax cut was initiated by President Obama and Republicans wouldn't renew it back in 2010, but they did go along with this payroll tax break. CORNISH: So help us understand, if most economists agree the payroll tax holiday has actually helped the economy, isn't allowing it to expire going to hurt the economy when the government starts taking this money out of people's pockets again? YDSTIE: You're right. It very likely will hurt the economy. Economists say it could trim more than a half a percentage point off of growth in 2013. And when you're only growing in the range of around 2 percent or a little more than that a year, that's significant. CORNISH: John, unemployment is still over 7.5 percent, why pull the plug on the payroll tax holiday now? YDSTIE: Well, President Obama did propose extending it in his first offer during negotiations with House Speaker Boehner a couple weeks ago. But it came off the table relatively quickly. One reason is that it's adding to the deficit, which makes Republicans nervous. Also, some Democrats think the payroll tax holiday could undermine the Social Security system. Up to now, the government has been transferring money from its big general fund to the Social Security trust fund to make up for the money being lost to the tax break. But these Democrats fear that could end some day and weaken the program. CORNISH: That's NPR's John Ydstie. John, thank you. YDSTIE: You're welcome, Audie. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR."

        "webpage": "Economy improving; caution still prudent By: Angie DeRosa\nLast month, heads of nations convened in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum. The media overwhelmingly reported a sense of calm in the mountain resort town and in markets in general.The world economy, it seems, has experienced the worst, but is fragile and gingerly making a comeback. For this year, the eurozone is expected to see a decline in gross domestic product, while emerging markets will see 5 percent growth and China will see better than 8 percent growth.But risks of relapse and complacency lead Christine LaGarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to encourage the \"do not relax\" principle. \"Tools that are in the toolbox have to be operational,\" she remarked during a panel discussion on the ways in which nations have to steer monetary and fiscal policies.For example, the United States has seen growth pick up and it is continuing to move at a reasonable pace. In the third quarter of 2012, U.S. GDP expanded 3.1 percent compared with the second quarter's 1.3 percent. But, as evidenced by GDP contracting 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter  -  the first time in three years  -  the United States has to be savvy with medium-term decisions on its debt trajectory, for example, to guide it through its fragile state.Emerging markets will have to rebalance their business models to gear for more domestic consumption and less reliance on exports.A more aggressive approach has been taken by Japan, where officials issued a statement Jan. 22 on overcoming deflation and achieving sustainable economic growth. Its three-prong approach includes bold monetary and flexible fiscal policies with an eye on revitalized economic growth. Those revitalization efforts include concentrating resources on R&D, strengthening the country's foundation for innovation, carrying out bold regulatory and institutional reforms and making better use of the tax system.If you weren't able to catch any of the coverage from the WEF, it's worth trying to do some catch-up.

Unlike 1997, they are not overburdened with debt, and most have avoided significant layoffs, leaving them in a strong position to expand production as soon as demand returns.\nBut perhaps the most striking trend has been how businesses have streamlined their financial management to cut costs. Producers are taking an in-depth look at their supply chains - not just their tier 1 suppliers, but deep into the second, third and fourth tiers - in a drive to control costs and understand potential vulnerabilities.\nThe preference for connectivity has been amplified by cash-rich Asian businesses looking for competitively priced acquisitions in Europe and the US.\nWe have seen subtle and interesting shifts in acquisition profiles. Asian businesses are still interested in buying Western companies to establish a hold in developed markets and to use their technical advantage to move up the value chain, but they are now also looking for management skills that will assist them to take their business to the next level.\nIf Asian businesses spent 2012 looking inward to cut costs by pursuing greater integration and efficiency, they were also looking outward for new growth opportunities, particularly in other emerging markets - the so-called South-South trade routes.\nChina is leading the charge - overseas direct investment surged more than 25 per cent in the first 10 months of the year to reach USD58 billion. The flow of raw materials from the Middle East, Africa and Latin America to Asia is well-established, but Asian exporters are forging new trade links to provide infrastructure, goods and services to other emerging economies to take advantage of growing disposable incomes.\nThis is part of a long-term shift in the shape of global growth. Our research indicates that 17 of the world's 30 largest economies in 2050 will be what we now regard as emerging markets, and the International Monetary Fund predicts that more than 60 per cent of global GDP growth in the next five years will come from outside the developed world.\nThe continuing uncertainties in Europe and the US have weighed on Asian markets over the past year, but despite these difficulties and the slowdown in China, we are seeing a shift in sentiment, with the green shoots of cautious optimism beginning to emerge. Most importantly, from an Asian perspective, China seems to be back on the road to growth.\nThis year will present its own challenges.

        "webpage": "PILOT Task Force Releases Recommendations\nMembers suggest new ways to calculate payments in lieu of taxes\nReleased By:\nMayor's Office For More Information Contact:\nMayor's Press Office\n\nRecommendations were released today in a final report issued by the nine members of Mayor Menino's Payment In Lieu Of Taxes (PILOT) Task Force which has been reviewing PILOTs since January 2009. The recommendations propose a standard level of contributions for all major tax-exempt property owners and set forth a methodology for valuing community partnerships.\nTask Force members voted unanimously to accept the following PILOT program recommendations:\nPILOT program should remain voluntary. Task Force members hope the \"spirit of partnership\" continues to be a motivating force with payments in lieu of taxes. Members did not recommend changes to state law to establish legal or statutory requirements for non-profits. PILOT program should be applied to all nonprofit groups. Task Force believed that all nonprofits should participate in the program. However, the Task Force determined that an exception should be made for smaller nonprofits that might lack the resources to fully engage in the PILOT process. Task Force members suggested a total property value threshold of $15 million for program participation. PILOT contributions should be based on the value of real estate owned by an institution. Payments should reflect the size and quality of the institution's real estate holdings and be consistent with the approach taken for taxable properties. The Task Force believed that PILOTs should be calculated as 25% of what the nonprofit's property would yield if taxable. It is suggested that each nonprofit receive an exemption of $15 million in property value. Give credit for community benefits offered by the institution. The Task Force recommended that a credit for Community Benefits should be limited to 50% of full PILOT payment. Examples of community benefits include public/community health initiatives, targeted scholarships for Boston Public School students, and summer jobs. Give credit for property taxes paid on certain properties. Institutions would receive a credit on their PILOT in the amount of real estate taxes paid on properties that would ordinarily qualify for a tax exemption based on use.\nAllow institutions and the City of Boston time to make adjustments that are in keeping with the new PILOT calculation formula. The Task Force suggests that a gradual approach will allow for a smooth transition to the new program and that the new formula should be phased in over a period not less than five years. \"My goal in establishing this task force has been to update the [PILOT] program so that it is fair and consistent,\" said Mayor Menino. \"The Task Force's Final Report & Recommendations is comprehensive and will serve as a foundation for the City's payment in lieu of tax program as we move forward.\"\n\"The Task Force has concluded that the core principles of a fair and balanced PILOT Program are transparency and consistency,\" said PILOT Task Force Chairman Stephen Kidder, an attorney at Hemenway & Barnes LLP and former Commissioner of Revenue for the Commonwealth. \"This Final Report is the product of numerous public meetings held by the Task Force since our appointment by Mayor Menino in January 2009. Many individuals and organizations participated in the review process and provided the Task Force with helpful and important information which contributed to these recommendations.\"\nMayor Menino will review the recommendations to determine the next steps in implementing the revised PILOT guidelines. Members of the Mayor's PILOT Task Force included: Stephen Kidder, Attorney, Hemenway & Barnes LLP\nDr. Robert Brown, President, Boston University\nDr. Zorica Pantic, President, Wentworth Institute of Technology Patricia McGovern, General Counsel & Senior VP for Corporate and Community Affairs, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Dr. Thomas Glynn, Chief Operating Officer, Partners HealthCare, Inc.\nGail Latimore, Director, Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation\nJames D.

        "webpage": "From the November 21, 2012 issue of Credit Union Times Magazine \u2022 Subscribe! Call Center Software Provides CU of America With Smooth Sailing\nNovember 21, 2012 \u2022 Reprints Any major operational change at a credit union, such as a move, merger or core system conversion, can cause an influx of member service requests and potentially a call center nightmare.\nBut the $499 million Credit Union of America in Wichita, Kan., said it soared through a merger and headquarters location move without a hitch and credits its call center software, the Customer Interaction Center from Indianapolis, Ind.-based Interactive Intelligence Group Inc., which it first implemented in 2004.\nEarlier this year, the now 16-branch Credit Union of America merged with the competing First Choice Credit Union and built a new location in Wichita to house its headquarters. Richard Logan, senior vice president and chief information officer for Credit Union of America, said growth at the credit union, in addition to plans for a core banking system conversion, prompted the headquarters move.\nThe credit union will move to an in-house system in December and at that point, will require more space for a data center, Logan said.\nCIC, an all-in-one contact center platform that facilitates interactions on multiple channels, is in use at approximately 120 credit unions, according to Interactive Intelligence. Through Credit Union of America's merger, former First Choice staffers were moved onto CIC's automatic call distributor platform, which allowed them to continue serving members whose accounts they were most familiar with, Logan said.\nDuring the credit union's headquarters move, half of its call center staff moved first and were followed by the other half a week later; the credit union reports it did not experience a rise in member complaints throughout the process.\nSome of the attributes of CIC that won Credit Union of America over back in 2004 have been especially beneficial to the cooperative through its recent changes, according to Logan. These include the fact that CIC is software-based and it compiles each user's emails, instant message conversations and incoming calls in the order they're received in a single queue. It also displays the availability status of each user, which helps employees avoid transferring members to employees who are out of the office.\n\"CIC enables our employees to initiate calls directly from their email or contact lists,\" Logan said. \"And, they can make conference calls by simply dragging names into the desktop client's call control window.\"\nInternal communication has dramatically improved through CIC's presence management feature by enabling the credit union's staff to see the status of colleagues, Logan said. Service has improved as well since employees can now avoid transferring customer calls to unavailable colleagues.\nCIC's Web-based nature allows users to access the platform regardless of their location, according to Logan. Each staff member's extension number is linked to his or her network login, so they can receive calls at the same number even when they're not at their desks. This is particularly helpful for employees who often travel between branches, he noted.\n\"Using CIC, our employees simply log in from wherever they are and it's just like working from headquarters; they get all the same call control and presence management functionality, and their location is completely transparent to callers,\" Logan said. \"As a credit union with multiple branch offices, this has had a huge impact on productivity and customer service.\"\nAnother benefit CIC brings to Credit Union of America is a savings on long distance phone calls. The credit union has configured the system so each time an employee makes a long distance call, it travels across the WAN, through the credit union's local office, which allows it to essentially be placed as a local call, Logan explained.\nCIC also lets the credit union add new extensions, eliminating the need to purchase new phone lines. Logan said the long distance call avoidance feature is especially helpful because the credit union's branches are scattered across different area code zones in Kansas.\nBrad Herrington, solutions marketing manager for Interactive Intelligence, added that CIC automatically pulls up member information onto employees' screens when the member contacts the credit union, saving employees from having to manually search for the information. CIC also provides space for future growth. Credit unions and other Interactive Intelligence customers can add up to 5,000 users to the platform.\nAdditionally, the platform provides support in situations where a credit union needs to temporarily beef up its support staff during a hectic event such as a merger. They can add users from a third party service support company or assign platform usage rights to staffers who don't normally handle service calls, Herrington said.\n\"It provides you with the flexibility to move the system where you want to, whether you're going through a merger or core conversion,\" Herrington said. \"You just have to move the people. You're able to provide multiple types of service from one platform. It's an all-in-one system that provides everything you need to communicate.\"\nLogan concluded that as the credit union continues to grow and evolve, CIC helps maintain an essential piece of member service including responding to member calls, emails and instant messages without missing a beat.\n\"By not having to put members on hold, we can serve them better. It gives us the flexibility to do business the way we want to do business.\" Show Comments"

        "webpage": "Down from Liberalism\nT.M. Scanlon\nA Conflict of Visions\nMorrow, 273 pp., $15.95\nThomas Sowell is an economist who has attracted much attention for his conservative views. Sowell writes a widely syndicated newspaper column, in which one finds a steady stream of spirited attacks on liberal ideas and policies. For example, Sowell attacks businessmen who oppose apartheid by divesting themselves and their companies of holdings in South Africa; the effect, he writes in his column, is to deprive the blacks there of both jobs and training. In the US, state-sponsored programs of \"slum clearance,\" he thinks, reduce the options of the poor who live in slums by forcing them to spend more for housing and less on food, clothing, and other goods.\nOne might regard these attacks as a series of unrelated disputes about the probable consequences of various policies. Sowell, however, sees a larger pattern. Liberals, he says, characteristically believe that there are solutions to all social problems. They are quick to intervene in pursuit of the outcomes demanded by their conception of social justice, while ignoring the larger processes that are at work. As a result, they wind up hurting the very people whom they wish to help. In A Conflict of Visions this theme is developed into a general criticism of liberal thinking in political philosophy, legal theory, and social policy. This criticism is presented in the form of an analysis of the fundamental difference between the political positions that people take.\nSowell observes that people who agree on one issue frequently agree on others as well. The same people are often found on the same sides of controversies over such diverse questions as military spending, drug laws, monetary policy, and international aid. A Conflict of Visions tries to explain how these alignments come about. One familiar explanation appeals to differences in the breadth of sympathetic concern: some people are strongly moved by the fate of people different from themselves, such as the poor, drug addicts, and victims of famine, while others are strongly concerned only with members of a narrower group with whom they identify. A second common explanation sees the difference as moral: a disagreement over what rights people have, what obligations citizens, individually and collectively, have to others at home or abroad, and what political institutions must do for their citizens if they are to be accepted as legitimate.\nA basic thesis of A Conflict of Visions is that both of these explanations are mistaken. The fundamental difference separating liberals and conservatives, according to Sowell, is a difference in \"visions,\" that is, in very general views about how the world works, what possibilities are open to us, and how much it is possible for us to know. People who hold different visions also tend to have different moral views, but these moral differences, Sowell contends, are not fundamental. Rather, they are consequences of more basic disagreements about causality and knowledge.\nThe conflict referred to in the title of Sowell's book is between two such visions.

        "webpage": "Transition: The Sacred, The Scared, And The Scarred\nBy Carolyn Baker\nCarolynbaker.net\nI read with great fascination, Rob Hopkins' critical response to Michael Brownlee's November 26 article \"The Evolution of Transition In The U.S.\" In it, Rob begins by listing a number of criticisms of Transition in recent years and adds that criticism of Transition has been a positive process which has helped to shape what it is today. However, he finds Michael's proposal to put the sacred at the center of Transition \"concerning.\"\nDespite my deep respect for Rob and the enormous legacy to which he and Transition in the UK have given birth, I cannot be silent about his concerns. The first seems to be Michael's assertion that Transition initiatives in the U.S. must \"declare independence,\" from Transition in the U.K. Here I recall one of the things that first drew me to Transition, namely its focus on local solutions based on the needs of a particular place. Having been an activist for decades, I was beyond disillusioned by groups that claimed to depart from the hierarchical, corporate functioning of most organizations of industrial civilization but in fact, mimicked them. I was thrilled to discover that the Transition model as outlined in the Transition Handbook, was at long last, a genuine exception to this. In more recent months, however, I have started to feel as if a kind of creeping corporatism is beginning to emerge which as Michael notes, we need to declare independence from. Specifically, what I have noticed is an implicit assumption that however Transition is implemented in a particular place, it must defer to the leadership of Transition in the U.K. and in the U.S. So on the one hand, \"declaring independence\" from a tendency to become monolithic in thinking and action may well be necessary, but in no way is this synonymous with renouncing a \"spirit of collaboration.\" Throughout Michael's article, I hear a deep desire for collaboration, but also for resilience in our approach to implementing Transition in the U.S.\nAs for economics, Rob's argument against putting all his eggs in the basket of any one economic theory, misses the point. The point is not to choose a particular theory and defend it, but to put all the theories he mentioned on the table and engage in deep, protracted dialog about all of them. The U.K. is presently enduring a horrible winter in which people are freezing to death, losing jobs, police and fire personnel are being laid off by the hundreds, and at the same time, the nation is facing the same severity of economic meltdown now occurring throughout many other industrialized nations. All of this is happening in the vicinity of Rob's local place, and one does not need to be an economist to understand that conditions are becoming increasingly dire all across Europe. Transition initiatives in all parts of the world will ultimately find themselves confronted by these grim economic realities, and they should be talking about them with as much focus as they are directing toward Peak Oil and climate change. As frightening as the consequences of Peak Oil will be, the consequences of a global economic collapse are beginning to bring similar or worse realities to our doors with dizzying speed. In fact, currency wars, gargantuan amounts of debt, and a worldwide crisis in food production and food prices - all of which are happening now, may ultimately make the consequences of Peak Oil seem anticlimactic.\nAll of this leads up to a statement by Rob that I find appalling: \"I get a sense from"

The White House says a costly spending bill President Barack Obama signed into law five years ago Monday was good for the economy and helped the U.S. avoid another Great Depression. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\nRANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP)  -  The costly $787 billion spending bill that President Barack Obama signed into law soon after taking office boosted the economy and helped avoid another Great Depression, the White House said in a status report on Monday's fifth anniversary of the law's enactment.\nRepublican leaders in Congress took note of the anniversary, too, but argued that the bill spent too much for too little in return.\nWhite House economic adviser Jason Furman said the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act made other targeted investments that will pay dividends for years to come.\nBy itself, the stimulus bill saved or created an average of 1.6 million jobs a year for four years through the end of 2012, Furman said in a White House blog post.\nHalf of the total fiscal support for the economy, or about $689 billion, from the recovery act and subsequent measures was in the form of tax cuts directed mostly at families. The remainder was spent on such things as rebuilding roads and bridges, preventing teacher layoffs and providing temporary help for people who lost their jobs or needed other assistance because of the poor economy.\nThe report said recovery act spending will have a positive effect on long-run growth, boost the economy's potential output and ultimately offset much of the law's initial cost.\nMore than 40,000 miles of roads and more than 2,700 bridges have been upgraded, nearly 700 drinking water systems serving more than 48 million people have been brought into compliance with federal clean water standards and high-speed Internet was introduced to about 20,000 community institutions.\n\"While these figures are substantial, they still nevertheless understate the full magnitude of the administration's response to the crisis,\" Furman wrote.\nHe noted that the report focused solely on the effects of fiscal legislation. It did not evaluate other administration policies that aided the recovery, such as stabilizing the financial system, rescuing the auto industry and supporting the housing sector.\nRepublicans were in less of a mood to celebrate.\n\"The 'stimulus' has turned out to be a classic case of big promises and big spending with little results,\" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a written statement. \"Five years and hundreds of billions of dollars later, millions of families are still asking 'Where are the jobs?'\"\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., argued that Obama could put the nation's finances on a more solid footing and create jobs by taking steps to roll back regulations and finally approve the Keystone XL pipeline project from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\"Five years later, the stimulus is no success to celebrate,\" said McConnell. \"It is a tragedy to lament.\"\nFurman said the economy is \"undoubtedly in a stronger position\" because it has grown for 11 straight months, although not at a pace that would be considered robust. Businesses have also added 8.5 million jobs since early 2010. Obama initially sold the stimulus as an investment that would produce a dramatic decrease in unemployment that ultimately did not materialize.\nUnemployment remains high, at 6.6 percent in January, though it has fallen considerably since reaching double-digit highs early in Obama's administration. Some of the decline, however, is due to people dropping out of the workforce. People aren't considered unemployed if they aren't looking for work.\n\"While far more work remains to ensure that the economy provides opportunity for every American, there can be no question that President Obama's actions to date have laid the groundwork for stronger, more sustainable economic growth in the years ahead,\" Furman said.\nObama planned to discuss the economy Tuesday at a suburban Washington distribution center for the Safeway grocery store chain. On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden will mark the recovery act's fifth anniversary during a visit to America's Central Port in Granite City, Ill.\nAbout the Author: - Associated Press\nYou must be logged in to post a comment. \" US Navy ready to deploy laser for 1st time Tesla protests bills that would limit expansion \" Business Review"

        "webpage": "Illegal immigration is our best foreign aid program\n\nAugust 06, 2007|By Gregory Clark\n\nAbout 160 million people with incomes a fifth or less than the average U.S. income live less than 1,500 miles from our southern border. Given this huge income gap, more border agents and more miles of fence cannot prevent substantial illegal migration. But such migration is actually the United States' most effective foreign aid program, helping some of the poorest people in the world. Some believe such migration should be tolerated, not fought to the death.\n\nA look at history suggests that even as illegal migration ebbs and flows, it will remain a problem for the United States. Before 1800, incomes per person varied by small amounts across borders. Consequently, there was modest pressure for illegal migrations. But since then, the world economy has experienced a process called the \"great divergence.\" Paradoxically, as barriers to the flow of goods and information have declined, the differences in living standards between the rich and poor economies have widened.\n\nThe United States happens to be located on one of the stark fault lines of the great divergence. Despite the liberalization of the Mexican economy since 1982 and trade liberalization measures such as the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993, income per person in Mexico has recently declined compared with that in the United States. Per-capita income in Mexico now averages 22 percent of that in America - the biggest gap since 1950. But Mexico is rich compared with Central America and the Caribbean. Other countries have seen more severe declines and have incomes per capita less than 10 percent that of the United States: Honduras and Haiti are at 6 percent and Nicaragua is at 9 percent. Mexico has its own problem of illegal migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nNot only have incomes of our southern neighbors declined relative to those in the United States, their populations have increased.\n\nThis divergence of incomes between the United States and its southern neighbors makes the enforcement of border controls increasingly difficult. As long as there are huge potential gains, illegal immigrants will be willing to endure more - and to try more often - to enter the United States.\n\nAcross such a long border, more agents and better technology can slow the inward march of migrants but it cannot halt it.\n\nCan the United States forestall the relative decline of the economies on its southern fringe? No. The evidence from history is that the rise and decline of economies is beyond the reach of economic policy. The British ran India from 1857 to 1947 with a set of economic policies that would have brought pride to the heart of the most pro-market modern economist: free markets, absolute security of property, price stability, low taxes, free mobility of capital and entrepreneurs. Yet, in that same interval, Indian income declined relative to that of Britain.\n\nIn such a situation, recognizing that there will be some flow of labor across this wealth divide, and periodically legalizing those who manage to find their way to the U.S. labor market, is not a bad option. The United States' biggest foreign aid program is not the $19 billion that it sends through official aid channels (a mere 0.14 percent of gross domestic product) worldwide. Instead, it is the employment it provides for the many millions of illegal immigrants in the United States from the Third World, mainly Latin America. The earnings of these migrants, which some estimate at more than $200 billion a year, easily dwarf official U.S. aid contributions.\n\nThe remittances these immigrants send back to relatives in their home countries - more than $25 billion annually just to Mexico, according to the World Bank - far outweigh official aid. And unlike that aid, a large share is not absorbed by bureaucrats and consultants but goes directly to the poor.\n\nSo a little live-and-let-live when it comes to immigration is not just prudent, it is also compassionate.\n\nGregory Clark is a professor of economics at University of California, Davis and author of the forthcoming \"A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World.\" This article originally appeared in the Los Angeles Times."

One of these is trade and investment - a vital engine for growth and integration. Recent decades have seen an enormous expansion in trade and investment flows in the Asia-Pacific region. Regional economies are increasingly part of global value chains. This has helped foster the economic dynamism that has lifted many from poverty and spread prosperity more widely. At the same time, however, too many individuals and communities remain excluded from the benefits of trade and investment. Review of Developments in Transport in Asia and the Pacific 20137 Nov 2013Flagship publications and book series While transport has been an essential element in the rapid growth and economic development of Asia and the Pacific, the sector is now at a crossroads more than ever before. Rocketing demand for transport services is putting extreme pressure on existing infrastructure at a time when public budgets are constrained and awareness about the negative externalities of transport activities is growing. The challenge is therefore to ensure that today's transport policies and investments will contribute to a sustainable and inclusive development path for the future. Dealing with challenges for making trade inclusive 1 Nov 2013Working paper series Trade has the potential to contribute to economic growth and to more and better jobs. Whether trade contributes to growth that is inclusive, in the sense that all people can contribute to and benefit from growth triggered by trade, is likely to depend on country specificities including institutional pre-conditions and policies applied in domains other than trade.

        "webpage": "Report | Jobs and Unemployment Understanding the Jobs Crisis | American Jobs Plan\nView PDF Download PDF\nShare this page: Understanding the Jobs Crisis\nAlmost 16 million Americans are out of work. They are our husbands and wives. Our children, our parents. Our neighbors. The supply of willing workers is overwhelming, but we don't have the demand to match. Americans want to work. Putting the American people back to work is not only an economic imperative, but a moral one as well. Americans value hard work, independence, and personal responsibility. American workers are remarkably resilient and have an unrivaled work ethic. In the face of these challenging economic times, Americans who have jobs are working hard, gaining new skills, caring for their parents, and providing for their children. Americans who don't have jobs are doing everything they can to find work. Their quiet resilience has been a little-noticed source of our nation's strength and it can also be a wellspring for our nation's renewal.\nThe United States is facing its worst unemployment crisis of the last 70 years. Nearly 16 million Americans are out of work, one-third of whom have been jobless for over six months. Another 9.3 million Americans are working part time because they can't find the full-time jobs they want and need. The jobs shortage is so severe that there are now six unemployed workers for every job vacancy - double the ratio in the prior recession of the early 2000s.\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed earlier this year helped to pull the economy out of its nosedive and to dampen mounting job losses. Still, the jobs crisis has persisted, and it is likely that unemployment will remain above 8% even two years from now in the absence of bold and decisive action to create jobs. The employment situation is an economic and moral crisis for the nation and requires an adequate, comprehensive response by the federal government. By itself, the private sector is unable to create jobs in the numbers the United States needs for a robust, full economic recovery.\nThe Economic Policy Institute recommends a five-point American Jobs Plan to create jobs and stem the unemployment crisis. The plan calls for the nation to strengthen the safety net (including unemployment compensation, COBRA health coverage, and nutrition assistance); provide fiscal relief to state and local governments; make renewed investments in transportation and schools; support direct creation of public service jobs; and establish a new job creation tax credit.\nThe American Jobs Plan is an efficient and effective way to create jobs. We estimate that the plan will create at least 4.6 million jobs in the first year, at a total first-year gross cost of roughly $400 billion. This entire cost can be recouped within 10 years by enacting a financial transactions tax (FTT), which would take effect three years after enactment. An FTT is a highly progressive way to raise revenue by imposing a small tax on the sale of stocks and other financial products.\nIntroduction: The jobs crisis\nThe United States is facing its worst unemployment crisis in 70 years. In October, the unemployment rate reached double-digits for the first time in a quarter century; now nearly 16 million Americans are unemployed. Another 9.3 million are working part time even though they want full-time work. Overall, the nation has an underemployment rate of 17.5%, or 27.4 million people.\nAmong the 15.7 million jobless workers, one in every three has been out of a job for six months or more. These long-term jobless represent 3.6% of the total labor force, far exceeding the previous peak of 2.6% set in June 1983. More than 2 million workers have already been unemployed for more than a year. There is only one job vacancy for every six people unemployed.\nAverage unemployment rates mask an even bleaker reality for many Americans. Among African American and Latino workers, the unemployment rate has reached 15.7% and 13.1%, respectively. In Michigan, where the unemployment crisis has taken its toughest toll, unemployment reached 15.1% in October 2009.\nUnemployment among men has reached 11.4%. Among blue-collar workers, unemployment is 50% higher than the national average. White-collar unemployment is 6.8%, which may seem low but is higher than all but the two worst months of the 1980s recession. And while college graduates have a comparatively low rate of unemployment (4.7%), it is still the highest jobless rate on record for that group.\nUnemployment would be even higher had there not been an actual drop of 903,000 in the size of the labor force over the last year when normally we would expect labor force growth of nearly 1.5 million. A primary reason for this contraction is that the dismal labor market convinced many people to give up looking for work; these labor force dropouts are therefore no longer counted among the unemployed. Nevertheless, the steep rise in unemployment, up 5.3 percentage points since the start of the recession, is even greater than the rise in unemployment in the deep recession of the 1980s.\nThe United States has lost 8 million jobs (5.9% of all jobs) during the recession so far, the sharpest drop since World War II."

        "webpage": "In pension debate, experts deride well-publicized non-profit study on the health of municipal plans\nMichael Van Sickler, Tampa Bay Times\nWednesday, February 13, 2013 4:53pm\nTALLAHASSEE - Actuarial and financial investment experts told lawmakers Wednesday that an oft-quoted study by two non-profits is exaggerating the problems facing pensions for city and county workers throughout Florida.\nFlorida Senate panel proposes $650M increase to K-12 education funding in 2016-17\nComputer coding could count as foreign language for high-schoolers\nFlorida Senate moves ahead with \"choice in sports\" proposal\nThe LeRoy Collins Institute and Florida TaxWatch released a report this week that updates its research on 492 pension plans throughout Florida. It concluded that it had detected a \"troubling trend\" since 2010 where payouts are exceeding contributions in the typical plan. The report is part of a raft of studies that Republican lawmakers are using to warrant an overhaul of state and local government pensions by shuffling employees into 401 (k)-type plans and away from plans that guarantee retirement benefits. The LCI study isn't calling for the shutting down of municipal pension funds, but it is recommending some fixes for local governments to adopt to avoid future shortfalls. They are the raising of the minimum age of retirees before they receive benefits; the elimination of overtime pay in calculating pension benefits; the making of pension benefits that are more transparent to the public and changing the interpretation of a 1999 law that would allow cities and counties to more flexibility in negotiating benefits with their police and fire unions. But Brad Heinrichs, the CEO of a Fort Myers actuarial firm that manages 200 public pensions in Florida, told a House committee on government operations that the premise of the LCI study was flawed. In estimating each plan's liabilities, LCI was projecting salary increases that hadn't been awarded yet, giving the impression that the plans had much greater burdens then they do. \"It certainly makes the plans look worse off than I think they are,\" said Heinrichs, who said he came to Wednesday's meeting on his own. \"You might call that conservative, but I call it aggressive.\" \"What you're saying is that these numbers are way off,\" Rep. Irv Slosberg, D-Boca Raton asked. \"I've been trying not to say 'way off',\" Heinrichs said. \"But I would say it's too strict of a grading scale.\" Heinrichs and Joseph Bogdahn, an investment manager at an Orlando firm, said that a slumping stock market was largely to blame for flat returns from pension funds in recent years. But they both said that was about to change and now was not the time to overreact. \"Sometimes, doing nothing is like taking action,\" Bogdahn said. \"Most of the funds are doing just fine.\" But Republicans who are pressing for changes were still leaning toward doing something. The Senate's efforts to reform municipal pensions is expected to be wrapped into a House bill that would require new school district, county, state, university, and community college employees who now can now enroll in the Florida Retirement System's pension plan to instead sign up for a 401 (k) plan by next January. That reform is a top priority with House Speaker Will Weatherford. Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, chairs the House committee on government operations and said he felt that the criticism of the LCI report was unfair. He said that Heinrichs, who told the committee that actuaries don't set uniform standards for the solvency of pension plans, had no place to question the findings in the LCI report. \"It's disingenuous,\" Brodeur said. \"(The LCI report) will be another piece we'll use to figure out where we are with funding levels for our municipal pensions.\" [Last modified: Wednesday, February 13, 2013 4:53pm]"

        "webpage": "Reform Is Not Enough to Restore Trust in Wall St., Experts Say Confidence in free enterprise, business overall is rising\nKnut Rostad, president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, hosted a conference call Thursday to discuss research conducted by American Enterprise Institute and Labaton Sucharow about Americans' attitudes toward Wall Street and financial professionals.\nOn the call were Kevin Carroll, managing director and associate general counsel for Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA); Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at American Enterprise Institute; and Jordan Thomas, partner at Labaton Sucharow.\n\"Fiduciary duties buttress investor trust, the central pillar on which financial trust exists,\" Rostad said. He referred to data from Harris Interactive that found in 2012, the firms with the best reputations among consumers among the 60 most visible companies were Amazon, Apple, Disney and Google while Goldman Sachs, AIG and Bank of America held positions in the bottom five.\nRostad referred to another survey by Makovsky + Co that found 96% of marketing officials at leading financial firms invite negative opinion through their own action or inaction.\n\"Confidence in the amorphous entity known as Wall Street remains relatively low,\" Carroll said. \"Five years since the crisis, financial firms hold much more capital in terms of quality and quantity. Our industry has long advocated financial reform, including many regulations in the Dodd-Frank Act. We embrace the view that reform alone is not enough to restore trust. Our industry must redouble efforts to demonstrate actions to enhance trust. Without effort, the good intentions of a rule will be lost.\"\nCarroll listed three strategies that the financial services industry need to enact to regain consumers' trust.\nExpend greater energy on policies that put client interests first\nInform regulatory reform that promotes responsibility\nEstablish enhanced risk management effort to keep the financial system running smoothly\nCarroll referred to AEI's research, which found consumers recognize that Wall Street is important and makes a contribution to the economy.\n\"Wall Street is necessary, but what's hardened so much is the view that is has a different set of values than most people,\" Bowman said. \"Wall Street is far removed from most Americans.\" The AEI paper refers to research from Aspen Institute that found in 2012, 79% of consumers said Wall Street did not share the same values as most Americans. After the financial crash, Harris Interactive found that only a quarter of respondents agreed that people on Wall street are as moral as most Americans.\nBowman said that while there has been no recovery in attitudes toward Wall Street, banks have improved. \"Banks recovered in public opinion. Trust is regained slowly, but it can happen. We've seen that on two separate occasions,\" she said, referring to improvements in public opinion after the savings and loan crisis in the '80s. One reason for that, she suggested, is that people are more intimately connected with banks because they interact with them more frequently.\n\"Business as a whole is quite strong in American public opinion,\" Bowman added. Americans are still confident in the free enterprise system. Although they're a little less confident in capitalism, she suggested that was because it was so closely connected to Wall Street in Americans' minds.\n\"One of the key findings [of the Labaton Sucharow research] is that Wall Street faces a serious and growing ethical crisis,\" Thomas said. \"Misconduct was both common and accepted. Over half of respondents said their competitors were probably breaking the law and 23% said they knew someone in their own firm was doing so.\n\"The financial services industry has made great strides, starting with the Dodd-Frank Act,\" Thomas continued. \"Regulation alone cannot fix these problems; policies and procedures don't get at the heart of the problem. An opportunity for the industry is to work on establishing a culture of integrity. Junior personnel were more likely to be aware of illegal behavior than senior counterparts. There's an opportunity for a responsible organization to provide more training.\"\nHe noted, too, that the cost to an unethical firm is more than monetary. \"If organizations don't make it a high priority to establish a culture of ethical behavior and internal reporting, the cost will be much higher in monetary terms as well as reputational harm.\"\n\"This is our territory,\" Carroll said, \"and we need to take a lead role in cleaning it up.\" ---\nCheck out 5 Years After Lehman Crash: 'Dark Times' Ahead on ThinkAdvisor.\nInstitute for the Fiduciary Standard\nKnut Rostad"

In this respect it was very clear that the King III Code formed the benchmark of corporate governance for these companies.\n\"It spells out clearly what the shareholder role is, what the role of the board is and what the role of the management is,\" said Mondi.\nIn addition both state-owned enterprises (SOE) and development finance institutions, such as the Industrial Development Corporation and the Development Bank of South Africa, were subject to Acts of Parliament, and ultimately accountable to the legislature.\nOne of the biggest risks was the \"blurring of responsibility\" between the shareholder's role and that of the institution \"leading to confusion and competition at managerial level and almost a failure of an SOE to effect the mandate that is given by parliament\" he said.\nState-led growth\nMondi pointed to recent developments at SAA. The airline has been under severe commercial strain after a fall-out between Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba and its former board, followed by a set of poor financial results.\n\"We've seen how companies like SAA for example are battling these issues and in the process leading to institutional confusion and uncertainty within a company that should be focusing on its mandate, in this case [transporting] people cheaper, efficiently and on time,\" he said.\nHe also raised concerns over the appointment of securocrats to institutions such as the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), which is currently undergoing restructuring. Last year Mo Shaik, formerly head of the security services, was appointed to head the bank's international division, which is to be relaunched as a DBSA subsidiary. Finance Mininster Pravin Gordhan defended Shaik's appointment, stating at the time that Shaik proved the best candidate following a rigorous selection process.\nThere were some good lessons to be learnt from the Chinese model, he said, but governance risks threatened to undermine the \"very bold and positive\" steps government was taking to drive economic growth and development.\nThe emphasis on state-led growth presented positive opportunities for South Africa in a number of respects including as an infrastructure provider to southern Africa. Localisation requirements by government on large projects had also encouraged the entrance of multinational companies, which had invested locally in South Africa.\nDA takes Gigaba to task over SAA imbroglio\nSAA and the R550-million bailout\nState-owned enterprises given extra slices of the budget pie\n'State-owned entities must be more efficient'\nstate-owned entities\nstate-owned enterprises\nAfrican Frontiers Forum"

Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, announced Tuesday that they will push for a new state-administered trust fund to give low-income private sector workers and self-employed people access to an individual retirement account.Osten said the retirement system would be based on contributions made by the workers and would not call for contributions from the state or employers. The cost to employees would be low because administrative fees would be lower than those of plans currently offered in the private market, advocates said.The provisions in the new legislative bill would be based on Senate Bill 54 from last year, Osten said.If passed, the new trust fund would be called the Connecticut Retirement Security Trust Fund. The proposal calls for it to be managed by a board chaired by the state treasurer and comptroller.About 740,000 Connecticut residents are not enrolled in an employer-provided retirement plan, according to a report by the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis, cited by advocates for the plan.Dorry Clay of Stonington, who owns a one-person graphic design company, said she has had no feasible way to save for her retirement. She said she has been an artist all her life but started the business after losing her job during the recession. She was diagnosed with cancer, which wiped out her savings.\"I don't want to have to work until I am 70 or older because I can't afford to retire,\" she said. \"The public retirement plan is an absolute no-brainer.\"Employers with five or more employees would be required to offer employees a payroll deduction option to join the trust program.The default employee contribution would not be less than 3 percent of their salary, under the provisions of last year's bill being proposed as a model.When asked whether the state should start up a retirement plan for private employees after managing its public pensions so poorly, Osten said yes.\"This publicly run retirement fund would not require an employer piece to it, and therefore, would not have that piece of the problem that has happened,\" Osten said.The state's two main public pension systems, one for teachers and one for state employees, are funded at 55 percent and 42 percent of their anticipated obligations, respectively. Experts say pension systems should be funded at 80 to 100 percent.Sal Luciano, executive director of the Council for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) said the proposed public retirement plan would be at low cost to individual participants because there would be a large number of participants. Participants would have access to financial planners, he said, and would pay fees of about 0.5 percent of their retirement contributions.He compared that to a fee of 2.6 percent for some private plans.Joshua Gottfried, founder and principal of Gottfried & Somberg Wealth Management LLC in Glastonbury, said there are already low-cost retirement investment options such as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, which has more than $155 billion in assets, charges 0.17 percent and has a $15 annual fee.\"Why create a new product when knowledge is what is needed?\" he said. \"The products already exist.\"When last year's version of the bill was brought before the Appropriations Committee, several Republicans questioned why the state would create a plan when there are others already in the marketplace. They said that they would prefer the state create a marketing plan to encourage people to save for retirement instead of starting its own"

Expectations of deflation tend to push interest rates down. But short rates can't go below zero. And the Japanese long rate has to stay some ways above zero, because it in effect contains an option value: short rates can go up, but they can't go down.\nSo Japan has expected inflation that is around 2 points less than in other safe haven countries, but it has long interest rates that are only about 1 percentage point lower; Japan is a high real rate country. And this pushes up the value of the yen.\nJust to be clear, this is a bad thing from Japan's point of view; the country really needs more exports, and the high yen prevents that.\nAnother reason why you really, really don't want to get into a deflation trap.\nOlivier Blanchard at the I.M.F. Is Not Very Serious\nAnd when you bear in mind that the Very Serious People have been wrong about everything, that's a very good thing.\nWhat's even better is that as the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Blanchard is helping to make at least one international institution less austerity-mad than the others.\nHis recent blog post on the I.M.F.'s Web site on what went wrong in 2011 is, in fact, totally sensible and on point. Furthermore, if I am reading it right, it contains something of a bombshell: \"Financial investors are schizophrenic about fiscal consolidation and growth,\" he wrote on Dec. 21. \"They react positively to news of fiscal consolidation, but then react negatively later, when consolidation leads to lower growth  -  which it often does. Some preliminary estimates that the I.M.F. is working on suggest that it does not take large multipliers for the joint effects of fiscal consolidation and the implied lower growth to lead in the end to an increase, not a decrease, in risk spreads on government bonds. To the extent that governments feel they have to respond to markets, they may be induced to consolidate too fast, even from the narrow point of view of debt sustainability.\" (My emphasis.)\nIf I have this right, Mr. Blanchard is suggesting that harsh austerity programs may be literally self-defeating, hurting the economy so much that they worsen fiscal prospects. This in turn means that the analogy to medieval doctors who bled their patients, then bled them even more when the bleeding made them sicker, is exactly right: austerity reduces growth prospects, leading to calls for even more austerity.\nSerious!\nTruthout has licensed this content.

The quotient of our Gross National Income and our population resulted in $27580.\n\nAmong the members of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), Spain occupied the number 20 of its 35 members (2016), presenting an average salary of $37333. The OCDE makes a more complex calculation to obtain this figure, adding into the equation factors such as number of employees, average weekly hours of full-time and all-time employees, and Purchasing Power Parities (PPP).\n\nEurostat gives us other useful rankings/statistics even if the latest available ones are from 2014. Spain's median gross hourly earnings were almost 10\u20ac, 13th position in the EU list of 28. In terms of the percentage of employees making less than two thirds of the median gross hourly earnings, we found that almost 14% of the employees in Spain fall in that category, putting us in the 19th position out of 28. In this case, Latvia, Romania and Lithuania were first with around 25% of their workforce there, and Finland, Belgium and Sweden were last with around 5%.\n\nThese findings lead us to think that, despite some outrageous compensation executives' exiting packages we have observed in the last years, the average wages should not be excessively inflated by executives' big salaries, showing also that inequality is, on paper, lower than in most of other EU countries.\n\nAccording to the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spanish Statistics Bureau), the average annual gross salary in 2016 was \u20ac22771, whereas the average annual total cost for what employers have to pay was \u20ac30311 (the main contribution to that figure are Social Security employers' contributions (\u20ac7056 average per worker)).\n\nContinuing with the 2016 Annual Labour Costs Survey where these figures come from, the regions with higher net labour costs (calculating by subtracting from the gross labour costs the figure (small amount) of employment subsidies from Public Administration) were Madrid, Basque Country (Bilbao as its main city), and Catalonia (Barcelona). The lower ones are found in Extremadura (Badajoz), Canary Islands (Las Palmas and Santa Cruz), and Galicia (Coru\u00f1a).\n\nPer industries, the Spanish Statistics Bureau found (in 2014) that on average the highest annual wages were found in energy delivery, minerals extraction, finance and insurance, and information technologies (IT). The lowest ones were registered in retail, entertainment, administrative tasks, and hospitality. Interestingly, many people coming from abroad are employed in finance, IT, and hospitality. Other activities where they are employed are healthcare and teaching (both slightly over average).\n\nNote that although some years have gone by since these surveys were run, there has been close to zero inflation, together with a stable situation during this period, making us think that today's picture is similar.\n\nAlthough I find that, overall, salaries are low in Spain, in a future post we will get into more details by mainly analysing how much your money can buy you here. Nevertheless, you can also make some assumptions/observations as of the Cost of Living post mentioned at the beginning.\n\nWhat's you view on wages in Spain? How do they compare to other places you have been in? Any industry you recommend from that perspective? And region?"

On Thursday night the initial public offering of its own stock priced at $16, the low end of what the company had originally predicted.\nIf only the problems stopped there.\nShortly after starting to trade, the share price plunged to just pennies before being halted. By late afternoon, BATS withdrew its public offering and said it had no plans to refile its IPO. All trades made that day would be canceled.\nThere was more bad news. Apple Inc.'s stock was temporarily halted following a faulty trade on BATS's systems. BATS also suspended trading of all stocks whose ticker symbols began with A through BF, though it restored that trading by early afternoon.\n\"We have an electronic mess,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading for broker Themis Trading.\nThe botched IPO was a blow not only to the exchange, but to a new business for which it had high hopes. In February, BATS offered free listings to companies whose shares traded a certain amount each day, hoping to draw IPOs away from Nasdaq and the NYSE.\nBATS, whose motto is \"Making Markets Better,\" strove to define itself as a tech-savvy exchange and said companies would benefit from its \"world-class customer support and technology.\"\nTo help the business, BATS picked a new listing that would be sure to garner attention: itself.\nThe irony was hard to miss.\n\"It was the biggest day of the life of the company, and their own stock melts down,\" says Larry Tabb, CEO of Tabb Group, a markets research firm. \"This doesn't build confidence.\"\nBATS is one of several dozen relatively new companies that offer high-speed, low-cost electronic stock trading as an alternative to the NYSE and Nasdaq. Making up about 12 percent of all U.S. stock trading, it's the third-largest stock exchange in the country behind NYSE and Nasdaq.\nBATS spokesman Randy Williams said in an email that the company's systems have been \"extremely reliable\" in the past. \"I'm not saying that atones for today, just that we've been considered the industry gold standard for the past several years.\"\nThe trading problems Friday brought comparisons to the May 6, 2010, \"flash crash,\" when a crush of electronic trading glitches caused a stomach-churning plunge in the markets. They also raised questions about the safety of new trading systems such as BATS.\nHigh-frequency trading driven by powerful computers and complex mathematical formulas has largely elbowed out guys in jackets on the NYSE floor as the main source of trading. The computers comb the markets for securities priced too high or too low for a split-second, then trade on them.\nWhile computer glitches aren't unusual in the fast-paced world of high-frequency trading, this embarrassment couldn't have come at a worse, or more public, time for BATS. With memories of the flash crash still fresh, regulators have been taking a closer look at high-frequency trading firms."

        "webpage": "The New American Dream comments Workers don't share in companies' productivity gains By Tami Luhby @Luhby March 7, 2013: 9:01 AM ET The gap between hourly compensation and productivity is at a post-World War II high. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Companies are on a tear in terms of productivity and profits, but they aren't sharing much of the gains with their workers. The gap between hourly compensation and productivity is the highest it's been since just after World War II. This divergence is one of the major drivers of the nation's growing income inequality. \"A bigger share of what businesses in the U.S. are producing is going to the owners of the firms and the people who lent money to the firm, and a smaller share is going to workers,\" said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at The Brookings Institution. (Related: Stressful jobs that pay badly) Productivity, which measures the goods and services generated per hour worked, rose by 80.4% between 1973 and 2011, compared to a 10.7% growth in median hourly compensation, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, which crunched the numbers last year. That's a marked shift from the trend between 1948 and 1973, when productivity and compensation grew in tandem. The main reason for the wider gap is a dampening of wage growth in recent decades, both among the college-educated and those without degrees, said Lawrence Mishel, the institute's president. Global competition and national deregulation have kept compensation down, while the decline of union power weakened workers' ability to bargain for higher pay. The split has been particularly acute since the beginning of the 2000s, when wage growth flattened. And now, with unemployment hovering around 8%, workers feel lucky to have a job and aren't pressing as much for raises. \"Companies are using that power to get a better deal out of workers,\" Burtless said. One woman with 6 jobs to make ends meet Employers are achieving their gains with fewer workers, too. U.S. economic activity is now 2.5% higher than it was when the recession began in late 2007, but there are more than 3 million fewer workers on the job, said Mark Perry, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Looking at hourly compensation alone doesn't tell the whole story, though, because it doesn't include benefits. They make up about 30% of a worker's total compensation, and their cost has been rising over time, Perry said. He attributes the gap to market forces, and he expects it will narrow as the economy recovers. As things improve, the labor market will tighten and companies will raise wages, Perry said, pointing to the energy boom in North Dakota, which has prompted employers there to boost compensation. \"It's just taking a while,\" he said.

        "webpage": "Over the next four decades, increasing old-age dependency ratios exert an enormous upward pressure on welfare spending in most developed countries. As this is mainly due to existing unfunded public pension schemes, many countries have embarked on far-reaching reforms in this area, strengthening actuarial fairness, modifying indexation rules, adding elements of prefunding and, last but not least, attempting to extend the period of economic activity. Efforts to contain costs may also be relevant with regard to public expenditure on health and long-term care but, thus far, no country has started to really deal with these issues. Still, some countries have made substantial progress in securing the long-term sustainability of their welfare systems. What remains to be considered is re-constructing the system of intergenerational transactions as a potential way of removing disincentives to raise children and invest in their human capital in the long run."

It is to identify what mid-course adjustments can be made that will bring us onto the best path towards those goals.\"\nThe Compact Review focuses on four status indicators: FSM's general social, political and economic conditions; the use and effectiveness of US financial, program and technical assistance in FSM; FSM's economic policy reforms; and FSM's efforts to increase investments in the country, be it private investment or Compact and non-Compact Trust Funds investment.\nTo date, the CRC has produced a first draft of the FSM Compact Review Report and traveled to Washington D.C. recently to discuss Compact Review matters with Anthony Babauta, Assistant Secretary of the US Department of the Interior, Nikolao Pula, Director of the US Office of Insular Affairs (OIA), and other key officials of the US Government.\nThe U.S. Compact Review team is led by Tom Bussanich, Director of OIA Division of Budget & Grant Management, and assisted by Wali Osman, OIA Economist, and other staff from the OIA Honolulu field office. The US Review Report, as mandated by U.S. P.L. 108-188 Section 104 (h), is to be submitted to the US Congress no later than the end of the calendar year following the first five years of the amended Compact. That Report must include the FSM Government's comments.\nNimea summarized, based on the CRC's findings, that to promote FSM's efforts for economic advancement and budgetary self-reliance, the country needs to focus on the following: the development in the areas of human resource, economic infrastructure and private sector; the institution of internal policy reforms to impose a new direction for the economy; improve funding of the Compact Trust Fund and fully adjust inflation to increase the purchasing power of each dollar of Compact grant funds received.\nRegarding the overall FSM economy and private sector development, Samuel Brazys, SBOC Senior Economist, highlighted that the FSM GDP has been more or less stagnant for the past fifteen years. He explained the stagnation is the result of economic \"Dutch Disease.\" Dutch Disease is an economic situation caused when consumers receive and spend money from external sources, triggering local businesses to shift their efforts to retail and service industries, rather than production of \"tradable\" goods, such as manufactured, agricultural or aquaculture products. The danger being that once the external sources of money dry up, the purchase power of local citizens may no longer be able to afford supporting the retail industry and the private sector will crash.\nBrazys stressed that to develop the private sector, the country needs to create a hospitable infrastructure environment with reliable means of transportation, communications and energy (\"economic infrastructure\"). Brazys stressed that of the $260 million allocated to projects under the Amended Compact, 30% has gone to fund economic infrastructure, whereas 55% has gone to fund social infrastructure projects such as health and education. The CRC suggests working within both the Compact infrastructure sector grant, as well as with other financing options such as Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and foreign country donors to secure more funding for economic infrastructure projects.\nAddressing Internal Policy Reforms would mean passing appropriate laws and regulations that support private sector development, such as expanding Intellectual Property Rights and Competition Policy. And as far the Compact Trust Fund is concerned, Brazys said economic data shows the Compact Trust Fund still needs annual contributions of $12.5 million to avoid a risk of recession by 2024.\nFor further information on this release, please contact:\nFSM Office of the President\nPublic Information: Press, Radio, Video\nP.O Box 34\nPalikir Station, Pohnpei, FM 96941\nTel.: (691) 320-2548/2092\nFax.: (691) 320-4356\ne-mail: \n\nReturn to the News and Public Statements Page\nReturn to the FSM Government Home Page"

        "webpage": "Bernanke: Fed Action To Stimulate Economy, Fight High Unemployment 9/13/2012 3:35 PM ET Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke Thursday said that aggressive new action from the central bank was justified in the face of concerns about a still-sluggish economy.Bernanke spoke to reporters after the Fed announced plans to buy $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities each month, starting Friday.In addition to embarking on a third round of quantitative easing, the Fed also extended its vow to keep interest rates at rock-bottom rates to mid-2015. Policy makers also decided to keep in place the Operation Twist program that swaps short-term bonds for longer-term assets.The Fed also revised upward its projections for economic growth in 2013, suggesting an expectation that the move announced Thursday, in combination with policy actions from Congress, would further boost the economy.The new projections forecast 2.5 to 3.0 percent annual GDP growth for the year, up from 2.2 to 2.8 percent growth predicted in June. The upper range of expectations for growth in 2014 was also revised up from 3.5 percent to 3.8 percent.Bernanke said the new measures were needed to combat unemployment that remains persistently and unacceptably high.Striking a populist tone, the high unemployment rate, now at 8.1 percent, is \"imposing hardship\" and a \"tremendous waste of human skills and talents\" in the broader economy, Bernanke said.The Fed will continue its actions to support employment until it sees substantial and sustained improvements in both the labor market and the broader economy, Bernanke said.And while the Fed will \"as always\" take appropriate action in the face of rising inflation, Bernanke went to great pains to emphasize that Fed efforts to improve the economy would not be pulled back at the first signs of improvement.\"The idea is to quicken the recovery... help the economy grow quickly enough to generate new jobs,\" he said.He added, \"We haven't at this point come up with a set of data we can put out\" to determine when the Fed might pull back from its actions but any backing away is \"not going to be premature... we're not going to rush to tighten policy... for some time.\"At the same time, Bernanke said that the Fed remains aware and understanding of its dual mandate and the need to keep inflation under control.However, he said, just because there are some signs of inflation in the recovery as \"slack\" from the recession is made up, that does not mean that the Fed will tighten monetary policy.\"We don't anticipate the economy overheating anytime soon,\" he said. He added, \"We want to see more jobs. We want to see lower unemployment.\"Bernanke repeatedly cautioned that there were limits to what the Fed can do on its own.\"Monetary policy is not a panacea,\" he said. \"We can't solve this problem on our own.\"He added, \"We think we can make a meaningful contribution to this problem... but we can't solve it.\"Specifically, Bernanke reiterated his warnings that Congress and the Administration need to take action to avoid the \"fiscal cliff\" of tax increases and spending cuts that are scheduled to go into effect at the beginning of the year.The Congressional Budget Office has warned that if those policies - enacted as a measure to push lawmakers to reach a less painful deal - could cause unemployment to rise and even potentially push the economy back into recession.\"If the fiscal cliff isn't addressed ... I don't think our tools are strong enough\" to save the economy in the face of that kind of fiscal shock, Bernanke said.He added, however, that he did hope and expect policymakers in Congress and the White House to take actions needed to avert that eventuality.\"Our tools are not so powerful that they can solve the problem [but we] are able, at least to provide meaningful support,\" he said. \"If we have tools that we think can provide some assistance ... our obligation is to do what we can.\" by RTT Staff WriterFor comments and feedback: Business News"

        "webpage": "Home / Publications / Journal Of Indexes / Why It Is (Still) All About Sectors\nWhy It Is (Still) All About Sectors\nAugust 25, 2009 ETF.com Staff The financial panic of 2008 left scars that will linger for years. In addition to destroying trillions of dollars, it has also forced many investors to re-evaluate the way they think about risk and asset allocation. Some have argued that asset allocation itself is dead. In an attempt to find diversification wherever it exists, others have poured money into nontraditional assets such as commodities, managed futures or inverse products that seek to rise in value as the market declines. A traditional financial asset remains, however, that provides investors with opportunities for diversification and the potential for increased return. The asset is neither new, leveraged nor based on some esoteric financial instrument that has yet to be proven or fully understood. Rather, the asset is based on an investment strategy that is one of the oldest and most established in investment history - and is really better termed \"assets.\" I am, of course, referring to the different economic sectors. Although they often tend to be overlooked in discussions of asset allocation, a growing body of evidence is forming that suggests that it is sector - not style or country - allocations that may be the most important driver of risk, return and performance in a portfolio. This paper will explore the potential benefits of diversifying by sector and compare the diversification benefits of a sector approach versus style and country allocations. Furthermore, it will explore the danger in failing to appreciate the importance of sector allocations when it comes to index and portfolio construction. Finally, it will highlight the benefits of sector exchange-traded funds and how they can be used to manage sector risk.\nThe Importance Of Sectors\nIt is rare to watch a financial news story or listen to an investment expert, fund manager or economist who does not explicitly mention sectors. The investment research function at both buy- and sell-side firms is organized primarily along sector lines. When it comes to performance reporting both for institutional investors and fund managers, the dominant source of attribution is sector allocation. Political discussions routinely mention the impact of legislation on the energy, utility, financial, health care, consumer and technology sectors, just to name a few. The reason that sectors receive so much attention from both the financial community and society as a whole is that they are truly unique economic entities. As such, they each respond differently to a given set of circumstances. These circumstances may be recurring factors such as the ebb and flow of the business cycle, or single events such as changes in government policy or improvements in technology. In either case, the impact of the economic environment will be felt in very different ways depending upon the sector in question. The divergent nature of sector returns is highlighted in Figure 1, which shows the performance of the S&P 500 by sector since 1994. As shown, over the past 15 years, the average difference between the best-performing sector and the worst was just under 50 percent per year.* The mathematical product of diverging returns is a series of assets with low correlations to one another. Figure 2 shows the correlations of the 10 sectors defined by the MSCI/S&P Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, within the S&P 500. While there are clearly some sectors with high correlations to the S&P 500 (industrials, technology and discretionary), there are several with low correlations. In fact, half of the sectors have a correlation to the S&P 500 of 0.7 or less, a number which is useful in measuring diversification potential. The low correlations of sectors make them ideal candidates for asset allocation. Not only can individual sectors provide diversification by not always moving in tandem with one another, they are also easily identifiable and mutually exclusive, facilitating their use in portfolio construction. For example, it is very hard to confuse a technology stock with a utility company. By contrast, it is not uncommon to see a stock shift from growth one quarter to value the next. The unique characteristics of sectors are timeless; in other words, it is very unlikely that the returns of technology and utility companies will suddenly converge over time, due to the fundamental differences in their business models. As a result, it is probably safe to say that the low correlations that exist today also existed in 1950 and should be expected to exist in 2050. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for other asset class distinctions.\nView the discussion thread.

No investment book in history had either the immediate impact, or the long-term relevance and value, of its first edition in 1934. By 1951, seventeen years past its original publication and more than a decade beyond its revised and acclaimed 1940 second edition, authors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd had seen business and investment markets travel from the depths of Depression to the heights of recovery, and had observed investor behavior during both the calm of peacetime and the chaos of World War II. The prescient thinking and insight displayed by Graham and Dodd in the first two editions of Security Analysis reached new heights in the third edition. In words that could just as easily have been written today as fifty years ago, they detail techniques and strategies for attaining success as individual investors, as well as the responsibilities of corporate decision makers to build shareholder value and transparency for those investors. The focus of the book, however, remains its timeless guidance and advice--that careful analysis of balance sheets is the primary road to investment success, with all other considerations little more than distractions. The authors had seen and survived the Great Depression as well as the political and financial instabilities of World War II and were now better able to outline a program for sensible and profitable investing in the latter half of the century. Security Analysis: The Classic 1951 Edition marks the return of this long-out-of-print work to the investment canon. It will reacquaint you with the foundations of value investing--more relevant than ever in tumultuous twenty-first century markets--and allow you to own the third installment in what has come to be regarded as the most accessible and usable title in the history of investment publishing.\n Book that Launched Value Investing, with Guidance and Insights that Stand the Test of Time Security Analysis: The Classic 1951 Edition provides a rare glimpse into the fundamental building blocks of modern value investing, with insights and strategies for the modern individual investor that are as valuable today as they were more than half a century ago.

At the session, economists honored the most-recent winners of the Nobel prize in economics and presented new research for discussion and analysis. Among the findings: SAN DIEGO - If you work for a company run by a male chief executive whose wife is about to give birth to a child - particularly his firstborn - you might want to cross your fingers they have a daughter. And if you're a male worker, you might get the short end of the stick no matter the gender or birth order. The gender of a male CEO's children is significantly linked to the salary of his employees, according to new research from Aalborg University economics professor Michael Dahl, University of Maryland Smith School of Business professor Cristian Dezso and Columbia Business School professor David Gaddis Ross. Presented Friday at the annual American Economic Association meeting here, the analysis suggests some explanations for the linkage, but doesn't draw absolute conclusions. First, the bad news. In general, when a male chief executive has a baby, his workers' salaries shrink by 0.2%, or about $100, per year. That decline is driven by a 0.4% drop if the child is a son, according to the study of almost 1,600 births to more than 18,000 male CEOs at 10,655 private companies in Denmark between 1996 and 2006. But there is good news for workers: The dynamics change if the CEO and his wife have a daughter, particularly if she is their first child. Employees' wages actually go up after the delivery of a first-born daughter. And in that scenario, female employees get the larger boost, with their salary tending to grow by 1.1%, compared with a 0.6% gain for male employees. In general, female workers benefit more when a male CEO has kids, regardless of the child's gender or birth order. When a male executive has a son, female employees' salaries shrink 0.2%, compared with a 0.5% drop for male workers. And when the son is the executive's first child, female employees' salaries actually go up 0.8%. The seemingly beneficial treatment of female workers could be because becoming a father alters a male executive's view, particularly toward women, the paper suggests. Previous research shows men's esteem for their wives often rises when they become mothers and this shift may nudge male executives to also view their female employees as more competent, the authors note. Other studies have also shown that men sometimes care more about other people's well-being after having a daughter. \"I have two daughters,\" Mr. Ross said. \"Do I think having kids has influenced me? Heck yes.\"  - Kristina Peterson Banks Still Too Big, Risky What a difference a few years makes - or not, in the case of banking regulation. Anat Admati, a Stanford University economist who studies banks and finance, said in an interview on the sidelines of the AEA meeting that despite the financial crisis and recession the world's big banks remain too large, too fragile, too indebted and too interconnected in hard-to-predict ways. Rather than building big capital cushions to protect themselves from potential losses, for example, some banks have returned cash to shareholders, she says. Banks still finance themselves heavily with debt, not equity, even though massive indebtedness, especially short-term debt, got them in trouble in the first place. This underlying fragility of the banking system augurs more crises, Ms. Admati argues. \"It's a system of booms and busts,\" she said. \"Banks lend either too much or too little. ... That's bad for the economy.\" In March, she and co-author Martin Hellwig will publish \"The Bankers' New Clothes,\" in which they offer recommendations for making banks and the financial system safer. Granted, the U.S. banking system is in a better place than it was in the depths of the financial crisis. But Ms. Admati says U.S. banks are still lacking in their ability to absorb losses. One reason, she says: They know that if they fail, the government will save them to safeguard the economy. And yet, their need for profit guides them to shun the low-margin business of making loans to small businesses in favor of riskier, but higher, returns elsewhere, such as in commercial property, Ms. Admati says. Things like structured investment vehicles-which allowed banks to invest in markets without seeming to, since the funds were off-balance sheet-aren't around anymore. But the basic incentives in the banking business remain as distorted as ever, Ms. Admati says. Her suggestion? For starters, make banks less fragile by stopping payouts to shareholders and limiting debt financing, so banks have more equity and bigger capital cushions.  - Neil Shah"

        "webpage": "China to use ASEAN meet to make Yuan an international currency\nSaibal Dasgupta , TNN 23 October 2009, 07:03pm IST\nBEIJING: China is set to use the ASEAN meet to sell the idea of making the Yuan an international currency. It is using the sense of uncertainty over the US dollar to sell a new dream of enlarged regional trade, financial support from Beijing and reduced dependence on the volatile dollar. China has also offered to contribute nearly one-third of the $120 billion economic stimulus package being worked out by ASEAN with the stated purpose of helping member-nations reduce their dependence on the International Monetary Fund. Japan offered to cough up a similar amount so that its influence in the region is not diminished. A senior Chinese official has said that the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement, which will come into being on January 1 of 2010, will result in wide scale use of the renminbi or Yuan as the regional currency. \"The upcoming CAFTA, which boasts the largest population among all the world's FTAs and allows zero-tariff on 90% of products traded between China and ASEAN, will quicken the process of RMB rationalization, \" the official Xinhua news agency quoted Xu Ningning, executive secretary general of China-ASEAN Business Council, as saying. China is trying to persuade ASEAN nations to enter into bilateral agreements for trade settlements in Yuan. At present, it has sealed such agreements with two ASEAN members, Laos and Vietnam. China recently launched the first-ever international bond in RMB in the Hong Kong market with significant success. It is pushing some Asian nations like Indonesia and Pakistan to transact business in RMB by offering them easy loans. Thailand\ufffds commerce minister Alongkorn Ponlaboot has indicated Bangkok is seriously looking at the option of using the Yuan as a medium of exchange. The Yuan could help reduce risks faced by the ASEAN countries in using the U.S. dollar, Xinhua quoted him, as saying at the 6th China-ASEAN Expo in Nanning in China\ufffds Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. China\ufffds purpose in trying to make the Yuan an international currency is manifold. Wider use of the Chinese currency in trade settlements will give a boost to its exports. It will also enhance Beijing\ufffds prestige in world markets and help it deflate criticism from the United States and other western countries that it was keeping the Yuan under strict official control. At present, only 10 per cent of the China-ASEAN bilateral trades involve settlements in the Chinese currency. Most of it takes place in border trades with other countries. Beijing is closely watching other currency trends like the use of the Thai Baht, Vietnamese Dong and the US dollar that are in circulation in places like Cambodia and trying to push the case of the Yuan. China launched a pilot programs last December by allowing selected areas to trade in Yuan with ASEAN nations. The areas are the province of Guangdong and the Yangtze River Delta (which includes Shanghai), Hong Kong and Macao. Exporters in Guangxi and Yunnan Province in southwestern China to settle trade in yuan with ASEAN. This was followed by another program, to settle cross-border trade deal in yuan in five cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Dongguan.\nChina to use ASEAN meet to make Yuan an international currency - China - World - The Times of India"

Others worry if they will have enough savings to fund the kind of life they have now - or even a more austere one.\n\nWorkplace pensions are far rarer than they were in decades past, leaving most of us to have to create our own retirement security.\n\nThe federal government, reports Wealth Professional, is opening public consultations on the growing problem of retirement security. It wants to take a harder look at pension regulations, as well as (and perhaps, the article says, in light of the Sears pension debacle), \"insolvency and bankruptcy laws.\"\n\nThe consultations want to \"improve retirement security for Canadians\" by looking at ways to ensure workplace plans are \"well funded,\" and corporate decisions are better aligned with \"pensioner and employee interests.\" The government, the article notes, talks about the improvements that have been made to government pensions, such as the OAS and GIS.\n\nWe learned recently that Canadians ought to have saved 11 times their salary by the time they are ready to retire. But in an era when workplace pensions are scarce, how can such saving be encouraged? And how do we ensure folks don't dip into the savings before it's time to live off them?\n\nIf RRSP savings were locked in people wouldn't be able to withdraw money until they reach retirement age, and at that point, if funds were be converted to an income stream people would be assure of income for life.\n\nA second idea might be to add a voluntary savings component to the CPP; this has been floated before.\n\nAnother idea might be to create investment funds for the OAS and the GIS. Right now these benefits are paid 100 per cent via taxpayer dollars. If, as is the case with the CPP, some of the dollars could be diverted to investment funds, maybe that taxpayer portion of future benefit costs could be reduced.\n\nThe real challenge is getting people to save more. One can argue truthfully that there are plenty of great savings vehicles out there that just aren't being fully used. Could the feds offer some new tax incentives to put money away?\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the government finds out on this important topic.\n\nIf you don't have a pension plan at work - and even if you do - it's always wise to put away money for retirement, which will come sooner than you think. The Saskatchewan Pension Plan offers a simple, well-run savings vehicle that is flexible and effective. You decide how much to put away, you can ramp it up or down over your career, and you get multiple options on how to receive a pension when the golden handshake comes. Be sure to check it out.\n\nWritten by Martin Biefer\n\nMartin Biefer is Senior Pension Writer at Avery & Kerr Communications in Nepean, Ontario.

        "webpage": "Supplemental Capital at the Capitol: Editor's Column\nMarch 23, 2012 \u2022 Reprints Over the last couple of years, a small coalition of credit unions has built up the background and the foot soldiers to help maneuver supplemental capital legislation through Congress. One can see where this could have been viewed by the trade associations as predatory to their business, but it's absolutely not, according to The Coalition for Credit Union Access. The group has worked very hard, and wisely I would add, to build consensus among the trades, credit unions and the regulators on what the legislation to allow credit unions to count supplemental capital toward net worth should look like and what it would mean for credit unions.\nBuilding consensus around supplemental capital has taken some doing, as the trades (at one time) and individual credit unions had different views on what form it should take. \"It's tricky. We were pleased the planets aligned,\" explained BECU Senior Vice President Parker Cann.\nThe coalition was only looking to supplement the trades' lobbying efforts as their attention was dispersed across NCUSIF premiums, interchange and member business lending on top of supplemental capital. The group met with all the interested parties and ensured all were satisfied with the precise wording of the language before it was presented to King, who was insistent upon consensus behind the bill.\nAccording to fellow member Bethpage FCU SVP Linda Armyn, BECU did a lot of the heavy lifting with the wording of the legislation and making sure a consensus could be built around it, while Bethpage worked their relationship with the bill's sponsor, Financial Services Committee member Peter King (R-N.Y.) to get the solidly bipartisan legislation introduced, which happened about a month ago. Simply getting the right legislation introduced took two years, but the coalition has been busy educating members of Congress as well as many credit unions on the legislation and what it actually does. That groundwork is paying dividends. In addition to a heavy hitter like King, the bill enjoys bicoastal co-sponsorship from Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) and 16 other geographically diverse members of Congress. The various representatives signed on from various states demonstrates the support the coalition has, despite its relative small number of official members. The group claims 40 to 45 credit unions of all sizes and trade associations as members, as well as working loosely with many others. Rep. Joe Baca (D-Calif.) signed on to officially support the legislation March 20 during GAC. The presence of 4,000 credit union leaders in Washington tends to have that effect, and more sign ups can be expected in the near term.\nThe number of co-sponsors is important to show broad enough support to get a bill to the floor of the House and passed so it can move on to the Senate. But the quality of the co-sponsors is crucial, too, and this bill has the support of many Financial Services Committee members, which is the committee of primary jurisdiction. As everyone knows from Schoolhouse Rock, the first step in the legislative process is a committee hearing and vote, but the coalition is looking to bypass all that. Having the bill introduced now means it could possibly be added as an amendment to another related bill that's already moving through Congress. Election year politics however cannot be ignored. The bipartisan support for the bill is a good sign. When the rubber hits the road though it may not be enough to survive the political quagmire.\nThe banking lobby is sure to take advantage of that situation. Banks far outspend the credit unions in campaign support, and the banks will threaten to pull support from campaigns if credit unions receive authority for supplemental capital toward their net worth. It's a consideration for members of Congress looking to hold onto their jobs.\nRecently during a Q&A I moderated for the Metropolitan Area Credit Union Management Association, ABA Senior Economist Keith Leggett questioned the NCUA's ability to regulate to the legislation. To that idea, Armyn responded, \"That's ridiculous.\" The coalition representatives pointed out that the NCUA has handled supplemental capital with regard to the low-income credit unions for quite some time. Additionally, the agency could seek counsel from the other banking regulators.\nThe key thing the bill will not do is, \"It will not alter the member ownership. That's actually in the bill,\" Cann emphasized. This is crucial to the potential success of the legislation. First, it's important intrinsically not to alter member ownership. And, in countering banker attacks to the legislation, maintaining the member ownership of credit unions is a basic tenet that the banking lobbyists would pounce on.\nThis type of collaboration is an excellent grass-roots effort and exactly the type of cooperative work the credit union community needs and will hopefully spawn more.

        "webpage": "Economists facing flak over ethics\nAre economists ethical? Short answer: no more than most. Long answer: well, it's not something they think about much.The question of ethics is starting to raise its head among economists, both overseas and in Australia, particularly in NSW. It's an issue the Sydney branch of the Economic Society is likely to start debating in the next few months.\nIllustration: Michael Mucci. The issue is arising as more economists find ways to sell their services to big business for big bucks. Business is attracted by the status, expertise and authority economists bring, and is willing to pay for it.Various aspects of conventional economics make economists susceptible to such transactions. Almost all economists believe in the market system and believe that the bigger the economy grows the better off we are. So they have an inbuilt sympathy with business and its objectives.They believe self-interest is a good thing because it's what motivates a market economy. It should never be a bad thing because it's held in check by countervailing market forces.And there's a belief among economists that their discipline is ''positive'' rather than ''normative''. It's a ''value-free'' description of how the economy actually works, not a statement of opinion about how it should work.\nIt's because of this belief that, for example, many economists take no account of the implications of their recommendations for the way income is distributed between rich and poor. That's a ''value'' question they aren't qualified to comment on and so leave to others, such as politicians.That's what they say when challenged. When they're not challenged they usually give the impression that distributional issues don't arise and economic efficiency is the only issue worth considering. In truth, the neo-classical model is loaded with values, the most important being that individualism is superior to communitarianism.So you see why ethics isn't something economists think much about. And this is reinforced by the profession's lack of organisation. Economics is unregulated; anyone can call themselves an economist (I don't, by the way).Economics has no true professional body. The Economic Society is the closest they come, but it's essentially a discussion group that anyone can join. Its other function is to sponsor the academic economists' annual conference and the main Australian economic journal (which the academics don't rate highly because it's only Australian).Without a proper professional association you could argue economists aren't a profession, just an occupation. Most are employed by governments and, these days, by banks and other financial services firms, which means they're not free to express opinions at variance with those of their employer. Academic economists are free, but often don't bother.The question of economists' ethical standards arose in the US after the global financial crisis, when impertinent journalists pointed out that academic economists were writing articles posing as independent experts, without disclosing the financial firms they were affiliated with or for whom they had done consultancy work.In Australia the spur is the rise of the new breed of economic consultancy firms, which are paid to provide allegedly independent modelling to private interests seeking to lobby governments. Sometimes even governments commission private modelling to provide evidence supporting some policy the pollies are pursuing.For some reason, when the independent consultants run their models they invariably reach conclusions that support their paying customer's proposal. Remarkable.These carefully contrived conclusions are then used to bamboozle the public, politicians and even judges who don't know enough economics to know how dodgy many modelling exercises are and how easily models can be tweaked to produce whatever answer you're seeking.The issue has reached a head in NSW, where Dr Richard Denniss, of the Australia Institute, has appeared as an expert witness in a couple of court cases disputing the ''independent'' modelling being used to claim the development of a new mine will bring huge economic benefits to the district.One judge was scathing in his condemnation of the use of an ''input/output model'' to exaggerate the indirect job creation from a project. A report by the independent Planning Assessment Commission on another project criticised the NSW Department of Planning for its uncritical acceptance of estimates of the project's economic benefits that had been challenged and were ''not credible''.Last week the department's new minister, Pru Goward, announced that it would commission separate expert economic analysis of all future major mining projects. Good luck.Issues of independence and conduct will be discussed during the NSW Economic Society's forum on cost-benefit analysis on July 18. And a later meeting of the society is expected to debate whether economists need a code of ethics. I'd start with an ethical code for modellers.Twitter: @1RossGittins\nPencils at ten paces in Smiggle stoush\nBHP axes bonus for CEO Andrew Mackenzie after $8b loss"

Stemming from connections Aubourg made while he worked at the Central Bank of Haiti, the pilot program will offer customized training and targeted technical assistance to members of the Haitian government to strengthen its institutional capacity.\n\"The ultimate goal is to provide these people with a set of skills so they can become very good at setting their own policies,\" says Aubourg. \"We want to give them the tools to negotiate with international financial institutions.\"\nHaiti is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, a fact Aubourg knows all too well - and is determined to change.\nAubourg grew up in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, and was in his late 20s before he set off to the United States as the recipient of a U.S. Agency for International Development scholarship to Indiana University. There he decided to leave civil engineering and follow his passion for public affairs. In 1995 he returned home to become acting director of the money and economic analysis department at the central bank. That was the first in a number of development positions he held throughout the Caribbean.\n\"I come to teaching from a practitioner's background in the sense that for the last 15 years I've been working as an international consultant.\"\nAubourg arrived at AU in 2005, and while he still consults, primarily for the International Monetary Fund, he is focused on educating his fellow countrymen on the intricacies of economic growth in the public sector.\nThe 20 civil servants selected by the Haitian government to participate in the AU program will take eight courses, all taught in the central bank building, and earn a certificate in public finance and public policy.\n\"They are extremely enthusiastic,\" Aubourg said of his students. \"I would hope that with time the overall situation of the country will improve. It is very interesting for me to notice that there is quite a large Haitian diaspora outside of Haiti. For the past four semesters here at AU, I have had in every class at least one person of Haitian origin. It's unfortunate that all of this knowledge does not go back home.\"\nUnfortunate, but maybe not inevitable. Through his work, Aubourg is providing his Haitian students - his countrymen - with one more reason to stay.\nCenter for Public Finance Research (CPFR)"

August 6, 2013\nSEC, DOJ Sue BofA Over Mortgage-Backed Securities The two lawsuits entail about $850 million of RMBS sales in 2008 that led to losses of $120 million, regulators estimate\nOn Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Bank of America (BAC) and two subsidiaries with defrauding investors who bought residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) by failing to disclose key risks and misrepresenting facts about the underlying mortgages.\nThe SEC alleges that BofA did not tell investors that more than 70% of the mortgages backing the offering - called BOAMS 2008-A - came from the bank's \"wholesale\" channel of mortgage brokers unaffiliated with Bank of America entities. Furthermore, the SEC says, BofA knew the wholesale-channel loans - described by its then-CEO as \"toxic waste\" - presented greater risks of delinquencies, early defaults, underwriting defects and prepayment, yet it \"only selectively disclosed the percentage of wholesale channel loans to a limited group of institutional investors,\" regulators say, rather than disclose this material information to all investors or file the information publicly as required.\n\"In its own words, Bank of America 'shifted the risk' of loss from its own books to unsuspecting investors and then ignored its responsibility to make a full and accurate disclosure to all investors equally,\" said George S. Canellos, co-director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, in a press release. \"This is one in a long line of RMBS-related enforcement actions brought by the SEC to hold entities accountable for wrongdoing connected to the financial crisis.\"\nAlso on Tuesday, the Department of Justice says it will take parallel civil action against BofA for violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 involving $850 million of RMBS sales in 2008, which have resulted in estimated losses of roughly $120 million.\nThe SEC and DOJ charges do not affect BofA's wealth-management operations, which include Merrill Lynch, according to Bank of America and concern institutional investors. \"This is the RMBS Working Group's most recent legal enforcement targeting misconduct in the RMBS market, but it will not be our last,\" said Associate Attorney General Tony West, in a press release. \"Combating financial fraud is a top priority for the Department of Justice. By filing this lawsuit today, we reaffirm an important principle - that everyone must play by the same set of rules, and no institution is too big or too powerful to escape appropriate enforcement.\"\nOn its behalf, BofA explained in a statement that the prime mortgages were sold to \"sophisticated investors who had ample access to the underlying data, and we will demonstrate that. The loans in this pool performed better than loans with similar characteristics originated and securitized at the same time by other financial institutions.\"\nIn addition, the bank says it is \"not responsible for the housing market collapse,\" which led to unprecedented rates of mortgage-loans defaults and sharp declines in the value of the underlying securities.\nAccording to the SEC's complaint, a disproportionate concentration of high-risk wholesale loans and the inclusion of a material number of loans that did not comply with internal underwriting guidelines led to a 8.05% cumulative net loss rate for the RMBS through June 2013 - \"the greatest loss rate of any comparable ... securitization.\" This led to losses of nearly $70 million with anticipated future losses of some $50 million, the regulators note.\nDivision of Enforcement\nGeorge S.

Byblos Bank chairman Fran\u00e7ois Bassil expects the combined net profits of the Lebanese banking [2] sector to plunge by 5-10 percent at the end of 2012 due to political bickering and the volatile situation in neighboring Syria. \"Our growth in assets and deposits will be close to 8 percent this year ... close to last year's figures. However, the net profits for all commercial banks may fall by 5-8 percent if the economy and political situation continue to deteriorate,\" Bassil told The Daily Star Monday in an interview at the bank's headquarters.\nSome leading banks have actually seen their profits fall in the first quarter of this year despite adopting measures which attempt to contain the negative impact of both the economic slowdown and raging war in Syria. [3]\nMost of these banks have increased their provisions for non-performing loans since the crisis in Syria started 16-months ago. This measure, which is seen as essential, has apparently affected the profitability of most of the leading banks. But the profits of the leading banks are still considered relatively high in spite of the fragile situation the country is experiencing.\nThe latest data on Lebanon's banking sector [4] revealed that the total assets held by Lebanese commercial banks reached $144.86 billion at the end of May 2012, up by 8.07 percent from May 2011 and 3.05 percent from December 2011\nBanks claim to have wide cash surpluses, arguing that all they need is stability and more investment opportunities to diversify their revenues.\nBassil also expressed his deep indignation at the government's impotence and inability to address the crucial economic issues facing the sector. \"I don't feel the presence of the government. The constant bickering between the ministers has driven the national economy to the brink of disaster,\" he said. Bassil said that Lebanese banks can easily use portions of their excess cash to finance some of the vital government projects.\n\"Investment opportunities abroad are scarce these days as a result of the economic recession in some European countries. It is natural we support the idea of investing part of our portfolio in government projects as part of the Public-Private-Partnership,\" he said. Bassil painted a bleak picture of the economy in general.\n\"Some agencies and the International Monetary Fund project a growth of 3 percent at the end of 2012. Frankly speaking I doubt we will have 1 percent growth if the situation does not improve,\" Bassil warned. He admitted that the deteriorating situation in Syria had proven devastating to both the Lebanese economy and tourism sector.\n\"What makes matters worse is the indifference of the government, which has failed to take any steps to contain the consequences of the deteriorating situation in Syria,\" Bassil said.\nThe recent campaign by the U.S. group United Against Nuclear Iran to discredit the reputation of the Lebanese banking sector was at the heart of comments made by Bassil, who vehemently dismissed all accusations of money laundering and terrorist funding.\n\"All of the U.S. officials who we met have praised the measures taken by Lebanese banks to curb any attempt to deal with Iranian and Syrian banks. We are complying strictly with all U.N. Security Council resolutions,\" Bassil said. He stressed that Lebanese banks never received Iranian funds.\n\"Since the liberalization of the Lebanese economy after the French withdrew from Lebanon, we have never received or dealt with Iranian banks or financial institutions. All of the foreign banks in Lebanon abide by the laws of the Central Bank,\" he said.\nSome U.S. agencies have questioned how a small country like Lebanon with its relatively low GDP can have high assets and deposits in its banking system, and have suggested that most of these funds have been generated through illicit means.\n\"All of these reports are pure fabrication. Most of the deposits are from Lebanese expatriates in Africa, South America, Europe and oil-rich Arab countries,\" Bassil explained.\nThe former president of the Association of Banks in Lebanon also denied allegations that U.S. officials threatened to take punitive measures against Lebanese banks. \"These reports are false and unfounded. U.S. officials want us to maintain our vigilance and prevent any attempt to launder money.\" He pointed out that Lebanese expatriates outnumber the residing Lebanese citizens.\nRemittances and capital inflows, which amount to more than $8 billion a year, have buttressed the Lebanese economy and helped improve the balance of payments.\nBassil maintained that all Lebanese banks operating in Syria are refraining from granting new loans to Syrian citizens or accepting any new transactions.\n\"Naturally, deposits in Lebanese banks in Syria have shrunk since the crisis started. But we have no intention to exit this market - the country will eventually return to normal. Syria is still a promising market for Lebanese banks and for this reason we have no plans to leave it,\" he said.\n[5] Copyright \u00a9 2012, The Daily Star. All rights reserved.

Sweeney (D-West Deptford) had proposed to accomplish those goals through a constitutional amendment  -  which would evade the looming veto pen of Gov. Chris Christie, but face even more intense opposition from the state's business associations  -  he recently agreed to support the Assembly-approved measure that will be considered in the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee today.Kathleen A. Davis, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey, said the legislative provision to automatically increase the minimum wage every year according to inflation is \"still very troublesome to us,\" though she said \"having the opportunity to have our thoughts and concerns weighed is certainly a better way to go than a 'yes or no' question going to voters to make this issue part of our constitution.\"\"This is a very complex and far-reaching issue, so I think that going through the legislative process provides more opportunities for input from the business community in terms of what this increase will mean to them, especially to small businesses,\" Davis said.Davis said a January 2012 survey of the chamber's members found the top reason why businesses oppose the measure is the impact it would have on consumer prices, as any increase in labor costs would get passed on to customers and make a company's products and services less competitive.Some business groups have noted that the shore's tourism industry was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy, and argue the minimum wage increase would amount do a double blow, but Samia Bahsoun, a steering committee member at the small business group Main Street Alliance, made the opposite point, saying the extra income in low-wage workers' pockets would translate into new spending and help the economy.\"So the ripple effect of just this additional dollar... would tremendously impact small biz, and we know that we all need it here on the Jersey Shore,\" she said.According to the New Jersey Time to Care Coalition, which supports the bill sponsored by Assembly Speaker Sheila Y. Oliver (D-East Orange) and other Assembly members, if the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would currently be more than $10 an hour, compared to the $7.25 an hour rate it is today.Oliver said lawmakers are capable of helping businesses and low-wage workers at the same time.\"We are going to be there for those business owners,\" she said. \"We are going to be promulgating a variety of initiatives to help support them, and I do not believe that in order to support businesses that have been ravaged by Sandy it means that we cannot elevate the minimum wage for low income workers in this state.\"Oliver challenged her fellow legislators to pass the bill, noting that the state has in recent years provided numerous incentives to businesses and arguing \"it is time to turn attention to the people that make business prosperous, and it is the people that work within those businesses.\"To voice its concerns to the Legislature, the chamber has joined a coalition of 11 state business groups led by the New Jersey Business & Industry Association to testify against the bill at today's Senate committee hearing.In her prepared testimony, Stefanie Riehl, NJBIA assistant vice president, said the coalition is especially concerned about the proposed minimum wage increase after witnessing Hurricane Sandy's impact on businesses, and hearing that \"many of our employers are still focusing on making payroll and how they can make their workers whole following the losses they've incurred.\"\"Thousands of employers have a long and difficult task in rebuilding their businesses and getting people back to work. Just getting back to where they were is going to be hard enough,\" Riehl said in a statement Friday. \"Lawmakers shouldn't raise the bar even higher.\"Contributing: Jared Kaltwasser"

        "webpage": "Don't Wipe Out Flood Insurance Reform | Commentary\nBy Charles M. Chamness\nNext week the House plans to take up its bill to delay much-needed National Flood Insurance Program reforms adopted less than two years ago, with lawmakers from the Gulf region and the Eastern seaboard leading the charge.\nDoing so would put the responsibility for paying for flood insurance back on the taxpayers. It would also deny the reality of how much, and how quickly, the NFIP needs fixing, a reality that Congress recognized only 18 months ago yet seems determined to forget.\nSince its creation in 1968, NFIP premiums have been kept far lower than they should be, meaning that many of those living in high-risk areas aren't paying rates to match the risk they face from flooding, and that the taxpayers have been making up the difference to the tune of more than $24 billion. Legislation to fix the program was passed in 2012 with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. In a rare display of common sense and courage, Congress overhauled the program and allowed it to charge rates based on a property's risk of flooding. By phasing out subsidies for primary residences, the NFIP could begin to move toward financial soundness. Less than 5 percent of American households have flood insurance, and less than 1 percent were paying the artificially low rates that left the program unable to meet its obligations and forced to borrow billions from the taxpayers. As those rates have begun to reflect the risk of flooding, however, those less-than-1-percenters have not been shy about letting their members of Congress know they are not happy.\nIn response, lawmakers have acted as you might expect in an election year. The U.S. Senate has already reversed itself, passing legislation to effectively undo the reforms and put the NFIP in further need of taxpayer dollars. The House is voting on legislation that similarly puts good short-term politics ahead of good long-term policy. While promising cheap flood insurance may help in November, the effect of continuing to give less than 1 percent of the country's homeowners (0.05 percent, actually) subsidized flood insurance at everyone else's expense may ultimately cost more votes than it wins. To be fair, some legitimate problems have complicated implementation of the reforms, particularly in the resale of homes or properties of low-income individuals now included in floodplains on newly revised flood maps. But the legislation passed by the Senate doesn't focus narrowly on these issues. It simply delays the reforms for everyone, kicking yet another can down the road.\nAnd those who benefit most from the continued subsidy are likely those who need help the least. Two-thirds of subsidized policies are for properties in counties where home values are among the top one-third in the nation (while less than 1 in 10 of subsidized polices are for properties in counties in the bottom third of home values). According to the R Street Institute, homeowners in those wealthy counties file nearly four times as many claims and received $1 billion more in claims payments than the poorest counties between 1998 and 2008.\nRolling back the reforms passed in 2012, as the House seems intent on doing, is not a solution. The proposed legislation attempts to make up for some of the lost revenue, but the long-term viability of the program will remain very much at risk from future storms. There are reasonable ways to solve the problems that have brought Congress back to this issue. Expanding the phase-in of reforms to include homes sold over the past year and special assistance on a means-tested basis are but two approaches worthy of consideration.\nCharles M. Chamness is president and CEO of the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies."

        "webpage": "Without Key Jobs Data, Markets And Economists Left Guessing By Marilyn Geewax\nOct 3, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email JPMorgan Chase trader Frederick Reimer works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The government's monthly jobs numbers won't be released as scheduled Friday, leaving financial markets without key data to evaluate the economy.\nBrendan McDermid\nOriginally published on October 3, 2013 1:32 pm Stock investors and business journalists unite each month for one shared, suspenseful moment  -  the 8:30 a.m. release of the Labor Department's employment report. The unveiling of the report  -  so rich with data on job creation, unemployment, wages and hours  -  can be counted upon to set off a tsunami of tweets. Economists jump in with instant analysis and politicians fire off press releases with reactions. That market-moving report was due this Friday. But it won't come out  -  leaving Federal Reserve policymakers, investors and job seekers scratching their heads about labor-market conditions. Because of the federal government's partial shutdown, the Labor Department is not releasing its most closely watched report. \"An alternative release date has not been scheduled,\" the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists will have to try reading tea leaves  -  or at least examining less-reliable private reports  -  to get a sense of what the job market did in September. \"You hate to have data delayed because that creates uncertainty,\" said John Canally, an economist for LPL Financial, a Boston-based financial services firm. Not getting that jobs report \"deprives the markets of important information,\" he said. Among economists, the monthly jobs report, compiled by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is considered a \"gold standard\" report. It has a long history and a broad reach, including information from both employers and members of households. On Thursday, economists did get one government-generated report with the release of data on initial claims for unemployment compensation. The first-time claims increased by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 308,000 last week. Economists had forecast 314,000 new claims would be filed, so the report suggests the job market was a bit stronger than most people had thought. That report, based on state data, may continue to be published throughout the shutdown. Unfortunately for economists, other reports from the BLS and Commerce Department will go dark for the duration. For example, on Tuesday, Commerce failed to issue its usual construction spending report. Next Tuesday, it will not be able to release its scheduled international trade report unless the shutdown ends. The loss of such reports is particularly damaging to investor confidence at a time when the Fed is considering a major policy shift, according to Robbert van Batenburg, market strategist for Newedge, a global financial services firm based in Paris. For years, the Fed has been holding down interest rates, waiting for signs that the economy is improving. The time for that policy shift is just about now. But exactly when the Fed will change direction will depend on the strength of the job market. Investors are aware of \"the data dependency of the Fed, and the Fed leans toward using government data,\" van Batenburg said. Translation: When we all know the Fed is using BLS data to set policy, then we're all on the same page. If the Fed starts relying on information from less reliable sources, then things will get even more confusing for investors trying to guess what Fed policymakers are thinking. Even worse, the loss of key government reports means Fed officials are more likely to make a bad call about the direction of the economy, he said. \"The more data you have across the spectrum, the better your decision-making,\" he said. Still, if the shutdown lasts only a short while, investors and economists will be able to make their forecasts with the help of private reports. The monthly ADP National Employment Trends report, for example, offers an assessment of private-sector jobs issued by the payroll-processing company. On Wednesday, ADP said the private sector created 166,000 jobs in September. That report is not as complete as the BLS monthly snapshot, which counts government workers such as firefighters and teachers, but it's becoming widely followed as a supplement to the government data. On Thursday, another closely watched private report was issued. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas said companies announced plans for 40,289 layoffs in September. That's 20 percent fewer job cuts than in August. Other reports that carry weight among economists include: Standard and Poor's Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Home Price Index; Markit's Purchasing Purchasing Managers' Index; the International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs Retail Chain Stores Sales Index; the Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing ISM index and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index. \"In the short term, you can live without the government reports,\" van Batenburg said. But over time, the loss of the best data will erode confidence that the Fed policymakers and investment advisers are making informed judgments. \"It all depends on the duration of the shutdown,\" he said.Copyright 2013 NPR.

        "webpage": "TOPICS 401(k)\nBond Fund\nCommodity Investments\nEquity Investing\nICI Global\nOperations and Technology\nThe SEC Should Protect All Investors from Misleading Hedge Fund Ads\nBy Robert C. Grohowski May 31, 2012\nIn early April, President Obama signed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, into law. Most of the JOBS Act has little to do with the fund industry, but one provision - the repeal of a long-standing ban on advertising private securities offerings - has the potential to open the door to misleading ads for private funds, such as hedge funds. To be clear, these won't be mutual fund advertisements; nonetheless, we are concerned that misleading ads for any fund will harm investors, cause confusion, and damage the reputation of all funds in the marketplace.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can address these concerns as it proceeds with its rulemaking to implement the JOBS Act. In a recent comment letter, ICI offered a range of recommendations on how the SEC can leverage its own experience with mutual fund advertising to protect investors and the marketplace from misleading hedge fund ads.\nBackground: Private Offerings and Advertising\nMany companies raise money through private offerings of securities, which escape most of the regulatory burdens that come with public offerings.\nTo make a private offering, companies can follow Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. Rule 506 under that regulation allows a company to raise an unlimited amount of money. Historically, the company could only raise money this way if it did not \"generally solicit\" or \"generally advertise\" the securities being offered. And it is precisely that condition that the JOBS Act repealed, provided that all sales are made to accredited investors.\nWhy ICI Cares\nAccording to data recently published by the Commission's Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation, private investment funds such as hedge funds are the most common type of issuer that relies on Rule 506 to conduct private offerings.\nIt is fair to assume that private funds will make use of the new ability to advertise private offerings under Rule 506. And while sales may be limited to accredited investors, these ads will come before sophisticated and unsophisticated, accredited and nonaccredited investors alike.\nA misleading advertisement for a private fund thus has the potential to harm not only the accredited investors that ultimately might invest in the fund, but also to cause confusion among fund investors of all types, and damage the reputation of all funds in the marketplace.\nMoreover, the standards for \"accredited\" status are shockingly low. The income and net worth tests were set 30 years ago, and have substantially eroded over time. As a result, many of the accredited investors targeted by these ads lack the sophistication necessary to fend for themselves and deserve the SEC's protection.\nPerformance Advertising: A Key Area of Concern\nWe make a number of recommendations in our letter, but one among them is particularly important to explain. We recommend that, at least initially, the SEC ban performance advertising by private funds.\nAnyone who has seen an ad for a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund knows that these advertisements often mention fund performance, expressed in percentage terms. A number of rules - the culmination of 60 years of practical regulatory experience - are in place to ensure that the numbers presented are calculated based on highly specific, standardized methodologies, so investors can make accurate comparisons among funds.\nBy contrast, no such rules exist for private funds. They are not required to use any standardized methodologies for calculating performance, and they often invest in securities that are relatively illiquid and difficult to value. As a result, a number of academics have expressed significant questions about the veracity of private fund performance figures. Not surprisingly, the SEC also is keenly focused on fraudulent performance claims by private funds, as is evident from the numerous enforcement actions on that front.\nThe SEC could develop a detailed rule that would promote comparability of private fund performance figures through the imposition of standardized methodologies, like the one that mutual funds follow. But the JOBS Act rulemaking deadlines are tight, and there is no question that such a rulemaking would be difficult. If the SEC chooses not to tackle that task, it should simply prohibit private funds from using performance figures in ads. There is no other way to protect fund investors of all types from being misled by eye-catching claims of performance.\nRobert C. Grohowski is a Senior Counsel at ICI.\nTOPICS: Fund Regulation"

        "webpage": "The West needs a new progressive political economy - Taipei Times\nSat, Mar 08, 2014 - Page 9 News List\nThe West needs a new progressive political economy\nBy David Sainsbury In an article in Foreign Affairs entitled \"The Future of History,\" Francis Fukuyama pointed out that, despite widespread anger at Wall Street bailouts, there has been no great upsurge of support for left-wing political parties. Fukuyama attributed this  -  rightly, I believe  -  to a failure of ideas.The 2008 financial crash revealed major flaws in the neoliberal view of capitalism and an objective view of the past 35 years shows that the neoliberal model has not performed well relative to the previous 30 years in terms of economic growth, financial stability and social justice. However, a credible progressive alternative has yet to take shape.What should be the main outlines of such an alternative?First, a progressive political economy must be based on a firm belief in capitalism  -  that is, on an economic system in which most of the assets are privately owned, and markets largely guide production and distribute income.However, it must also incorporate three defining progressive beliefs  -  the crucial role of institutions; the need for state involvement in their design in order to resolve conflicting interests and provide public goods; and social justice, defined as fairness, as an important measure of a country's economic performance.It was a great mistake of neoclassical economists not to see that capitalism is a socioeconomic system and that institutions are an essential part of it. The recent financial crisis was made far worse by profound institutional failures, such as the high level of leverage that banks were permitted to have.Empirical research has shown that four sets of institutions have a major impact on the performance of firms and, therefore, on a country's economic growth.\nThese include the institutions underpinning its financial and labor markets, its corporate-governance arrangements, its education and training system, and its national system of innovation (the network of public and private institutions that initiate and diffuse new technologies).The second defining belief of progressive thinking is that institutions do not evolve spontaneously, as neoliberals believe.The state must be involved in their design and reform. In the case of institutions underpinning labor and financial markets, as well as corporate governance, the state must mediate conflicting interests.Likewise, a country's education and training system, and its national system of innovation, are largely public goods, which have to be provided by the state.It should be clear that the role for the state that I have been describing is an enabling or market-supporting one.It is not the command-and-control role promoted by traditional socialists or the minimalist role beloved by neoliberals.The third defining belief of progressive thinking rejects the neoliberal view that a country's economic performance should be assessed solely in terms of GDP growth and freedom. If one is concerned with a society's well-being, it is not possible to argue that a rich country in which the top 1 percent hold most of the wealth is performing better than a slightly less wealthy country in which prosperity is more widely shared.Moreover, fairness is a better measure of social justice than equality. This is because it is difficult to devise practical and effective policies to achieve equality in a market economy."

        "webpage": "Closing the UK Competitiveness Gap\n\nClosing the UK Competitiveness Gap\n\nArticle excerpt\n\nIntroduction\n\nImproving national competitiveness has become a key policy theme of the 1990s. The UK Government has published two White Papers on competitiveness (HMSO, 1994 and 1995) and is committed to producing a third in 1996. The US, Germany, Canada, Australia and Spain are some of the other countries that have published similar reports. The European Commission has followed up its 1993 White Paper entitled Growth, Competitiveness, Employment with the establishment of a high level Competitiveness Advisory Group.\n\nYet the concept of national competitiveness has been attacked by many leading economists. Krugman (1994), for example, has said that 'competitiveness is a meaningless word when applied to national economies. And the obsession with competitiveness is both wrong and dangerous'.\n\nTwo main criticisms have been made of competitiveness as a guide to policy. The first is that the competitiveness of a nation (rather than that of a firm) has no agreed meaning in economic theory and can therefore mean different things to different people. Corden (1994) identifies three different measures of national competitiveness in common usage: sectoral competitiveness; relative cost competitiveness (the real exchange rate); and productivity.\n\nThe UK White Papers, like Porter (1990) and the US Competitiveness Policy Council (1993), use the third of Corden's definitions by viewing competitiveness as the ability to raise living standards. Competitiveness is defined as:\n\n'the degree to which a country can, under free and fair market conditions, produce goods and services which meet the test of international markets, while simultaneously maintaining and expanding the real incomes of its people over the long term'. (HMSO, 1994 and 1995)\n\nThis definition focuses on productivity rather than on the real exchange rate. A country with low productivity levels may still be competitive in relative cost terms provided that its (nominal) exchange rate is low enough, but its living standards will generally be lower than those in countries with higher productivity levels.\n\nThe second criticism is that using competitiveness as a synonym for raising productivity in the domestic production of goods and services may encourage protectionism by giving a misplaced emphasis to countries as rivals, and to the role of trade and the balance of payments in economic performance. The UK White Papers recognise this danger and stress that trade is not a zero sum game and that living standards are determined by productivity growth and not by trade performance.\n\nIn spite of these criticisms, a long-term concept of competitiveness remains of use to policy makers for two reasons. First, because it emphasises international bench-marking. The key issue for policy is whether productivity in the UK is below its own potential, given its national preferences and technological capabilities, rather than the potential of other nations. However, there is much we can learn about economic policy and institutional arrangements from countries with faster (or indeed, slower) productivity growth than ourselves. Second, it implies that the search for improved economic performance is never ending. That is why the White Papers focus on international comparisons of performance over the long term.\n\nThe Government's Competitiveness Analysis\n\nLiving standards are generally approximated by real output per head measured at purchasing power parities. If output per head grows then the real incomes of the population can increase. If output per head grows faster in one country than in others, the real incomes of its population will increase more rapidly. Raising output per head is therefore a central objective of Government policy. In 1994 the UK's output per head was the 16th highest in the OECD. However, only Luxembourg, the US and Switzerland exceeded UK GDP per head by more than 20 per cent [ILLUSTRATION FOR CHART 1 OMITTED].\n\nProductivity is a key determinant of living standards in the long run. ..."

        "webpage": "When the right to sue goes away\nDavid LazarusContact Reporter\nFederal regulators are taking a closer look at those restrictive contract provisions that force consumers to arbitrate disputes  -  barring them from suing a company individually or joining a class-action lawsuit.And it doesn't look as if officials are buying into the business world's claim that such provisions are in consumers' best interest.\n\"If you were to look in your wallet right now, the chances are high that one or more of your credit cards, debit cards or prepaid cards would be subject to a pre-dispute arbitration clause,\" Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said during a recent appearance in Dallas.\"The terms are not subject to negotiation,\" he pointed out. \"Like the other terms of most consumer financial products, they are essentially 'take it or leave it' propositions.\"\nMany businesses prefer arbitration because settlements are limited and because professional arbitrators, whose fees are typically paid by the company in a dispute, tend not to bite the hand that feeds.A 2007 report by Public Citizen found that over a four-year period, arbitrators sided with credit card companies 94% of the time in disputes with California consumers.Consumer advocates have long argued that it's unfair to deny people the right to sue or to band together in class actions, which are often the only effective way of addressing relatively small claims.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision in 2011 that businesses  -  phone companies, credit card issuers, cable operators  -  can include arbitration clauses in their service contracts. The ruling specifically involved AT&T but applied to all companies in all industries.That would seem to be the end of the story. But the same financial reform law that created the bureau in 2010 gave it the authority to \"prohibit or impose conditions or limitations on the use\" of arbitration clauses for credit cards, checking accounts and other financial contracts.That's what regulators are finally getting around to considering.Cordray said a preliminary investigation revealed that \"few consumers use arbitration at all, at least when compared to the number of consumers involved in lawsuits and class actions.\"One reason for this, he suggested, is that many consumers might not find it worth their time to arbitrate relatively small sums of money. He said that \"there are almost no disputes over amounts less than $1,000.\"Out of tens of millions of people subject to arbitration clauses in contracts for financial services, only 900 used arbitration from 2010 to 2012, investigators found.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a 58-page letter to the bureau this month that officials seem to have already made up their minds that arbitration is bad for consumers.It said that \"prohibiting or regulating arbitration will harm consumers more than it would benefit them.\"\"Arbitration is at least as likely, and often more likely, than litigation in court to result in positive outcomes for consumers,\" the chamber said.If that were true, though, this wouldn't be an issue. The stats reported by the bureau indicate otherwise. I certainly haven't met many people who have reported satisfaction with the arbitration process.\"Very few consumers go to arbitration,\" said Christine Hines, consumer and civil justice counsel for the advocacy group Public Citizen. \"Consumers prefer to have their day in court.\"I wouldn't be surprised if regulators reached the same conclusion.Workplace arbitrationEven though consumers may soon get a break on unfair arbitration clauses, many company workers won't.This month a federal appeals court overturned a National Labor Relations Board decision that had barred employers from requiring arbitration agreements that prohibit class-action suits or collective claims over pay and hours.The case centered on a Texas home builder, D.R. Horton Inc., that made employees sign such contracts. More than 40 business groups submitted legal briefs supporting Horton's position.The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the National Labor Relations Board went too far when it ruled last year that Horton's workers had the right to sue if they wanted.\"The use of class-action procedures is not a substantive right,\" Judge Leslie Southwick wrote this month for the three-judge panel.\"This is an enormous victory for employers as they attempt to prevent the ongoing onslaught of class-action lawsuits,\" said Ron Chapman, the lead attorney for Horton.And never mind why those lawsuits were filed by employees in the first place.David Lazarus' column runs Tuesdays and Fridays.

(October 2013)\nA bilateral investment treaty (BIT) is an agreement establishing the terms and conditions for private investment by nationals and companies of one state in another state. This type of investment is called foreign direct investment (FDI). BITs are established through trade pacts. A nineteenth-century forerunner of the BIT is the friendship, commerce, and navigation treaty (FCN).[1]\nMost BITs grant investments made by an investor of one Contracting State in the territory of the other a number of guarantees, which typically include fair and equitable treatment, protection from expropriation, free transfer of means and full protection and security. The distinctive feature of many BITs is that they allow for an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, whereby an investor whose rights under the BIT have been violated could have recourse to international arbitration, often under the auspices of the ICSID (International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes), rather than suing the host State in its own courts.[2]\nThe world's first BIT was signed on November 25, 1959 between Pakistan and Germany.[3] There are currently more than 2500 BITs in force, involving most countries in the world.[4] Influential capital exporting states[citation needed] usually negotiate BITs on the basis of their own \"model\" texts (such as the US model BIT).[5]\n2 BITs involving the U.S.\nNGOs have spoken against the use of BITs, stating that they are mostly designed to protect the foreign investors and do not take into account obligations and standards to protect the environment, labour rights, social provisions or natural resources.

        "webpage": "Olli REHN\nVice-President of the European Commission and member of the Commission responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro\nRemarks by Vice-President Olli Rehn at the Eurogroup press conference\nI would like to make two points this evening.\nFirst, on Ireland and Spain. We are now two months from the end of the Irish programme and three months from the end of the Spanish financial sector programme. Both programmes are on track for a successful conclusion. The conditional financial support has helped to deliver an economic turnaround in the two countries concerned. Ireland has posted positive growth every year since the beginning of the programme. Exports have remained resilient and there are signs that domestic demand is picking up. In Spain, exports have reached record levels and bold structural reforms are helping to transform the country's competitiveness. In both cases, unemployment has begun to fall in recent months, although it still remains much too high.\nIn the coming weeks, the Central Bank of Ireland will complete its balance sheet assessment and the Bank of Spain will carry out its forward-looking exercise to analyse the resilience of the banking sector in these two countries. Without prejudging the outcome of these exercises, we can say that both countries have a very good chance of successfully concluding their programmes in a sustainable manner. The second point I wish to make is in relation to the construction of a Banking Union. The guiding principles behind our approach to bank restructuring and resolution are that taxpayers should be protected and financial stability be maintained. In this context, there is a clear pecking order to be followed in case next year's balance sheet assessments reveal capital holes. The bill should be footed first via private solutions and internal resources, in other words via shareholders and junior creditors. Only then can there be recourse to public backstops, first at the national and if needed, finally at the European level, in line with the Spanish model. Where state support is necessary, the new state aid rules in force since 1 August will apply. Last week, I wrote to Finance Ministers of the EU to clarify the treatment of capital injections under EU fiscal rules. I explained that these are normally considered as \"relevant factors for financial stability\" and/or as so-called one-off, or temporary, measures. This means they are not included in the structural balance and thus do not count against the Member State in the context of the Excessive Deficit Procedure. As such, our fiscal rules create no disincentive to effective public backstops, even if these could only be needed as a last resort, when other options are exhausted.\nSo it is, indeed, essential that we maintain the momentum for the completion of the Banking Union. This means, in particular, working constructively to agree rules for the Single Resolution Mechanism, on the basis of the Commission's legislative proposal. This was, in fact, a key messages delivered by our international partners at the IMF annual meetings in Washington this past weekend, and it is a message with which the Commission fully agrees. Finally, let me conclude by congratulating Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and the Netherlands for being able to agree on difficult but necessary consolidation measures a few days ago, which will help ensure the sustainability of its public finances. This was, in a nutshell, a victory for responsibility over brinkmanship and with this in mind one can say that it is high time for US politicians to go Dutch. We urgently need to see a similar victory for responsibility in Washington in order not to inflict serious damage on the world economy and jeopardise the nascent recovery underway now in Europe. Thank you."

Carl Levin ,\nSave | Post a comment | WASHINGTON - The Senate has taken an important step toward ensuring that middle-class families do not face a tax increase at the end of this year, and in the process, has dealt a blow to a failed policy that emphasized tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans as the cure for our economy. The Senate voted to approve legislation to prevent a tax increase on taxpayers making $250,000 a year or less. Some of my Senate colleagues had opposed this legislation, saying they would prevent it from coming to a vote unless we included the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers, those making more than $250,000. In the end, those senators ended their obstruction. The Senate rejected a plan that would have continued tax cuts for the wealthy and approved the bill I supported, to prevent an end-of-the-year tax increase on middle-class families. Article Photos\nSen. Carl Levin\nThis was important, first of all, because middle-class Americans are already struggling with the after-effects of the worst recession in decades. Unemployment is still too high, workers have seen little increase in wages, housing values remain depressed. Preserving those middle-class tax cuts is important to continuing the economic recovery. But this vote also was important because it represents the first break with what has been a rigid adherence by some of my colleagues to tax cuts for the wealthy as the supreme goal of public policy. Supporters of this policy have demonstrated a willingness to risk government shutdowns, to risk grave economic damage, and to risk rising taxes on the vast majority of Americans in pursuit of their highest of priority: lower taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of us. That policy has already proved a failure. Income for the typical American family peaked in 2000 not coincidentally, just before the tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy mania reached its zenith. A June study by the Federal Reserve found that the average middle-class family's net worth had fallen by 40 percent from 2007 to 2010. And in 2010, the bottom 99 percent of income earners reaped just 7 percent of total income growth, while 93 percent of all growth flowed to the top 1 percent. Now, perhaps this vast accumulation of wealth would arguably be acceptable if it had resulted in faster economic growth that produced new jobs and helped average Americans prosper. Indeed, since the time of President Reagan, we have been told that the rising tide lifting up the wealthy would lift all boats, that the benefits would trickle down to all Americans. But policies that are more and more generous to the wealthiest have failed to spark economic growth or create the jobs we need. More tax cuts for the wealthy coincided with the slowest rate of job growth in recent American history. Economic growth, even before the financial crisis nearly sent our economy into depression, was woefully short of historic standards. And, despite promises that tax cuts for the wealthy would somehow add to federal revenue, these tax cuts have raised the federal deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. Ending them will reduce the deficit by nearly $1 trillion over 10 years. So this policy of tax cuts for the wealthy has failed as fiscal policy, adding to our deficit. It has failed as economic policy, coinciding with weak growth in economic output and job creation. And it has failed a vital test of public policy in a democratic society it failed the fairness test, facilitating massive accumulations of wealth for a fortunate few while most Americans have struggled to tread water. So, I'm pleased that the Senate voted to allow middle-class families to keep a few of their hard-earned dollars. Our legislation now goes to the House of Representatives, and I hope our colleagues there will soon join us in preserving middle-class tax relief. - - - Carl Levin is the senior U.S. senator from Michigan.

Barclays said this month that it will present a plan on May 8 to deliver \"improved and sustainable returns and growth.\"\nWhile Rudloff was at Barclays, where he spent 16 years as chairman of the investment bank, the firm morphed into a fixed-income specialist, having sold its equities business in 1997. It returned to underwriting and trading stocks in 2008 with the purchase of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s North American operations out of bankruptcy.\n\"Investment banks are two-thirds down the road of adapting, and the U.S. banks are further down the road because they've been faster at adjusting,\" Rudloff said. \"The No. 1 winners will be the American firms and the Europeans which are able figure out their roles.\"\nUkraine Tensions\nRudloff started as a trainee at Credit Suisse in Geneva in 1965.

While the U.S. financial sector has mostly delevered and the U.S. economy is \"on a sounder footing than I expected,\" he argued in a response to a question from Commonwealth chief investment officer and fellow CFA Brad McMillan that \"Europe never fixed its banks.\" That Achilles heel can be pricked if depositors start withdrawing from Greek, Italian and Spanish banks, he said.\nHowever, Koesterich suggested that there were areas of Europe that provide opportunities for investors, notably in Norway and Sweden. And while valuations among U.S. companies have increased to the point that many are trading at a premium to their book value, especially smaller-cap stocks, the \"valuation cushion\" might be stronger internationally, especially in smaller developed countries like Singapore and Switzerland.\nReturning to domestic matters, in answer to an advisor's query on whether the markets are currently experiencing a \"great rotation\" back into equities, Koesterich was dubious. \"It's not happening,\" he said, arguing that fund flows into equities are not coming from bonds, but rather that investors are moving out of cash accounts back into equities, using proceeds from sales of appreciated equities last year.\nAs for U.S. economic growth, Koesterich said that while debt as a percentage of GDP has stabilized, \"total nonfinancial U.S. debt\" stands at 251% of GDP. \"When debt gets this high,\" Koesterich warned, \"it has an effect on growth.\"\nMcMillan began the session, which took place during the 10th annual Chairman's Retreat for top-producing Commonwealth Financial reps, by asking if Washington was still the \"financial capital of the world.\"\nKoesterich's response: \"We've spent too much time worrying about Washington,\" and that at least in the short term, \"we've dodged most of the issues\" around government debt. Longer term, he said that \"the U.S. can go on like this for another four to five years,\" spurred by quantitative easing and slow though stolid economic growth, and that the deficit \"won't start looking bad until 2017.\" By then, he warned, the increasing numbers of retiring baby boomers may contribute to a \"crowding-out factor,\" when the government's need for financing may bump up against consumers' borrowing needs.\nRuss Koesterich\nBrad McMillan"

        "webpage": "Without Key Jobs Data, Markets And Economists Left Guessing By Marilyn Geewax\nOct 3, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email JPMorgan Chase trader Frederick Reimer works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The government's monthly jobs numbers won't be released as scheduled Friday, leaving financial markets without key data to evaluate the economy.\nBrendan McDermid\n/ Reuters/Landov\nOriginally published on October 3, 2013 12:32 pm Stock investors and business journalists unite each month for one shared, suspenseful moment  -  the 8:30 a.m. release of the Labor Department's employment report. The unveiling of the report  -  so rich with data on job creation, unemployment, wages and hours  -  can be counted upon to set off a tsunami of tweets. Economists jump in with instant analysis and politicians fire off press releases with reactions. That market-moving report was due this Friday. But it won't come out  -  leaving Federal Reserve policymakers, investors and job seekers scratching their heads about labor-market conditions. Because of the federal government's partial shutdown, the Labor Department is not releasing its most closely watched report. \"An alternative release date has not been scheduled,\" the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists will have to try reading tea leaves  -  or at least examining less-reliable private reports  -  to get a sense of what the job market did in September. \"You hate to have data delayed because that creates uncertainty,\" said John Canally, an economist for LPL Financial, a Boston-based financial services firm. Not getting that jobs report \"deprives the markets of important information,\" he said. Among economists, the monthly jobs report, compiled by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is considered a \"gold standard\" report. It has a long history and a broad reach, including information from both employers and members of households. On Thursday, economists did get one government-generated report with the release of data on initial claims for unemployment compensation. The first-time claims increased by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 308,000 last week. Economists had forecast 314,000 new claims would be filed, so the report suggests the job market was a bit stronger than most people had thought. That report, based on state data, may continue to be published throughout the shutdown. Unfortunately for economists, other reports from the BLS and Commerce Department will go dark for the duration. For example, on Tuesday, Commerce failed to issue its usual construction spending report. Next Tuesday, it will not be able to release its scheduled international trade report unless the shutdown ends. The loss of such reports is particularly damaging to investor confidence at a time when the Fed is considering a major policy shift, according to Robbert van Batenburg, market strategist for Newedge, a global financial services firm based in Paris. For years, the Fed has been holding down interest rates, waiting for signs that the economy is improving. The time for that policy shift is just about now. But exactly when the Fed will change direction will depend on the strength of the job market. Investors are aware of \"the data dependency of the Fed, and the Fed leans toward using government data,\" van Batenburg said. Translation: When we all know the Fed is using BLS data to set policy, then we're all on the same page. If the Fed starts relying on information from less reliable sources, then things will get even more confusing for investors trying to guess what Fed policymakers are thinking. Even worse, the loss of key government reports means Fed officials are more likely to make a bad call about the direction of the economy, he said. \"The more data you have across the spectrum, the better your decision-making,\" he said. Still, if the shutdown lasts only a short while, investors and economists will be able to make their forecasts with the help of private reports. The monthly ADP National Employment Trends report, for example, offers an assessment of private-sector jobs issued by the payroll-processing company. On Wednesday, ADP said the private sector created 166,000 jobs in September. That report is not as complete as the BLS monthly snapshot, which counts government workers such as firefighters and teachers, but it's becoming widely followed as a supplement to the government data. On Thursday, another closely watched private report was issued. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas said companies announced plans for 40,289 layoffs in September. That's 20 percent fewer job cuts than in August. Other reports that carry weight among economists include: Standard and Poor's Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Home Price Index; Markit's Purchasing Purchasing Managers' Index; the International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs Retail Chain Stores Sales Index; the Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing ISM index and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index. \"In the short term, you can live without the government reports,\" van Batenburg said. But over time, the loss of the best data will erode confidence that the Fed policymakers and investment advisers are making informed judgments. \"It all depends on the duration of the shutdown,\" he said.Copyright 2013 NPR.

The United States and China are now the world's largest and second largest economies.\nThe two sides also are locked in a number of trade disputes, with China being accused of unfair trade practices. Many of these issues have been referred to the World Trade Organization. Some U.S. critics also have charged China is deliberately keeping the value of its currency low in relation to other major currencies to make its exports cheaper and thus run huge trade surpluses against the United States.\nXinhua reported the two sides achieved a variety of consensuses on promoting bilateral trade and business ties, and signed two documents in support of bilateral trade cooperation.\nThe two sides agreed that strengthening China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is conducive not only to the economic growth and job creation in both countries, but also to the robust, sustainable and balanced economic growth of the world.\nWang told the conference earlier that being the largest economies, further boosting China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is of critical importance not only to the two economies but also to the global economy as a whole.\nKirk was quoted as saying the JCCT is one of the pillars of the stability in the relationship between the United States and China, while Blank said U.S.-China bilateral trade and commerce relationship has never been more important, Xinhua reported.\nIn a commentary ahead of the talks, Xinhua said: \"China and the United States deeply rely on each other for economic growth and trade, and that interdependence has generated benefits for both countries despite frictions.\n\"Politicians in both countries should heed to this fact, refrain from extracting political gains from economic and trade issues and foster, instead of disturbing, the growing business ties between the world's two largest economies.\"\nThe article said the JCCT offers a good platform for both countries to \"uphold cooperation and trust, and negotiate a timely solution to trade and economic disputes.\"\nIt reminded that despite \"a large surplus in trade with the United States, China, with its vast domestic market, is now the third largest destination for U.S. exports, only behind Canada and Mexico.\"\nIt also said attributing the trade surplus to a weak Chinese currency is \"grossly simplistic,\" asserting China's increasing productivity, a factor unrelated to exchange rates, has contributed in large part to Chinese exports growth.\nXinhua said the Chinese yuan has appreciated more than 20 percent since its currency reform in 2005, making Chinese goods in the United States costlier and American merchandise more affordable in China.\n\"Some American politicians portrayed China as a threatening economic powerhouse that covertly bends trade rules, calling for a more confrontational stance toward the Asian country on trade in Barack Obama's second term as president. Yet, neither Chinese nor American businesses can afford a trade war,\" it warned.\nChinese PM optimistic about talks\nAnnan welcomes WTO talks decision\nU.S. welcomes Chinese competition\nIran welcomes trade, aid talks with EU\nTopics: Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan, Ron Kirk, Timothy Geithner, Tom Donilon, Barack Obama Trending"

Policymakers and economists expected lawmakers would strike a last-minute deal to avert a crisis.\nThe political brinkmanship hit world stocks on Monday and pushed money into safe-haven gold and Swiss francs, ending a brief relief rally over Greece's second bailout package, although there was no sign of panic.\nBut with just eight days left before Aug. 2, when the Treasury Department has estimated it will run short of money to pay all of its bills, the worry level was rising.\n\"Those in direct charge of reserves operations must be more nervous than before, but nobody thinks Americans will choose suicide when they have known solutions,\" said a senior official at the Bank of Korea, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nFresh from pulling together a new bailout of debt-ridden Greece, Berlin also expected Washington would raise its debt limit.\n\"We have ... followed the debate in America with great interest and we continue to remain confident that a compromise can be reached,\" German government spokesman Christoph Steegmans told a news conference.\nOthers were less sanguine, and much blunter.\n\"The irony of the situation at the moment ... is that the biggest threat to the world financial system comes from a few right-wing nutters in the American Congress rather than the euro zone,\" British government minister Vince Cable said on Sunday.\nPOLITICAL NOT ECONOMIC RIFT\nAsian sources said finding a solution was primarily a matter of mustering political will rather than securing rescue funding, which can be far more complicated, as Greece's crisis has shown.\n\"They will definitely reach a compromise,\" said Xia Bin, an academic adviser to the People's Bank of China. \"Don't worry too much about it.\"\nChina is the largest foreign owner of U.S. government debt, with $1.16 trillion as of May, so a vote of confidence from Beijing carries significant weight.\nA senior Indian government official said the Obama administration and lawmakers must be well aware of the consequences for global markets of failing to reach a deal.\n\"If you look at the world markets, they are jittery though they have not nose-dived,\" the Indian official said.\nAustralian Treasurer Wayne Swan said a protracted debt ceiling debate added uncertainty to the global economy.\n\"With the global recovery and confidence still fragile, it's in everyone's interests that U.S. policymakers work towards a speedy resolution,\" Swan said in an email to Reuters.\nCongress has set the U.S. government's borrowing limit at $14.3 trillion, but the Treasury has already tapped that amount and needs more to meet its obligations. Republicans want an agreement on spending cuts before they authorize more borrowing. Democrats want to see a mix of lower spending and higher taxes.\nRatings agencies have warned that even if Congress raises the debt ceiling and averts a default, they may still strip the United States of its AAA credit rating, the highest possible, if lawmakers fail to agree on deeper long-term budget cuts.\nA lower credit rating could raise borrowing costs not only for the U.S. government but also for other countries, companies and consumers because U.S. Treasuries are the benchmark by which many loans are measured.\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking in Hong Kong, said she believed Congress would secure a debt deal and \"work with President Obama to take steps to improve our long-term fiscal outlook.\"\nWHERE TO INVEST?\nEthan Harris, co-head of global economic research at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, said he expected a temporary increase in the debt ceiling with the promise of up to $4 trillion in deficit reductions to be finalized six months later.\n\"The base case scenario can be summarized as 'appease and delay'  -  appease the rating agencies and the market with the beginnings of a large plan, but in actuality delay the crisis further into the future,\" Harris said.\nRobert Tipp, chief investment strategist at Prudential Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey, said the U.S. Treasury may have a bit of wiggle room on the Aug. 2 deadline because tax revenues had exceeded expectations. But that would buy days, not weeks.\nFor Asian policymakers, there is no alternative to investing in U.S. Treasuries. China and Japan are by far the world's biggest foreign owners with more than $2 trillion in Treasuries combined. No other market in the world is deep enough to absorb that size of investment.\nMark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management's emerging markets group, said more money might flow into Asian currencies and bonds if U.S. debt talks fail.\n\"People will see that as a safer alternative,\" said Mobius, whose group manages $50 billion. \"You are already beginning to see that trend.\" \u00a9 2014 Thomson/Reuters.

Morgan's Kelly It doesn't take a crystal ball to see that 'the biggest buyer of the worst assets in the world is the Federal Reserve,' says Kelly\nSorry, investment strategists. Nobody, not even the smartest guy in the room, can look into a crystal ball and predict the capital markets' future. The best way to understand what might happen tomorrow is to study the relevant data today, says David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds.\nBased on the available information that he's seeing right now, Kelly believes that stocks have room to rise - but so do interest rates, he said Thursday in New York at J.P. Morgan Asset Management's annual research summit.\n\"It's not about mystical vision. It's about seeing today with clarity,\" Kelly (left) told the gathering of about 150 chief investment officers as he presented highlights from JPAM's free second-quarter 2013 Guide to the Markets.\nWith that, Kelly launched into an economic outlook that pinpoints the Federal Reserve as the biggest drag on the U.S. economy. Chances are the economy could have healed itself after 2009 and the markets would have returned to normal without massive intervention, he said.\n\"The biggest buyer of the worst assets in the world is the Federal Reserve,\" he said, adding that the easy monetary policy of quantitative easing has gone past ineffectiveness to being counterproductive. The economy is recovering without stimulus and bankers are being discouraged from lending, which undermines business and consumer confidence, Kelly said.\nOverall, the federal deficit is coming down a lot, but the real credit for the U.S. economy's growth goes to consumer finances, with a rise in household net worth to $69.2 trillion in the first quarter from $67.4 trillion in the third quarter of 2007 along with a decline in household debt service, Kelly noted.\n\"There's a battle between wealth and Washington, and wealth is winning,\" Kelly said.\nHis recommendation for investors is to position their portfolios to prepare for a rise in interest rates: \"We don't know the day or hour, but we know this is going to happen.\"\nKelly suggested that investment strategists quietly head for the exits, as if they're leaving a dark and overcrowded theater. \"Make no mistake, this inflationary environment is what's most out of whack.\"\nKelly also pointed to four big trends that he sees now in the data:\nEven at new all-time highs, the stock market has room to rise. (JPAM is overweight equities, though Kelly doesn't expect to see much in the way of double-digit returns going forward.)\nLong-term investors should position portfolios for rising rates.\nDeveloped-market economics are troubled, but developing-market stocks are cheap. Emerging-market stocks should benefit from stronger growth and sounder finances.\nThe post-recovery environment should favor more balance and active management.\nThe data indicate a difficult second-quarter 2013, and the bad news is that the expansion has been so \"lousy\" that many investors have missed out on it, Kelly said. \"But the good news is that the economy will tick up in the second half of the year\" as part of a long expansion, he said, adding that there's plenty of room for more U.S. growth because \"it's hard to hurt yourself if you're jumping out of a basement window.\"\nThe popularity of the JPAM Guide to the Markets has now extended beyond the United States to include guides on Asia, Europe and Brazil. More than 140,000 printed copies of the guide are distributed around the world each quarter.\nRead Trend Spotter Rosenberg Sees Inflation Around the Corner at AdvisorOne.\nJ.P.

The report concludes that important progress has been made in the areas of fiscal consolidation, strengthening of the domestic financial sector and growth-enhancing structural reforms, as requested by the Council of Ministers (implementing Decision 2011/77/EU). This paves the way for the third instalment of \u20ac4.2 billion in European funding to Ireland in January 2012.\nSo far this year, fiscal performance has been on target and the budget deficit for 2011 as a whole is now projected to be well below the 10.6% of GDP ceiling, as required in the programme. The European Commission welcomes last week's presentation of the 2012 budget by Ireland, in particular its objective to reach the programme ceiling of no more than 8.6% next year. New medium-term caps on spending will underpin the fiscal adjustment strategy to secure a deficit of below 3% of GDP in 2015. Progress has been made on reforming the budgetary framework and Ireland plans to adopt legislation to reform the budgetary process early next year.\nRecapitalization of the banking sector has been substantively completed at a lower than expected cost to the budget, benefiting from private investor participation and burden-sharing with the holders of subordinated bank debt. Deleveraging of the banking sector is progressing as planned, despite challenging market conditions. Banks have obtained secured-term funding, reflecting improved confidence. Further progress is needed in these areas so that banks can fulfil their essential role in the economy.\nThe Irish authorities are implementing structural reforms to support job creation and growth. To help reduce unemployment, reforms to sectoral wage-setting mechanisms are being prepared, together with a more investment in training. Legislative changes have been introduced to enhance competition in the medical and legal sectors with the view to bringing down costs. The long-term cost of public service pensions is also being reduced. Economic growth has returned in 2011, after three years of contraction. While Ireland's domestic economy is still re-adjusting, the export sector is seeing expansion. Risks to global growth next year will weigh on the continuing recovery. The programme remains on track and is well-financed. Despite the market turbulence of recent months, strong programme performance has seen Irish yields reduce substantially from the highs of mid-July. Continued implementation of the agreed fiscal and financial package will help keep Ireland on course to re-achieve market entry in 2013.\nThe mission for the next programme review is scheduled for January 2012.\nFull staff report available on:"

What makes Tether so attractive to investors as a store of value is the relatively low cost of moving fiat currency to Tether and vice-versa.\n\nOur research shows that Tether - for which each unit or 'token' is backed by one US dollar held by the issuing company, Tether Limited - has been used primarily to facilitate trading. It also reveals that Tether is often traded against lower-volume cryptocurrencies, accounting for approximately 20% of Tether trading volume through the beginning of 2018. This activity often takes shape as 'pump and dump' schemes, where prices are inflated in order to be quickly sold for a profit.\n\nTether's market capitalization kept growing in 2018 even as the overall cryptocurrency market contracted. The success of Tether provides a glimpse into what the future may look like, although there's still a long way to go to bringing the traditional financial system and the cryptocurrency one closer together.\n\nOur conclusions about Tether are based on the following key findings:\n\nTether activity has grown exponentially even as major cryptocurrencies have seen declines. On exchanges that accept Tether, trade volumes for Tether (traded as US Dollars Tether - 'USDT') have grown more than 15x between October 2017 and March 2018. Traded volumes for fiat USD on non-Tether exchanges grew just under 3x over this same time period.\n\nTether serves as a cryptocurrency bank for traders by allowing individuals to store cryptocurrencies at a stable value. Tether is used almost exclusively for trading. 73% of all Tether on-chain transaction volume is going to exchanges, with only 27% being sent from exchanges, indicating that once Tether is on an exchange, it likely stays there for trading. \n\nIn mid-2017, Tether activity shifted towards being traded increasingly against low-volume cryptocurrencies. Tether also is used as a facilitator for 'pump and dump' schemes. The way traders use Tether changed over the 12 months between the middle of 2017 and middle of 2018. Through January 2018, Tether on-chain transaction volume was highly correlated with Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin transaction volumes (reaching nearly 75% correlation), implying that the trading volume was focused on these high volume cryptocurrencies.\n\n \n\nA view into what the future could look like\n\nThe rapid growth of Tether highlights the need for bank-like solutions in the cryptocurrency world even as some unfortunate side-effects emerge, namely the \"pump and dump\" schemes. This activity gets a lot of attention, often dominating headlines, which hurts confidence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nAs regulatory oversight matures in this space, it's likely that the demand for Tether as a store of value for price manipulation subsides as other use cases emerge. Notably, it remains to be seen whether new financial mechanisms evolve to serve the purpose that stablecoins such as Tether are serving today: providing a seamless way to transact between traditional fiat currencies and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRead the Full Report \n\nTo get these insights and more on darknet markets, sign up to receive early access to the complete Chainalysis Crypto Crime Report: Decoding hacks, darknet markets, and scams.

        "webpage": "EDITORS' BLOG Last Updated: Wednesday, 2 February 2005, 12:05 GMT\nGermany's jobless face tough choices\nBy Ben Richardson\nBBC News business reporter\nGermany's workforce is facing some very difficult decisions and changes\nThe Germany of the 1930s was a very different place to the nation of today.\nIt was in the midst of a global depression, was creaking under the weight of reparation payments, and had only just emerged from a period of hyper-inflation that saw people take wages home in wheelbarrows. Government figures on Wednesday, however, have shown there is in fact one striking similarity, and it has got a lot of observers very worried indeed. Unemployment has been climbing steadily and in January topped five million for the first time since the 1930s, according to the German Federal Labour Office. That pushed the jobless rate to 12.1% and has prompted calls of alarm from politicians and economists. 'Dramatically high'\nThe government called the figure \"dramatically high\", but blamed the surge from December to January on new methods of counting people who are out of work. Since the start of the year, all people claiming unemployment benefits and welfare support, as well as those termed as long-term unemployed, are officially classified as looking for work.\nFive million is still five million, and that is a pretty scary number\nMike Bayer, Ceros fund manager\nThat is why, the government said, unemployment jumped by 572,900 between December and January. \"Politicians always try to say that things aren't as bad as they look, and there may well be an effect from the changes,\" said Mike Bayer, a fund manager at Ceros in Frankfurt. \"But five million is still five million, and that is a pretty scary number.\"\n\"The German employment market is really in trouble, as is the case for a lot of European markets, and even the US,\" he continued. \"People are feeling poorer than they were a couple of years ago and they feel more insecure.\"\nA key factor in this growing sense of unease has been attempts by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government to reform Germany's inflexible labour market, and cut state spending on healthcare and pensions.\nUnder the \"Hartz IV\" programme it has set in progress the biggest overhaul of Germany's welfare system in decades, and long-established prerogatives and entitlements are disappearing. Protests have been commonplace, especially in the former communist east of the country where unemployment is higher than in the west following the closure of many state-run enterprises. At the same time, established employers including Volkswagen, Siemens and DaimlerChrysler have been negotiating hard with unions to cut costs and change employment practices among a workforce that is one of the world's most costly. Outside factors\nAs painful as they may seem, companies and politicians have little choice but to make difficult changes, analysts say, adding that the economic pressures that have helped drive unemployment are unlikely to go away. Price is almost as important as quality in manufacturing today\nGermany's economy is set to grow by between 1% and 1.5% this year, while at home and in the rest of Europe consumer demand is proving difficult to stoke. The US, meanwhile, a key destination for German products, is far from the powerhouse it was in the 1990s. With profits being squeezed in key markets, companies are going to look where and how they can manufacture products most cheaply. That means that more and more contracts are likely to head to low-cost centres such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin and South America. Labour Office deputy head Heinrich Alt said on Wednesday that unemployment in Germany was unlikely to have peaked. Bite the bullet\nFor any serious in-roads to be made into Germany's jobless rate there needs to be a major reshaping of the country's internal structure, analysts say. Unions have to be willing to give up some of their workers' rights, making it easier and cheaper for companies to hire-and-fire. Red tape, the bane of many European countries, needs to be cut so that firms can be set up quicker and with less regulation. And political parties on all sides have to be willing to sacrifice some popularity to ensure that the difficult decisions on spending and reform are taken and followed through. \"It's very sad, but I haven't seen anything in the past 10 years that makes me think the political will is there,\" said Ceros's Mr Bayer.\n\"I believe things will get better, but it will take a very long time.\"\nFive million Germans out of work\nGermany nears 1990 jobless level\nGermany's president visits Israel\n01 Feb 05 | Europe\nGerman government"

        "webpage": "| Email | Print | Share\nSeptember 28, 2012Help World's Poor: Hand Them CashBy Seth Gitter & Daniel Rothschild\nAfter Mitt Romney was captured on tape last week discussing how 47 percent of American households pay no income taxes, commentators and economists on both the left and right were quick to point that this was to a large degree driven by so-called \"refundable tax credits\" like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit.\nThese credits have enjoyed a great deal of support among conservatives because they are simple, transparent, and obviate the need for expensive and cumbersome bureaucracies. And on both the left and right, there's a widespread consensus that refundable credits work: liberals like them because they fight poverty, and conservatives see them as empowering families. Indeed, Ronald Reagan called the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which include a huge EITC expansion, \"the best anti-poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress.\"\nUnfortunately, economists and international donors have been less willing to apply domestic conventional wisdom past America's shores. Western international aid programs remain mired in big plans and bigger bureaucracy. Receive email alerts\nSign Up Seth Gitter & Daniel RothschildMexicoBrazilLatin America\nAmericaCongressRonald Reagan\nThis is a missed opportunity. Conditional cash transfers - direct payments of cash to households conditional on pro-growth behaviors like enrolling girls in school and using preventative health services - are a remarkably effective way to fight poverty abroad, and donors concerned about international development should look for ways to increase their use.\nThe idea behind cash transfers is straightforward. Like refundable tax credits, they are premised on the idea that poor people aren't ignorant, they're just poor. So providing them with small amounts of cash contingent upon certain actions provides resources without directing them in their use.\nMexico and Brazil have been at the forefront of providing conditional cash transfers to their citizens - about one in four households in these countries receive governmental or NGO aid this way. Indeed, these programs have proven so popular and ingrained that they typically survive power transfers between political parties with little more than a name change.\nThe Mexican and Brazilian cash transfer gained popularity with citizens - and international donors - because they actually work. Dozens of studies, many using randomized control trials, show these program increase school enrollment and improve nutrition. In most cases, they started as small trial programs and, having proven successful, were rolled out nationwide.\nBut despite the well-documented success of these programs, few countries in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa have rolled out conditional cash transfer programs on a national scale. The poorest countries in Latin America have failed to expand their programs beyond test programs reaching just a few percent of the total population despite a larger percentage of impoverished households than Mexico or Brazil. Furthermore, successful programs like Nicaragua's Social Safety Net have been terminated due to lack of funding.\nFor the poorest countries in Latin America to provide conditional cash transfers on the scale of Mexico or Brazil, they would have to devote between five and 10 percent of GDP to these efforts. In other words, there is no feasible way that poorer countries can scale up conditional cash transfer programs without donor funds. Fortunately, there is seemingly no limit to the number of failed and counterproductive development programs funded by international donors that could be axed in favor of conditional cash transfers.\nOne of the longstanding failures of traditional aid has been that it can serve to entrench and magnify political corruption. But pilot programs have shown that cash transfers can create significant benefits, even in countries with endemic corruption. Perhaps more importantly, conditional cash transfers are far less likely to line the pockets of dictators, since individuals tend to notice if their money goes missing. Moreover, technological innovations such as debit cards and cell phone payment systems greatly decrease the potential for corruption.\nIf nothing else, donors should remember it's not just the amount of aid that matters, but the type and effectiveness. Conditional cash transfers aren't a cure-all, and they're certainly not a substitute for an open market economy, rule of law, property rights, and entrepreneurship.\nBut they are an effective means of getting aid to the poor and encouraging pro-social, pro-family, pro-growth behaviors. And those are ideas that both liberals and conservatives can get behind.\nSeth Gitter is an assistant professor of economics at Towson University in Maryland, researching conditional cash transfers.

Rothschild is Director of External Affairs at the American Enterprise Institute.\nEmail | Print | Share\nRelated Topics: Mexico, Brazil, Latin America, America, Congress, Ronald Reagan Sign up | Sign in Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\nRelated ArticlesSeptember 17, 2012A Forgotten War in the Himalayas - Jeff Smith\nSeth Gitter & Daniel RothschildAuthor ArchiveMORE FROM THIS AUTHOR"

To coin Money.\"\n -  Constitution of the United States, Article I, Section 8\nWhen the framers of the U.S. Constitution created a new government for their untried Republic, they realized the critical need for a respected monetary system.\nSoon after the Constitution's ratification, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton personally prepared plans for a national Mint.\nOn April 2, 1792, Congress passed The Coinage Act, which created the Mint and authorized construction of a Mint building in the nation's capital, Philadelphia.\nThis was the first federal building erected under the Constitution.\nSince our institution's founding in 1792, the men and women of the United States Mint have taken great pride in rendering the story of our nation in enduring examples of numismatic art.\nTo hold a coin or medal produced by the U.S. Mint is to connect to the founding principles of our nation and the makings of our economy.\nHere and abroad, people cherish our products because they are stores of value as well as exquisite encapsulations of America's ideals.\nIn forms designed to be passed from hand to hand and saved from generation to generation, the coins we mint reflect our shared history and traditions.\nWhether it is learning to count with pennies, understanding the value of saving through the weight of a piggy bank or remembering the coin toss at your first football game, coins connect us to many of our fondest memories.\nPerhaps most importantly, the United States Mint connects us with the core values of America.\nFrom the great promise of our \"E Pluribus Unum\" credo beneath the banner of Liberty, each coin is a small share in the ongoing American Experience, linking us in an unbroken line to our country's - and the Mint's - origins in the Constitution. The United States Mint was created by Congress in 1792 and became part of the Department of the Treasury in 1873. It is the Nation's sole manufacturer of legal tender coinage and is responsible for producing circulating coinage for the Nation to conduct its trade and commerce. The United States Mint also produces numismatic products, including proof, uncirculated, and commemorative coins; Congressional Gold Medals; and silver and gold bullion coins. The United States Mint's numismatic programs are self-sustaining and operate at no cost to the taxpayer.\nMission The primary mission of the United States Mint is to serve the American people by manufacturing and distributing circulating, precious metal and collectible coins and national medals, and providing security over assets entrusted to us.\nLocations The United States Mint operates six\nfacilities across the United States with each facility performing unique functions.\nCurrent facilities include the Headquarters in Washington, DC; production facilities in Philadelphia, PA; West Point, NY; Denver, CO; and San Francisco, CA; and the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, KY.\nFor information about U.S. paper currency, please contact the\nBureau of Engraving and Printing."

In the past few months, AMI has grown in both number of clients they work with and employees at the organization.Chris Mendezona, executive director of AMI and marketing junior, said this business model assists individuals who would not be able to receive assistance through banks because of their business' size or sales revenue.\"Banks aren't looking to bother with small loans like that,\" he said. \"Our clients are under-resourced entrepreneurs. We don't want to get them under a mountain of debt.\"AMI offers half-year or one-year loans with payments that have an interest rate of 10 percent, an amount much lower than what banks generally charge. Mendezona said the goal of these loans is not to grow personal wealth for AMI employees, but rather to give clients a chance at finding financial success.\"Since we're not growing revenue for ourselves, the money goes to small operations and future loans,\" he said. \"It works out great. We're taking money and putting it back out.\"Payments are often on a flexible schedule. Mendezona said he had a client whose furnace broke the week a payment was due, so AMI restructured his loan to ensure he would have enough resources to fix the appliance as soon as possible.In addition to microloans, AMI offers classes and individual face-to-face meetings with entrepreneurs to create business strategies and future plans. Additionally, clients must also schedule monthly meetings with an AMI member to address any business concerns they have.\"There's a social interest,\" Mendezona said. \"We get involved in their company so that customers pay us back. We have 100 percent payments made.\"Mendezona said there were some challenges for AMI to gain credibility as a viable resource for business owners. However, he said clients quickly overcame the peculiarity of working with college students.\"When you're a 20-year-old walking to go meet with a middle-aged businessperson, it can be hard to get that respect,\" he said. \"After building a relationship, they see we provide benefits to them.\"Because business owners often are unfamiliar with modern technologies and strategies, they rely on the contemporary knowledge and business training these students offer.Jeff Wells, one of the founders of AMI and a senior majoring in computer science, said the classes AMI hosts are a combination of strengths that both students and their clients benefit from when collaborating together.\"They have the drive, but not the business theory behind it,\" he said. \"It's a really good mix of their experience on their side and the academic theory on our side.\"In classes and personal meetings, students from AMI use the tools they learned through ASU business programs to help their clients make the best decisions for their startups.\"We're always changing something, innovating to keep relevancy,\" Wells said. \"We have a model to determine if it's going to be successful based on their sales numbers, because we don't want to put them in debt.\"Since AMI was founded three years ago, it has grown in both number of employees and clients. Although Wells is graduating in May, he expects this trend to continue.\"We have a solid foundation and we are ready to explode,\" he said. \"From here, moving on is going to be straight growth.\"Carla Keaton is one of three business owners who makes monthly payments on a loan with AMI. She owns a business named Un Petit Merlot that offers in-house wine and painting parties.She said she believes the frequent meetings with students have allowed her to reach financial success.\"I did get a loan, but I think more (important) was the marketing help from them,\" she said. \"They actually meet with me, and that's what is really nice.\"For example, Keaton said she did not know how to create a website for her business. However, one web design student from AMI helped her build a greater presence on the web. She said it's these kinds of resources that separate AMI from traditional bank loans.\"There's somebody there that can help you with any aspect of what you need,\" Keaton said. \"They see new, sometimes non-traditional ways of approaching things. They actually really want to help you succeed.\"Reach the reporter at  or follow her on Twitter @sharir55\nPatagonia head philosopher speaks to ASU students about sustainability\nBy Ethan Millman"

Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters\nWednesday 14 December 2011 05.19 EST\nThere are many puzzles about the British government's tactics at last week's EU summit. One is why it chose to identify the City of London as the \"vital national interest\" that needed special protection. The City, after all, is the most unpopular \"national champion\" that the UK possesses. It accounts for a smaller share of UK GDP and employment than the manufacturing sector (yes, you read that right). And the era of \"light touch\" financial regulation in the UK has in any case drawn to a close: since the global financial crisis, the UK has implemented many reforms before they were adopted at EU level; and in some areas the UK has gone further than other EU countries are prepared to contemplate (unlike the UK, no other EU country has plans to separate the retail and investment banking operations of its banks).\nWhy, then, did the British government believe that the City needed special protection? Part of the answer is to be found in continental Europe. Ever since the global financial crisis, politicians in France, Germany and elsewhere have often presented their task as bringing \"unregulated Anglo-Saxon finance\" to heel.\nPresident Sarkozy has repeatedly spoken of the death of \"unregulated Anglo-Saxon finance\", while chancellor Merkel has stated that the EU would no longer be dictated to by the City of London. The eurozone debt crisis has only reinforced continental suspicions of the City: politicians in Berlin, Paris and elsewhere often see it as a nest of speculators whose activities pose a threat to the eurozone's survival. On this view, the City must be tamed if the eurozone is to be saved.\nUntil last week, Britain, the EU and the City formed what could be called a triangle of suspicion. The British government did not want to drive business out of London, but it did want to reduce the cost that the financial sector potentially inflicts on British taxpayers. The EU proposed a vast programme of reforms - some that the UK had committed itself to in the G20, others (such as regulations targeting hedge funds) reflecting French and German concerns. The City, for its part, tried to water down what it held to be the most egregious aspects of the new rules. Although not an unconditional supporter of the City, the British government was more sensitive to the City's concerns than other EU countries and could use its political influence to amend EU legislation where necessary.\nWill the British government's attempts to seek special safeguards for the City change the nature of this game? There are two reasons for thinking that it could. The first is that it is likely to change the atmospherics, to the detriment of the UK and the City. Seen from Europe, the UK held the fate of the eurozone hostage to the interests of its financial centre. For many in the EU, the City and British Euroscepticism are now associated - a perception that will not help the City persuade the EU to take its interests into account. The second reason is that the UK could be marginalised in the bodies that adopt EU legislation: the risk is that the substance of new EU legislation will be determined by a caucus of other member states.\nUnsurprisingly, many in the City are ambivalent about David Cameron's tactics at the EU summit in Brussels last week. Some have welcomed the prime minister's stance, but others fear it will backfire. Consider the most contentious proposal in the EU's legislative pipeline: a proposed financial transactions tax that would fall disproportionately on the UK and the City. Until last week, it seemed that Britain had a fair chance of thwarting it. But many in the City now worry that other countries will be less inclined to listen to British objections and push the tax through regardless. Britain may also find it harder to challenge requirements that clearing houses for derivatives transactions be located in the eurozone. Paris and Frankfurt are keen to drive business away from London and towards the eurozone.\nIn short, last week's summit could turn out to be bad for the City. Far from defending the City against ill-conceived initiatives originating in Brussels, the government may actively invite them. The reason is that it has marginalised itself politically, and that it has only increased long-standing suspicions in the rest of Europe that British Euroscepticism and the City of London are natural bedfellows."

Students will spend the first and final semesters at Olin Business School in St. Louis and three semesters in Seoul at Yonsei University.Curriculum includes immersion courses in New York and Washington, D.C. that explore U.S. financial markets, policymaking, legislative processes, enforcement agencies and the Federal Reserve. The courses in Washington D.C. are offered in collaboration with Brookings Executive Education, part of The Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization. Washington University successfully launched a similar dual degree program with Singapore Management University in 2013.A half-century of partnershipThe business schools at Washington University and Yonsei University have a long history of partnership that began more than half a century ago. Between 1958 and 1962, Washington University's business school, under the auspices of the United States Department of State and the United States Overseas Mission, worked with Yonsei University and two other Korean universities, to bring together experienced businessmen, academic authorities, and advanced graduate students for the purpose of modernizing Korean business practices. Student exchange programs were also established at that time. Ja Song was one of the first Korean exchange students in 1958. He became a professor, dean of Yonsei business school, and then president of the university in 1992. Song was named minister of education in South Korea in 2000.To learn more about the Global MSF Dual Degree Program,  video about the Dual Degree  Permalink to this article"

A Hedge Fund Like No OtherBy Simon Johnson and James Kwak \ufffd11\nGiven the panic in Washington over the financial markets, it is virtually certain that Congress will soon pass some form of the bailout plan the Treasury put forward last week. This is not an ideal proposal, particularly since it does not address the underlying problem with mortgages and negative housing equity. No troubled mortgage holders would benefit directly, and key commercial banks might still end up undercapitalized.\nHowever, no legislator wants to risk allowing the economy to collapse on his or her watch, and, according to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, that is what's at stake. Within these political realities, there is a key issue on which lawmakers should focus, quickly, in designing this legislation: governance.\nThe draft proposal authorizes the Treasury to \"purchase . . . on such terms and conditions as determined by the secretary, mortgage-related assets from any financial institution having its headquarters in the United States.\" In effect, this would invest $700 billion (for starters) of taxpayer money in a hedge fund controlled by a single person, the Treasury secretary. Given the urgency of the effort and the complex nature of the securities involved, this de facto fund would be government-run but overseen largely by Wall Street veterans; any actual management would probably be outsourced to existing fund management companies.\nOrdinarily, the interests of hedge fund managers and investors are at least somewhat aligned by the fee structure of hedge funds, in which managers are paid 2 percent of assets under management plus a share of the returns over a certain threshold (commonly 20 percent). In addition, competition in the industry dictates that fund managers with below-market returns are less likely to be able to raise new funds. But neither of these incentives exists in this case.\nManagement fees cannot be tied to fund returns in the usual manner because the fund is highly likely -- some would say designed -- to lose money. To restore our nation's banks to health, the fund must pay above-market prices for mortgage-backed securities; if it paid market prices (about 22 cents on the dollar, based on the largest known recent transaction), that would simply trigger the massive write-downs that everyone fears. Because there is no competition for this fund, and no one involved is planning to raise another, the second incentive doesn't apply. Worse, the Treasury-appointed fund managers negotiating with banks to buy their mortgage-backed securities not only come from those banks but will almost certainly be looking for jobs at those banks once the need for the fund has passed, creating enormous potential conflicts of interest.\nWhile the usual mechanisms for aligning incentives are unavailable, the stakes are unprecedented. Every dollar that the fund loses is a dollar handed from taxpayers to the banks and their shareholders. While previous bailouts, including that of AIG, have been designed to give the government at least some of the potential upside, the only upside here is that these securities may turn out to be worth more in the long term than the market thinks they are worth today. Despite this possibility, paying more for something than anyone else is willing to pay is, simply put, a sucker's bet. It is most likely that \"governance\" over the fund will be provided by periodic hearings of the relevant Senate and House committees during which the Treasury secretary and the fund managers will be asked why they overpaid for banks' securities and will answer that there was no choice if the financial system was to be saved.\nWhile there is still time, Congress should consider alternative means of aligning incentives. For example, lawmakers could set a target for what return the fund is expected to get, and managers' compensation could be tied to their actual return relative to that target. Would-be fund managers should bid in an open process what target return they are willing to base their compensation on -- the management company that is willing to accept the highest (or least negative) target for a set of assets would get the contract for those assets.\nIn any case, the fund should provide full disclosure of the securities it buys, its valuation of them and the price paid, which would help ensure that the fund is managed in the country's best interests. Its leaders should be open about overpaying relative to market price, and on that basis, the fund should receive preferred stock in any participating bank. This would, among other things, give taxpayers some much deserved and long overdue potential upside.\nSimon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is a professor at MIT and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

The bank defines this condition as living on less than $1.25 a day. The bank estimates there are 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.A spokeswoman for Oxfam , the anti-poverty group, Emma Seery, said while the World Bank target was welcome \"we are concerned that it will duck the tough choices needed to reach it.\"The weekend began with two days of discussions among finance leaders of the Group of 20 nations, composed of major economies such as the United States, Germany and Japan and fast-growing developing nations like China, Brazil and India. The meetings of the IMF and its sister lending institution, The World Bank, followed.The finance ministers tried to show they were cooperating even though they did not resolve differences that surfaced after an initially flawed bailout of Cyprus in March. The banking troubles on the Mediterranean island renewed fears that a prolonged European debt crisis still posed risks to the global economy.The U.S. urged European nations to scale back their austerity programs of spending cuts and tax increases in favor of more stimulus to boost growth and combat high unemployment in countries such as Spain and Greece.But the push was met with resistance from Germany and Britain, which believe heavily indebted European nations must reduce their debts to give markets confidence and keep government borrowing costs low. In the end, the financial leaders sought to bridge the difference by issuing economic blueprints that left room for both the growth and austerity camps to claim victory.The G-20 nations did reject proposals to issue hard targets for reducing budget deficits, a victory for the United States and Japan, which had argued for more flexibility."

        "webpage": "Bernanke defends policies\nPublished: Tuesday, Oct. 2, 2012 1:15 a.m.\ufffdCDT\nBy AP Economics Writer MARTIN CRUTSINGER (AP)WASHINGTON (AP) - Chairman Ben Bernanke offered a wide-ranging defense Monday of the Federal Reserve's bold policies to stimulate the still-weak economy.\nThe Fed needs to drive down borrowing rates because the economy isn't growing fast enough to reduce high unemployment, Bernanke said in a speech to the Economic Club of Indiana. The unemployment rate is 8.1 percent.Low rates could also help shrink the federal budget deficit by easing the government's borrowing costs and generating tax revenue from stronger growth, Bernanke argued.The chairman cautioned Congress against adopting a law that would allow it to review the Fed's interest-rate policy discussions. The House has passed legislation to give Congress' investigative arm broader authority to audit the Fed, including reviewing its interest-rate policymaking. The Senate hasn't adopted the bill.Bernanke warned that such a step would improperly inject political pressure into the Fed's private deliberations and make officials less likely to act.His speech follows the Fed's decision at its Sept. 12-13 meeting to launch a new mortgage-buying program to try to help boost the housing market, spur hiring and accelerate economic growth. The Fed said it would keep buying the bonds until the job market showed substantial improvement. It also decided to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero through at least mid-2015.In his speech, Bernanke sought to reassure investors that the Fed's timetable for keeping rates low \"doesn't mean we expect the economy to be weak through 2015.\" Rather, he said the Fed expects to keep rates low well after the economy strengthens.Bernanke spoke two days before President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney will hold a debate in which the economy is the central theme. And on Friday, the government will release its September jobs report. Economists expect only modest hiring gains and continued unemployment above 8 percent.The U.S. economy is still struggling more than three years after the Great Recession ended. High unemployment and weak pay growth have made consumers more cautious about spending, which has hurt manufacturing and slowed broader growth.Bernanke reiterated his argument that lower rates boost growth by helping increase prices of stocks, homes and other assets. Greater household wealth tends to make consumers and businesses more willing to spend.Bernanke noted that when the Fed launched its first round of bond buying in late 2008, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was a little above 6 percent. Today, the rate is 3.4 percent, the lowest since long-term mortgages began in the 1950s.Still, the housing market's recovery remains slow, in part because many Americans lack the credit to qualify for a mortgage or can't afford the larger down payments now required.The Fed's decision last month to launch a new mortgage-buying program was approved by its policy committee, 11-1. Jeffrey Lacker, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, cast the lone dissenting vote. Lacker has argued that further bond buying won't likely provide much economic help and risks igniting inflation in the future.Charles Plosser, president of the Fed's Philadelphia regional bank, and Richard Fisher, president of the Fed's Dallas regional bank, have also been critical of the Fed's bond purchases. Plosser and Fisher do not have votes on the Fed's policy committee this year but take part in the discussions.\nAt the same time, one Fed official who had been skeptical of the bond buying now appears more open to it. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, has signaled that he's grown more concerned about the economy's sluggish growth. In a speech a week after last month's policy meeting, Kocherlakota said the Fed should fight high unemployment with an even more aggressive approach than it announced.Still, like Plosser and Fisher, Kocherlakota lacks a vote on the Fed's policy committee this year.\nBargain chains lead list of fastest-growing retailersSept. 22, 2016 - 10:30 pm\nBanks focus more on new accounts - and the fees they bringSept. 19, 2016 - 9:29 pm\nMore pay-TV subscribers cut cord; 812,000 in second quarterAug. 30, 2016 - 11:34 pm"

        "webpage": "What Really Got Measured In This Month's Jobs Report?\nShare Tweet E-mail Print By Marilyn Geewax Originally published on Fri November 8, 2013 2:58 pm\nGraphic designer Tom Sadowski, 65, works from home in Sterling, Va., in October. Many experts believe the economy is becoming too complicated for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure accurately using current methods.\nIn October, private employers did a lot of hiring, but a government shutdown forced hundreds of thousands of workers to stay home. Those federal furloughs offset 204,000 jobs created last month  -  enough to push the unemployment rate one tick higher to 7.3 percent, the Labor Department said on Friday. Or maybe the end of that sentence should read: the Labor Department guessed on Friday. Many economists say the jobs report has \"noise\" in it, with a hodgepodge of data showing more hiring, but also fewer people even trying to find jobs. So what created the noise? For one thing, the Labor Department's household survey counted furloughed federal workers as unemployed, which boosted the jobless rate by one-tenth of a percentage point. But outside of government, employers were hiring. Manufacturers alone added 19,000 jobs, and the leisure and hospitality sector hired 53,000 more people. Here's the strange thing: The percentage of people saying they are in the labor force fell to 62.8 percent, down 0.4 percent to the lowest level since 1978. Usually, as hiring perks up, more people come into the job market, not leave. So October's report contains some head-scratching results. If that represented a one-month problem, economists would dismiss it as just an anomaly. But many say they are worried that month after month, the employment reports are becoming more misleading. These skeptics believe the U.S. economy is becoming too complicated and technologically advanced for the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure using current methods. This week, Wells Fargo Economics Group released an analysis saying the BLS data are antiquated because they don't accurately measure the digital workforce. \"Simply stated, the labor market of the 21st century is quite different than in the past,\" it said. Wells Fargo chief economist John Silvia says millions of Americans now prefer to work part time, whether developing apps for smartphones or walking dogs. \"Back in the 1980s, either you had a job or you didn't have a job,\" he says. \"What we have in the 21st century is a lot of part-time workers who want to be part time. The mix is much more complicated.\" The government measures the labor market with two tools: 1) payroll data provided by employers, and 2) responses to household surveys about work done in the previous week. But in today's economy, many workers can be hard to capture with those two measures. Here's an example: A woman works from home as a writer, so she is not on any company's payroll. When a BLS employee calls to gather information for the household survey, he might ask: \"Did you work last week?\" And her answer could be no, but only because she had spent the previous week taking care of her elderly mother. And now she is working a 60-hour week to finish up a writing project. In the BLS data, she may look unemployed. In her own eyes, she's making a good living with a flexible schedule. \"If we're going to catch the flavor of today's labor market, you need other elements to be brought in\" besides payroll data and household surveys, Silvia says. For the BLS to really capture what's happening in the labor market, \"they would have to ask a lot more questions, and even then, it would still be hard,\" says Richard Pearson, chief marketing officer for Elance, a Silicon Valley-based company that matches up employers with software engineers, Web designers and other digital freelancers. Pearson says many people are working hard  -  designing apps or participating in team projects involving employers in other countries. But he believes their efforts are not being measured by the BLS. The monthly jobs report \"is so valuable, and yet if you look deep down into it, you see the problems,\" he says. \"They are asking things like, 'Do you work on a farm?' \" BLS press officer Gary Steinberg says there is value to the steadiness of the monthly jobs report. The BLS has been collecting payroll data since 1939, and conducting the household survey since 1948. \"Making changes would mean the data won't be comparable\" over the many decades tracked by the BLS, he says. \"We wouldn't know if things were up and down from another time period.\" At Wells Fargo, economists have created their own Labor Market Index, which uses six different measures to try to assess whether life is getting better or worse for workers. \"The unemployment rate can't be the only thing you look at,\" says Silvia. \"It's a different ballgame now.\"Copyright 2014 NPR.

        "webpage": "Search this site Policy Analysis No. 586\nHas U.S. Income Inequality Really Increased?\nBy Alan Reynolds\nJanuary 8, 2007 Executive Summary\nThere are frequent complaints that U.S. income inequality has increased in recent decades. Estimates of rising inequality that are widely cited in the media are often based on federal income tax return data. Those data appear to show that the share of U.S. income going to the top 1 percent (those people with the highest incomes) has increased substantially since the 1970s.\nHowever, there have been large changes in U.S. tax rules over time that have made a dramatic difference on what is reported as income on individual tax returns. Tax changes induced thousands of businesses to switch from filing under the corporate tax system to filing under the individual tax system. Corporate executives switched from accepting stock options taxed as capital gains to nonqualified stock options taxed as salaries. The huge growth in tax-favored savings plans, such as 401(k)s, has resulted in billions of dollars of investment income disappearing from tax returns. Meanwhile, studies of inequality that are based on tax return data usually exclude transfer payments, which results in exaggerating the shares of income received by those at the top by ignoring growing amounts of income at the bottom.\nMeasurements of inequality have also been affected by large reductions in income tax rates, particularly in 1986. Estimates by many economists indicate that the reported income of highincome taxpayers is very responsive to tax rates. When top tax rates on wages or capital gains fall, reported incomes rise, and a larger fraction of the incomes of those at the top show up on tax returns. International comparisons show that reported income shares of those at the top have risen the most where top tax rates have been cut the most (the United States, the United Kingdom, and India) and have risen the least where top tax rates have remained very high (France and Japan).\nIn sum, studies based on tax return data provide highly misleading comparisons of changes to the U.S. income distribution because of dramatic changes in tax rules and tax reporting in recent decades. Aside from stock option windfalls during the late-1990s stock-market boom, there is little evidence of a significant or sustained increase in the inequality of U.S. incomes, wages, consumption, or wealth over the past 20 years.\nRead the Full Policy Analysis PDF (1.32 MB)\nAlan Reynolds is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and author of Income and Wealth (Greenwood Press, 2006).

Managing food, health and educational needs has been a struggle, and not only for the very poorest. For some, particularly children, the impacts may be permanent: children who drop out of school to earn or because their parents cannot afford fees, books or breakfast, are unlikely to re-enrol once food prices decline.\"\nResearchers stressed that it was difficult to untangle which aspects of hardship could be directly traced to either the current economic crisis, the fuel and food price rises of last year or the local political situation, but drew broader conclusions from studying the impact of previous recessions. \"Evidence shows that poverty, malnutrition and infant mortality increased during every national financial crisis in the past 11 years,\" said Neil McCulloch, who headed the IDS research. \"The current crisis is global and the effects on households, businesses and trade in developing countries are evident.\" A separate study released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap) concluded yesterday that Asian and Pacific countries are particularly vulnerable to the triple threat of food and fuel price volatility, climate change and the global economic crisis. The emergence of all three crises at the same time has \"hit the world's poor the hardest,\" Escap's executive secretary, Noeleen Heyzer, said, warning that the financial crisis could result in political instability and social unrest."

        "webpage": "BY SHELDON RICHMAN | MARCH 27, 2013 The Dow Jones is lying\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is at a record high, and the unemployment rate has ticked down to 7.7 percent, but this is no time to celebrate. The economy is still in the doldrums. A little perspective: The news media trumpet changes in the Dow as though it tells us almost all we need to know about the economic fate of the American people. That's nonsense. Not everyone thinks the arbitrary index of 30 busily traded blue-chip stocks is terribly relevant to gauging the condition of the economy. Moreover, the average, which reflects the daily change in the companies' stock prices, is not adjusted for inflation. In nominal terms the Dow hit a record high of 14,447.29 this month. But in real adjusted terms, the average is only at the level reached in the year 2000. In other words, if you invested in the companies that year, you're no richer now, because the dollar has depreciated thanks to the Federal Reserve. That doesn't sound so remarkable. Fixation on the Dow might encourage neglect of other, less upbeat economic indicators. While the DJIA soared, the unemployment rate dropped to only 7.7 percent last month, which is disturbingly high, especially when you consider that the Great Recession officially ended more than three and a half years ago. Even better light is shed on the employment picture by looking at the civil employment-population ratio. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before the recession the rate was over 63 percent. During the recession it hit a low of slightly over 58 percent and has barely recovered since. (In the late 1990s it was close to 65 percent.) In light of such dismal signs, how are we to account for the stock market? The Federal Reserve is working hard to keep key interest rates close to zero. The Fed has bought hundreds of billions of dollars in long-term government securities (Operation Twist) in order to lower the return from such investments. This drives money seeking a bigger return into the stock market and commodities. If this explains the run-up in stock prices, it sounds more like a bubble than a marker of returning economic growth. The government and its central bank, in fact, have done virtually everything wrong if their intention was to put the economy on a sustainable path to prosperity. The recession was caused by distortions created by government housing and monetary policies. Instead of backing off and letting the economy realign with real economic factors, the Obama administration and the Bernanke Fed seem intent on reinflating the pre-recession housing bubble as well as inflating a new stock-market bubble. (The Fed has also been buying up mortgage bonds from banks to help stimulate housing sales.) This is a dangerous path. By definition, such artificially induced frenzies cannot be sustained. When officials get nervous and pull back, the bubbles will burst and the economy will be back in recession. Even if employment gains are made during the apparent recovery, they will be short-lived, and the unemployment rate will turn up again. This government policy, therefore, is a cruel hoax on workers who were harmed by the earlier recession, who have struggled to get back on track, and who are now being set up for a reprise of their misery.\nThe architects of this shameful program are would-be social engineers who think they can design something as complex as a modern industrial economy. Such conceit should be obvious to all. Simply put, it is impossible for politicians, bureaucrats, and economic advisers to acquire the knowledge they would need to possess in order to accomplish what they say they want to accomplish. The knowledge most vital for smooth-running markets is not aggregate statistical data available to government agencies. Rather, it consists in the subjective preferences of consumers, the expectations of producers, and the radically decentralized and dispersed information about resources, technologies, and techniques. The market's price system captures and conveys this information in a way that government operatives could never dream of. In fact, compared to the collective wisdom of the market process, politicians, bureaucrats, and economic advisers are dismal ignoramuses. It's time they learned some humility and let us alone.

        "webpage": "All Latest Stories\nThe New Europe comments Chipping away at Swiss bank secrecy By Alanna Petroff @AlannaPetroff July 5, 2013: 7:57 AM ET Credit Suisse is among the Swiss banks that is in ongoing discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice to avoid legal action. LONDON (CNNMoney) Switzerland issued new guidelines this week to its banks that should make it easier for the U.S. to catch American tax evaders who are hiding money in offshore accounts. Switzerland has been under intense pressure to find a way to allow its banks to share information with U.S. authorities so they may avoid potentially crippling legal action. The Swiss government intervened after parliament nixed changes to a rule that prevented the banks from cooperating with the U.S. The new guidelines allow the banks to apply for permission to provide the U.S. with certain information about offshore bank accounts. They're still blocked from revealing information about individual clients, but can share details about employees who worked on the accounts and about accounts that were transferred to other banks. Related: Got a Swiss bank account? Time to fess up. The change formalizes an approach that allowed UBS (UBS) to settle tax evasion claims with U.S. authorities in 2009 at a cost of $780 million in fines and restitution, and chips away further at the country's strict banking secrecy laws. Those laws helped foster the world's largest $2.2 trillion offshore banking industry, where account holders were able to hide assets and avoid taxes in their home countries. Swiss banks have slowly been losing their unique selling point of extreme client anonymity and discretion, and the latest move could accelerate change in the industry . Billions of dollars have been withdrawn from Swiss offshore accounts in recent years and the industry is facing increasing pressure from rising financial powers in Asia-Pacific. London research firm WealthInsight expects that Singapore will overtake Switzerland to become the largest global offshore wealth center by 2020. While the outlook may seem bleak, Swiss banks are likely to welcome the ability to reveal certain information to authorities if it reduces the risk of harsh U.S. legal action and hefty fines. In early 2012, Swiss bank Wegelin and Co. was forced to shut down after being charged by the Department of Justice with helping American taxpayers hide more than $1.2 billion from the Internal Revenue Service. Related: U.S. citizens ditch passports in record numbers Swiss banks have been planning for secrecy rule adjustments for well over a decade, said Kinner Lakhani, a senior equity analyst at Citi Research. \"They expected that banking secrecy would not last forever,\" he said. The banks are now focusing their efforts on helping clients transition to onshore, transparent accounts, he said. They are also expanding in emerging markets and improving their offerings for ultra high-net-worth individuals, he said. \"This is part of an ongoing process of normalization of the Swiss banking landscape,\" said Lakhani. \"There will be further evolution that will take Switzerland into the direction of being a private banking center for reasons other than banking secrecy,\" he said. Other European countries are also caving into pressure to share more information about bank accounts. Luxembourg announced in April that it would begin sharing information about depositors' accounts in 2015, just two days after fellow hold-out Austria signaled it would enter EU negotiations to do the same.

Jang said the feasibility of opening Taiwan's market comprehensively to Chinese investors should be re-evaluated because it could bring more harm than benefits to local companies\nNational Taiwan University economics department chairwoman Jang Show-ling gestures during an interview with the Taipei Times on June 30.Photo: Wang Min-wei, Taipei Times\nTaipei Times (TT): To promote the service trade agreement with China, the government recently launched a series of forums to help the public understand how it handled the negotiations on the pact. How do you interpret this move?Jang Show-ling (\u912d\u79c0\u73b2 Jang): The government mainly consulted and exchanged opinions with large enterprises in the banking, construction and e-commerce sectors. However, the government did not consult with small and medium-sized companies in the service sector, which could be most affected by the pact. That is why the government now has to ease the public's concern about the impact of the agreement.Apparently, the government did not side with the \"small\" number of local companies and did not take their needs into consideration. The government failed to prove it is capable of safeguarding local businesses' interest.It might be right for the government to help enterprises break into new markets, but it is unacceptable that this comes at the expense of small companies' interests. The government should at least come up with effective support measures to minimize the potential adverse impacts of opening up to Chinese investment.The government needs to renegotiate with China over terms of the pact, or the agreement should be reassessed rule by rule in the Legislative Yuan to let legislators determine whether the public can embrace such pact or not.TT: Do you think the government failed to communicate with local service providers while preparing to sign the agreement? Why is the public concerned about the pact?Jang: It was a norm for government officials to visit local industry unions to collect suggestions before signing any trade agreements. The government did so in 2001 when vying the join to the WTO and inking the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement in 2010 [ECFA].\nThis time, however, things were different. Officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Council for Economic Planning and Development, and the Mainland Affairs Council acted like typical bureaucrats, following every order from their superiors in order to sign the pact on time without thoroughly evaluating or discussing with industry representatives.TT: In your opinion, what is the biggest problem of the pact?Jang: Small and medium-sized enterprises make up the majority of Taiwan's service sector. Currently, there are 935,000 enterprises in the service sector, and service providers that require manual labor account for up to 86 percent, which shows how the pact might dramatically affect local service providers' job security because Chinese investors might create job openings for low-entry positions at a low wage rate as they do in China.From a different perspective, given that there are more than 5 million people  -  accounting for 58 percent of Taiwan's total workers  -  working in the service sector, flow of funds, knowledge and labor could harm the economy. The adverse impact could be huge as the output of services accounted for nearly 70 percent of the nation's GDP last year.TT: What kind of outcome do you foresee if the pact takes effect?Jang: The people who will benefit from the agreement are mostly professionals in the financial, telecommunications, accounting, construction and medical sectors.Given that their services require knowledge, doctors, accountants or civil engineers can find employment and business opportunities in China."

        "webpage": "President Obama to propose $1.5 trillion in new tax revenue | Times Free Press Local\nPresident Obama to propose $1.5 trillion in new tax revenue President Obama to propose $1.5 trillion in new tax revenue September 19th, 2011\nPresident Barack Obama gestures as he speaks on his American Jobs Act legislation, Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2011, at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, N.C. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\nWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama's proposal to reduce long-term deficits with $1.5 trillion in new taxes is less an opening bid in a negotiation than it is an opening salvo in a struggle to draw sharp contrasts with congressional Republicans.\nObama's proposal is aimed predominantly at the wealthy and comes just days after House Speaker John Boehner ruled out tax increases to lower deficits. It also comes amid a clamor in his own Democratic Party for Obama to take a tougher stance against Republicans. And while the plan stands little chance of passing Congress, its populist pitch is one that the White House believes the public can support.\nThe core of the president's plan totals just more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years. It combines the new taxes with $580 billion in cuts to mandatory benefit programs, including $248 billion from Medicare.\nThe administration also counts savings of $1 trillion over 10 years from the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe deficit reduction plan represents an economic bookend to the $447 billion in tax cuts and new public works spending that Obama has proposed as a short-term measure to stimulate the economy and create jobs. He's submitting his deficit fighting plan to a special joint committee of Congress that is charged with recommending deficit reductions of up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years.\nIn a defiant note, administration officials made clear Sunday that Obama would veto any Medicare benefit cuts that aren't paired with tax increases on upper-income people.\nOfficials cast Obama's plan as his vision for deficit reduction, and distinguished it from the negotiations he had with Boehner in July as Obama sought to avoid a government default.\nAs a result, it includes no changes in Social Security and no increase in the Medicare eligibility age, which the president had been willing to accept this summer.\nMoreover, the new tax revenue Obama is seeking is nearly double the $800 billion that Boehner had been willing to consider in July. Republicans were already lining up against the president's tax proposal before they even knew the magnitude of what he intended to recommend.\n\"Class warfare may make for really good politics but it makes for rotten economics,\" GOP Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman, said Sunday in reaction to one Obama tax proposal to impose a minimum tax rate on wealthy filers.\nKey features of Obama's plan, as described by senior administration officials Sunday evening:\n-$1.5 trillion in new revenue, which would include about $800 billion realized over 10 years from repealing the Bush-era tax rates for couples making more than $250,000. It also would place limits on deductions for wealthy filers and end certain corporate loopholes and subsidies for oil and gas companies.\n-$580 billion in cuts in mandatory benefit programs, including $248 billion in Medicare and $72 billion in Medicaid and other health programs. Other mandatory benefit programs include farm subsidies.\n-$430 billion in savings from lower interest payment on the national debt.\nBy adding about $1 trillion in spending cuts already enacted by Congress and counting about $1 trillion in savings from the drawdown of military forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, the combined deficit reduction would total more than $4 trillion over 10 years, senior administration officials said.\nRepublicans have ridiculed the war savings as gimmicky, but House Republicans included them in their budget proposal this year and Boehner had agreed to count them as savings during debt ceiling negotiations with the president this summer.\nObama backed away from proposing sweeping changes to Medicare, following the advice of fellow Democrats that it would only give political cover to a privatization plan supported by House Republicans that turned to be unpopular with older Americans.\nAdministration officials said 90 percent of the $248 billion in 10-year Medicare cuts would be squeezed from service providers. The plan does shift some additional costs to beneficiaries, but those changes would not start until 2017.\nIllustrating Obama's populist pitch on tax revenue, one proposal would set a minimum tax on taxpayers making $1 million or more in income. The measure - Obama is going to call it the \"Buffett Rule\" for billionaire investor Warren Buffett - is designed to prevent millionaires from taking advantage of lower tax rates on investment earnings than what middle-income taxpayers pay on their wages.\nAt issue is the difference between a taxpayer's tax bracket and the effective tax rate that taxpayer pays. Millionaires face a 35 percent tax bracket, while middle income filers fall in the 15 or 25 percent bracket. But investment income is taxed at 15 percent and Buffett has complained that he and other wealthy people have been \"coddled long enough\" and shouldn't be paying a smaller share of their income in federal taxes than middle-class taxpayers.\nGeorgia board to meet on high-profile case of Troy Davis Read next article\nRyan throws 4 TDs, Falcons rally past Eagles 35-31"

        "webpage": "Algirdas \u0160emeta\nCommissioner responsible for Taxation and Customs Union, Statistics, Audit and Anti-fraud\nSpeaking Points on Standard VAT Return Press conference\nBrussels, 23 October 2013\nLadies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to present to you today a proposal which will have a radical effect on the cost and simplicity of doing business in the EU; A proposal which will remove one of the major tax obstacles for companies in our Single Market, saving businesses up to \u20ac15 billion a year. A proposal which will also facilitate greater tax compliance and, as such, offer Member States important new revenues without the need for higher taxes. I am talking about the new Standard VAT Return, which the Commission has adopted today. The Standard VAT Return hits at the heart of one of the biggest problems reported to us by businesses operating in the Single Market, namely the headache of 28 very different systems for declaring VAT. Taxpayers operating cross-border have to battle with a complex medley of information requirements, procedures and deadlines, just to declare the VAT that they owe. For example, some Member States ask for monthly declarations, others ask for quarterly ones. The number of information boxes to be completed ranges from as few as 6, in Ireland, to 99 in Hungary - and even up to 586 boxes in Italy. At best, all these divergences are costly and burdensome. At worst, they deter businesses - especially small ones - from even attempting to expand cross-border in the EU. The standard VAT return we have proposed today will eliminate this problem, by replacing the 28 diverse national systems with a simple and uniform EU approach. The information required in declaring VAT, and the timelines to do it, will be standardised across Europe. This effectively means that there will be little difference between filing a VAT return abroad and filing one at home. As such, this proposal reflects the true spirit of the Single Market. In addition to considerably easing life for businesses, the standard VAT return also has another major advantage. It goes without saying that simpler rules are easier to follow and easier to enforce. Therefore, the standard declaration should improve VAT compliance across the EU, as taxpayers better understand what's required. The recently published study on the VAT Gap laid bare the catastrophic impact of non-compliance on national revenues. In 2011 alone, uncollected VAT amounted to \u20ac193 billion. I don't claim that such a vast amount can be recaptured simply with this one proposal. The VAT Gap arises from a complex mix of factors, and requires a multi-faceted response. Nonetheless, overly-complicated tax systems are clearly linked to lower levels of tax compliance, even amongst those who wish to play by the rules. So I am confident that the simplifications of the standard VAT return will bear fruit, and that Member States will enjoy increased revenues as result of greater compliance.\nTo conclude, the standard VAT return presents a win-win situation. Businesses will enjoy simpler procedures, reduced costs and less red tape. Governments will have a new tool to facilitate VAT compliance and boost their tax intake.\nToday's proposal therefore supports the EU's core commitments to a business-friendly Single Market and growth-friendly consolidation in the EU."

LIEB/The Associated Press\nJEFFERSON CITY  -  Missouri's main business incentives are getting a makeover.\nGov. Jay Nixon signed legislation Thursday that consolidates four of the state's current incentives into a new program dubbed \"Missouri Works\" that, in some cases, will have easier qualifications for businesses.\nThe measure had been among the priorities that the Democratic governor outlined earlier this year in his State of the State address to the Republican-led legislature.\n\"Streamlining and strengthening our economic development tools will help employers in the Show-Me State create more jobs and ensure that our workforce has the skills they need to compete and win in a global economy,\" Nixon said in a written statement announcing the bill signing.\nThe newly reconfigured program will be modeled after the current \"Quality Jobs\" program, which offers tax breaks to businesses that add a certain number of jobs meeting minimum requirements for wage levels and health benefits.\nBut the new program lowers the number of jobs and the level of wages necessary to qualify for aid. For example, companies in rural or economically distressed areas could qualify for state aid by adding as few as two jobs with wages slightly below the local average, as long as they commit to making a capital investment of at least $100,000 within two years.\nUnder the current Quality Jobs program, businesses in rural areas need to add at least 20 new jobs to qualify  -  and businesses in high-tech fields can qualify with as few as 10 new jobs -  as long as they pay at least average wages.\nThe newly revamped program gives greater discretion to the Department of Economic Development to determine how much money businesses should get. It also consolidates Missouri's current job-training programs.\nThe tax credits offered under Missouri Works will be capped at $106 million during the 2013 fiscal year and gradually rise to $116 million in 2016 and thereafter. That's slightly lower than the combined cap of $128 million annually under the four current incentives being eliminated.\nNixon said the new program will have a streamlined application process and enable more small businesses and rural companies to benefit than the state's current mixture of incentives.\nThe Missouri chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business did not take an active role on the bill but does support it, state director Brad Jones said.\nOther business groups also backed the measure.\n\"Ultimately, the bill will make Missouri more competitive by maximizing our investment,\" said Tracy King, vice president of governmental affairs for the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, adding that \"the money directly helps Missouri workers improve their skills and advance in their careers.\"\nThe current incentive programs phased out by the legislation are the Quality Jobs, Development Tax Credit, Rebuilding Communities and Enhanced Enterprise Zone programs."

Success of populist parties in elections, enormous street demonstrations in Spain, Portugal and other countries and extensive anger over the botched Cyprus bailout all underline the population's growing exhaustion with austerity. \"Meanwhile, Germany's insistence on imposing losses on bank creditors in Cyprus,\" he states, \"is the latest symptom of bailout fatigue in the core. Other core eurozone members, eager to limit the risks to their taxpayers, have similarly signaled that creditor 'bail-ins' are the way of the future.\"\nYet Europe's underlying problems  -  lack of growth, a deep recession, loss of competitiveness and large amounts of private and public debts  -  have not been resolved. \"Outside the eurozone, even the United Kingdom is struggling to restore growth, owing to the damage caused by front-loaded fiscal-consolidation efforts, while anti-austerity sentiment is also mounting in Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary,\" he explains.\n\"[A]mong advanced economies, the U.S. is in the best relative shape, followed by Japan, where Abenomics is boosting confidence. The eurozone and the U.K. remain mired in recessions made worse by tight monetary and fiscal policies,\" Roubini maintains. \"Among emerging economies, China could face a hard landing by late 2014 if critical structural reforms are postponed, and the other BRICs [Brazil, Russia, India and China] need to turn away from state capitalism.

        "webpage": "Report Raises Questions About Central Bank Gold Holdings\nby John Browne Print this article\nFor years I have cautioned that changes in the ownership of gold held in the vaults of key central banks around the globe may not have been accurately reported. A report issued last month in Germany has once again brought these issues to the fore. In today's environment of rampant money creation and questioning of central bank activities, such uncertainty is bound to spark the curiosity of an increasing number of investors.\nSince the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, central banks around the world have increased their gold holdings. As of January of this year, the International Monetary Fund estimated that official reserves had hit a six year high. Most of this growth has come from emerging and developing nations who are estimated to have swollen their gold reserves 25% by weight since 2008. Just a few years ago, India purchased 200 tonnes on offer by the IMF.\nThis increase may surprise those who have been led to believe that central banks do not traditionally accumulate gold during recessions. The fact that they are doing so could carry an important message for private investors.\nThe United States, which has gold holdings of some 8,133.5 tonnes as of 2010 (currently valued at some $420 billion), is still by far the largest holder of gold. Perhaps with deep memories of the social scars of its Weimar Republic, Germany is the world's second largest, with some 3,396 tonnes. Oddly, Germany keeps its horde largely abroad with an estimated 66 percent at the New York Federal Reserve and 21 percent at the Bank of England. The gold was moved out of Germany during the Cold War in the 1950s due to concerns of a potential Russian invasion of West Germany.\nIn late October, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard reported in the UK's Daily Telegraph that the German Court of Auditors told legislators in a redacted report that the German gold held abroad had 'never been verified physically' and ordered the Bundesbank to secure access to the storage sites. The report included the surprise revelation that Germany had slashed the amount of gold held at the Bank of England by two thirds back in 2000 and 2001. At that time, active gold selling by the UK government had apparently made the Germans nervous. Further, Evans-Pritchard reported that the Court called for the repatriation of 150 tonnes of German gold over the next three years to test its weight and quality. The report added fuel to the political movement within Germany to bring back all of its gold reserves. From my perspective, the report also sheds light on three fascinating issues.\nFirst, Germany has increased its gold holdings significantly between 2000 and 2009, more than doubling the percentage of its foreign exchange reserves held in gold. According to 2010 figures of the World Gold Council, Germany's gold reserve now constitutes nearly 74 percent of its foreign exchange reserves. This increase came despite rising storage costs and the massively reduced threat of Russian invasion. What caused Germany to accumulate so much gold? This question should not be lost on investors.\nSecond, the report details a level of central bank cooperation and trust that staggers the imagination. Allied governments appear to have \"trusted\" one another with the stewardship of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of unallocated, and in some cases uninventoried, gold bars. This policy borders on financial negligence.\nThird, some central banks, such as the Fed, publish the total amount of gold held in their inventories. However, they provide no details as to its ownership. It is well known that some countries keep considerable portions of their bullion reserves with the U.S. Fed and with the Bank of England. But the details are lacking.\nFrom 1999 to 2009 central banks drafted and executed three Central Bank Gold Agreements that have the stated intention of coordinating the sale of gold on a global basis. Many private investors see these agreements as simply an attempt to \"demonetize\" gold by creating strategic price volatility, and thereby investment uncertainty. The massive trading required to achieve these desired price movements must have resulted in relative changes to central bank holdings. But as banks do not reveal the owners of their gold deposits, the data is unavailable to prove this.\nIn the coming years, we expect general interest in gold as a store of value to increase while confidence in fiat currencies declines. If this trend is energized by increasing uneasiness over the safety, security, and ownership of the gold held by the world's central banks, much greater volatility could result. If the general breakdown of trust in fiat money is increased suddenly by a sovereign debt crisis like we have seen in Southern Europe, the next action could be a move by central banks to lay more formal claims to their deposits held abroad. Such an eventuality could finally drag the shadowy central bank gold market into the light of day.\nJohn Browne is a Senior Economic Consultant to Euro Pacific Capital.

They were widespread and systematic, and they made such huge progress that in some places they threatened to bring local and state government to its knees. Here we have an aggressive resistance to the New Deal, in the form of some 1500 anti-tax movements in the United States that formed to resist FDR's looting. It's no wonder historians before Beito completely ignored this great movement.\nBeito explores their driving force, the leadership, the ideological basis, their progress and their dealings with the press. He shows how they worked the system to curb tax increases and roll back the taxes in place.\nThe movement has roots in the 1920s boom, when local spending zoomed and taxes did too. Taxpayers were already complaining. But when the Depression hit, the taxes were becoming a crushing burden, and political pressure mounted to repeal them. Governments, however, were strapped for revenue. This dynamic set up a conflict that exploded in protests. The author deals with how the elites and the government (including large corporations) smeared the movement as enemies of the people and society.\nBeito's book reads like a novel, complete with a tragic ending that teaches lessons for the future. Without meaning to give away the ending, the tax-revolt movement was brought down by a vast propaganda campaign, and the promise of good and better government in the future- a naive assumption that the leadership should have seen through. There is so much to learn from here! This is a first-class piece of historical research and writing.\nWhile reading this book, I thought, you could remove the years, 1938..etc.... and replace with 2007-2011! Our history is repeating itself. I do not understand why we do not listen. The author did a pretty good job of telling this story. I think you will be surprised by this book.

But while the lawsuit made this claim on behalf of such employees in all of PwC's main business lines  -  assurance, tax, and advisory  -  the court chose to certify only a portion of the proposed class: associates in the attestation division of the firm's assurance line. All others, including senior associates in the attestation division, will remain ineligible for overtime.\nAt issue in the case, which applies only to PwC's operations in California, is whether the unlicensed employees exercised independent judgment and discretion in performing their duties and whether they performed intellectual work. That will now be decided at trial with respect to the auditing associates.\nIn explaining why it certified only that partial class, the court wrote: \"There appear to be significant differences between the work required by an audit versus the work involved in securing a client's IT infrastructure, or in creating tax provisions for a trust.\" The court also took into account that the lead plaintiffs themselves were in the audit division. \"Regardless of how the issue is framed, the fact remains that plaintiffs have virtually no knowledge of what associates in other divisions do,\" it wrote.\nPwC said in a statement that it \"continues to believe that no class should be certified in this matter. Nonetheless, the firm is gratified the court has rejected plaintiffs' broadly proposed class and has restricted class members only to associates in one practice division. PwC greatly values all of its employees and believes the firm's associates and senior associates are appropriately classified as exempt under California law.\"\nThe court also certified the case for immediate appeal by PwC, and in fact encouraged it because of the complexity of the issues involved. \"There is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and an immediate appeal...will materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,\" the court wrote. PwC said, though, that it has not yet decided whether to appeal.\nA similar case is active in California against Deloitte & Touche. A motion for class certification is expected to be filed in June after depositions and employee surveys have been completed, according to Deloitte attorney Armond Marcarian. The trial is set for October.\nCalifornia has long been considered an employee-friendly state and, as a result, has been the site of several key overtime suits involving white-collar workers. For example, last May a class-action suit was filed in California against IBM by current and former sales representatives who charge the company denied them overtime. However, a judge dismissed the suit because the lead plaintiff reportedly signed a severance agreement promising not to take legal action against the company, noted InformationWeek. In 2006, however, IBM agreed to pay $65 million to more than 32,000 technology specialists to settle charges that it improperly exempted employees from receiving overtime pay.\nOlder suits illustrate the state's relatively long history of legal challenges related to overtime rules. For example, in September 2005, insurer Allstate Corp. announced it would pay as much as $120 million to settle claims that it refused to pay its California employees for working extra hours during nights and weekends. In February of that same year, CFO.com reported that a spate of similar overtime suits hit Silicon Valley companies, including Electronic Arts, Oracle, IBM, and Pacific Software.\nThe rise in overtime suits in the Golden State may have been prompted by the passage of California's 2004 Private Attorneys General Act, which gives employees the right to sue their employers to enforce the state's labor code. What's more, that same year federal labor laws were updated to make several new groups of white-collar workers eligible for overtime pay. The Labor Department now estimates that 86 percent of the U.S. work force, or 115 million employees, is eligible to receive overtime pay, according to a report in BusinessWeek.\n\ufffd CFO Publishing Corporation 2009.

        "webpage": "To Define Profitability, Consider Indirect Benefits\n\nIf you ask seven business professionals to define profitability, you are likely to get seven different answers. There are several ways of viewing profit. In the broad sense, defining profitability is simple: making money. In a more detailed sense, definitions vary depending (for example) on the timeframe and whether indirect benefits are considered.\n\nA profit and loss statement (P&L), captures various levels of quantitative-or \"accounting\"-profit: gross, net, before-tax, and after-tax (See this profit and loss form for an overview).\n\nWhen developing a product or service, it is helpful to generate a pro forma P&L in order to project profit. The true impact of a particular program, however, is often more subjective than the accountants would have you believe.\n\nIndirect Break Even Point Considerations\n\nA profit and loss form can capture the direct revenue and costs associated with a program, but long-term impact, competitive considerations, and indirect benefits to your business can be less tangible.\n\nThe full benefits gained from a marketing program, for example, are not directly and immediately measurable. Many benefits happen over time. Advertising; brand building and awareness; Web site improvements; and other types of programs may be profitable in the long run but appear costly in the short term. A better approach for these programs is to set aside a budget to spend on the program(s) with the most potential for long-term success.\n\nInvestments in improvements-such as a redesign of your Web site-may seem unprofitable at first, but are nonetheless the right thing to do. Many of these programs are beneficial because they keep you from losing business to competitors over time. For these types of projects, the correct question to ask is \"What happens if I do this versus if I do not?\" Know how your business must grow over time to make the improvement worthwhile and compare it to actual growth potential. If the cost is not reasonable compared to the potential, then look for other solutions.\n\nAnother reason the benefits of a marketing program may not be directly measurable is because new customers gained as a result of the program may, over time, buy from you more than once (i.e. have a lifetime value that is greater than the profit from a single purchase). Additionally, happy customers tend to refer additional customers by spreading the word about your goods and services. Both of these factors indirectly increase a marketing program's overall profit.\n\nMaking Revenue and Expense Assumptions\n\nPredicting profitability can be a series of \"best guesses\" based on assumptions. In fact, you could probably manipulate your assumptions to make a program as profitable (or unprofitable) as you wish. A more successful approach, however, is to try to legitimately forecast profit. Be as reasonable as you can with assumptions, and then decrease your expected revenue by some factor (up to 25%). Costs or revenues can come in worse than reasonably expected for a variety of unforeseen reasons.\n\nFiguring Break Even Point\n\nKnowing break even points can help you decide a reasonable budget for your promotional programs. One way to do this-while also taking into account longer term profits-is by basing the break even analysis on lifetime value of new customers (In other words, the amount of profit you expect to earn from new customers gained through the promotion, both now and in the future). To figure this type of break even point, you should know:\n\n1) Program's expected response rate: Defined as the percentage of those exposed to your program that will take you up on your call to action, or become leads. 2) Program's expected conversion rate: The definition of conversion rate is the percentage of responders who actually become customers. 3) Lifetime value of a new customer: The amount of dollar profit you will make from the customer over a certain time period. It is common to define lifetime as anywhere from 18 months to two years.\n\nResponse and conversion rates can vary widely, depending on how targeted your prospects are, how well your offer is written, and how involved the purchase decision. Type of program also has an impact on your response and conversion rates. To estimate these rates for a particular program, you can look to your past experience and/or ask the program vendor. You can also search on general marketing and research Web sites to find rules of thumb for the type of program (you may expect a Website banner ad, for example, to have a much different response rate than a search engine pay per click ad). In all cases, document your assumptions. You will need them later to analyze program results."

PwC and INSEAD Abu Dhabi launched a robust survey focused on the private equity (PE) industry in the MENA region and issued the findings in a report entitled The Next Five Years, MENA PE. The report was based on a series of regional in-depth interviews and online surveys conducted with private equity firms and general partners from leading firms investing in the MENA region. The interviews covered a wide range of topics from the impact of PE firms on the global crises and the recent Middle East protests to new dynamics of the PE industry over the next 5 years. Overall, the report found that the industry remains confident for the remainder of 2011. This sentiment is driven by the fact that the GCC, which is the economic engine of the region, has been largely sheltered from the Middle East protests and prospects for its economic growth remain strong. The research has shown confidence returning to the PE sector in the countries worst hit by the Arab Spring and the global recession. The firms are particularly optimistic about the prospects of sectors such as healthcare, education, consumer goods and oil and gas, which are likely to benefit from government spending plans and regulatory changes. Industries such as railways, toll-ways, ports and utilities are also attractive to investors as they draw billions in capital spending. Commenting on these findings is PwC's leader in Middle East Corporate Finance and Private Equity, Yousef Bazian: \"We conducted this research over a large scale of firms; what's interesting is that findings show PE firms plan expansion outside the region in places like Turkey, India, Sub Saharan Africa, and several firms are even considering riskier markets such as Iraq.\" Yousef goes on to explain: \"Within the region however, PE firms say they are likely to invest more in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.\" However, the report highlighted areas that remain a challenge for the region; in contrast to other emerging markets, the level of fundraising, investments and exits in the MENA region remained well below pre-crisis level, despite the renewed growth of the regional economy. According to the IMF, the MENA's aggregate GDP grew by an estimated 3.8 % in 2010, up from 1.8 % in 2009. But neither the number of new acquisitions nor the number of exits exhibited much sign of recovery from the 2009 lows. Furthermore, the number of exits in percentage terms seemed to exhibit a robust increase of 67% in 2010. However, in absolute terms, the increase was only to a 10 from the incredible low of six recorded in 2009; this number remained far below the peak of 2008 when 24 exits were realised. And in fact, most GP's are delaying exits till 2012 due to the lack of liquidity in local stock markets and the limited appetite among trade buyers. In addition, scarcity of investable companies and limitations on the ability of PE firms to obtain controlling stakes could continue to hamper deal flow. Industry dynamics presented in the report may force PE firms to rethink their way of conducting business, from the way of sourcing companies to value creation, structuring controls and reporting. The political uncertainties affecting some MENA countries may also offer new long term possibilities for PE firms in areas such as small and medium enterprises, Greenfield projects and distressed companies. The report also highlighted regional trends, specifically; Saudi Arabia for example has increasingly enticed PE capital. By 2010, the country moved to second place in the region as a destination for PE investments, up from fourth in 2006. Closely behind as the second largest economy of the MENA region in 2010, the UAE accounted for 17 % of the aggregated MENA GDP, despite its small population. As for Egypt, the IMF anticipates a fall in the rate of GDP growth to 1% from 5.1 % in 2010, given that this projection is based on the assumption that disruptions to tourism, capital flows and financial markets remain short lived, it might even be regarded as optimistic Stephen MEZIAS ,Professor of Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise, INSEAD Abu Dhabi said \"As our findings suggest, the PE industry in the region is confident and remains positive, which signals an era of future growth. We foresee enormous opportunity for those firms that are able to identify these key growth areas and embrace a new way of conducting business.\" Although the boom years of 2007 and 2008 are gone, in a region full of promise and change, PwC and INSEAD's studies show that the long term winners, will be the PE firms who anticipate, if not influence, how the future is being shaped.

But with that growing influence comes increasing scrutiny of their activities by watchdogs such as environmental pressure group Friends of the Earth (FOE), which recently issued a report on the banks' environmental record. The report, \"Time to Go Green: Environmental Responsibility in the Chinese Banking Sector,\" criticized the Chinese banks for failing to adhere to international standards pertaining to the environmental and social impact of their lending practices.\nAccording to the report, produced in association with banking watchdog BankTrack, only two of China's 10 leading banks, including the country's Big Four commercial banks, have publicly disclosed their environmental policies. The two banks were China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China. Even these two banks' policies fall short of international best practices, say BankTrack and FOE, particularly in terms of their overseas financing activities, and their implementation of environmental standards was at times inconsistent.\nThe other eight Chinese banks covered in the report, including names such as the Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China, \"had no publicly available environmental financing standards,\" the report states.\nThe report concluded that environmental financing policies at Chinese banks focused mainly on ensuring clients obeyed environmental laws, which was not consistent with the standards applied by international banks. It pointed to Chinese banks' involvement in environmentally sensitive transactions such as China National Machinery & Equipment Import-Export Corp.'s Kiani Kertas pulp mill in Indonesia.\n\"Chinese banks currently view environmental issues as a matter of charity rather than a core business issue,\" the report's author, Michelle Chan-Fischel of FOE US, stated, adding that this was reminiscent of Western banks' attitudes 10 years ago. BankTrack co-coordinator Johan Frijns went as far as to say that Chinese banks' failure to adhere to environmental financing standards could jeopardize the progress made by the international banking sector. The report called on international banks such as HSBC and Bank of America, which have equity stakes in Chinese banks, to set a good example by encouraging them to institute \"world class\" environmental standards.\nThis article appeared in issue June 2007"

A first report on monitoring progress will be issued by end 2009.\nExtended Global Reach: to further expand its membership and to enshrine the principle that all members enjoy equal footing.\nFaster Agreements: to speed up the process of negotiating and concluding information exchange agreements including exploring new multilateral avenues.\nDeveloping country assistance: to put in place a coordinated technical assistance program to assist smaller jurisdictions to implement the standards rapidly.\nIn its Assessment of Tax Co-operation in 2009 issued on Monday \"OECD assessment shows bank secrecy as a shield for tax evaders coming to an end\") the Global Forum highlighted that the standards on transparency and exchange of information pioneered by the OECD are now almost universally accepted and that extraordinary progress has already been made towards their full implementation.\nThe Global Forum's conclusions will be reported to the G20 Finance ministers who will be meeting in London on 4-5 September and to the meeting of the G20 Leaders Summit in Pittsburgh on 24-25 September.\nThe Forum also agreed on the need to convene regularly, with the next meeting scheduled for 2010.\nThe Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information was created in 2000 to provide an inclusive forum for achieving high standards of transparency and exchange of information in a way that is equitable and permits fair competition between all jurisdictions, large and small, developed and developing.

The 2009 Global Forum meeting was its fifth, the last taking place in 2005.\nIn 2002, Global Forum members worked together to draft a Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters which is now used as a basis for bilateral agreements. Since 2006, the Global Forum has published annual assessments of the legal and administrative frameworks for transparency and exchange of information in more than 80 countries.\nIts most recent assessment, Tax Co-operation 2009: Towards a Level Playing Field based on information available up until 31 July 2009, was published on 31 August 2009.\nSince the London G20 meeting in April, over 50 new Tax Information Exchange Agreements have been signed (doubling the total number of Agreements signed since 2000) and over 40 double taxation conventions have been signed.

        "webpage": "Share Of Cash-out Home Refinancings Decreases In Second Quarter 2004\nMcLean, VA - In the second quarter of 2004, 39 percent of Freddie Mac-owned loans that were refinanced resulted in new mortgages at least five percent higher in amount than the original mortgages, according to Freddie Mac's quarterly refinance review. This is in contrast to the first quarter of 2004, when an adjusted 42 percent of refinanced loans had higher new loan amounts. During the second quarter of 2004, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage (FRM) hovered about six percent, bringing about a gradual slowing of refinance activity. \"The very low interest rates that we saw in March, when 30-year fixed rate mortgage rates averaged 5.4 percent, caused an increase in overall refinancing activity for the loans that closed in the second quarter\" said Amy Crews Cutts, Freddie Mac deputy chief economist. \"When we see regular rate-and-term refinancings increase, the share of cash-out refis drops. Most homeowners are happy to reduce their monthly payments and don't feel a need to withdraw equity, however, lower mortgage rates make home-equity conversion an affordable option for financing other investments such as home improvements or paying for college.\" Freddie Mac expects solid growth in U.S. Gross Domestic Product in the second half of 2004 of between 4 and 5 percent and a continuation of the low core rate of inflation (which excludes the direct impacts of the volatile food and energy components) as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The Federal Reserve Board (Fed) has indicated a change in monetary policy that includes a gradual \"measured\" increase in short-term interest rates. This should have little effect on longer term rates, in particular fixed mortgage rates, because those are more sensitive to inflation rather than to Fed policy. Freddie Mac expects 30-year fixed mortgage rates to average between 6 and 6.5 percent in the second half of 2004 and for the housing market to set a new record for home sales and housing starts.\n\"Higher mortgage rates in the second quarter reduced the refi-share of mortgage applications to 40 percent,\" stated Cutts. \"We expect to see a further reduction in the overall refi share through the second half of 2004 to between 30 and 35 percent. Cash-out refis will make up a larger share of those third and fourth quarter refinancings because most homeowners have already refinanced into very low rate mortgages over the past year. Based on our July outlook for mortgage originations and refi activity in 2004, we expect the amount of home equity cashed-out to total $71 billion. Total equity cashed out in the second quarter was $20 billion, down slightly from the first quarter cash-out amount of $23 billion.\"\nIn the second quarter of this year, the median ratio of old-to-new interest rate was 1.21. In other words, at least half of those who paid off their original loan and took out a new one had an interest rate on their old loan that was 21 percent higher than the new interest rate.\n\"Over the second quarter of 2004, homeowners who refinanced their mortgages lowered their rate on average 0.97 percentage points. On an average loan size of $150,000, that lower rate translates into a payment that is about $94.00 a month lower for a savings of more than $1,100 annually,\" said Cutts.\nThe Cash-Out Refinance Report also revealed that properties refinanced during second quarter 2004 experienced a median house-price appreciation of 6 percent during the time since the original loan was made, unchanged from loans refinanced in first quarter. For loans refinanced in the second quarter of 2004, the median age of the original loan was 1.8 years, nearly two months shorter than the median age of loans refinanced during the first quarter.\nThese estimates come from a sample of properties on which Freddie Mac has funded at least two successive loans. Transactions are further screened to ensure that the latest loan is for refinance rather than for home purchase. The Freddie Mac analysis does not track the use of funds made available from these refinances.\nQUARTERLY REFINANCE STATISTICS\nPercentage of Refinances Resulting in:\n5% Higher Loan Amount1\nLower Loan Amount\nMedian Ratio of Old to New Rate2\nMedian Age of Refinanced Loan (years)\nMedian Appreciation of Refinanced Property\n1Higher loan amount refers to loan amounts that were at least 5 percent greater than the amortized unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the original loan.\n2\"Lower loan amount\" refers to loan amounts that were less than the amortized UPB of the original loan.\nRatio of old to new rate refers to the ratio of the interest rate of the refinanced loan to the interest rate of the new loan.\nSource: Freddie Mac Print Friendly How To Find Us:"

Bernanke Defends Fed Bond Buying\nProgram will spur growth and cut unemployment, Fed chairman says.\nBy Jeff Kearns and Craig Torres, Bloomberg October 2, 2012 \u2022 Reprints\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke defended the Federal Reserve's unprecedented bond buying in his first comments since the Fed renewed the purchases last month, saying the program will spur growth, cut unemployment, help savers and support the dollar.\nThe central bank will sustain record stimulus even after the expansion gains strength, and policy makers don't expect the economy to remain weak through 2015, Bernanke said today in a speech in Indianapolis. The U.S. probably won't fall back into a recession even with growth too weak to reduce a jobless rate stuck above 8 percent since February 2009, he said in response to an audience question.\n\"We expect the economy to continue to grow,\" Bernanke said to the Economic Club of Indiana. \"Our concern is not really a recession. Our concern is that growth will continue but at a pace that's insufficient to put people back to work.\"\nBernanke, 58, stood behind his unconventional policies by saying the late Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman \"would have supported what we are doing.\" The Federal Open Market Committee said last month it will keep the main interest rate near zero until at least mid-2015 and buy $40 billion of mortgage debt a month in a third round of quantitative easing until the labor market shows \"sustained improvement.\"\n\"We expect that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economy strengthens,\" Bernanke said in the speech. Still, policy makers' forecast for the main interest rate \"doesn't mean that we expect the economy to be weak through\" mid-2015, Bernanke said.\nWhile payrolls are expanding, economic growth of 1.5 percent to 2 percent \"is not fast enough to lower the unemployment rate\" because it only keeps up with the number of new entrants into the labor force, he said.\nCentral bank policies to boost growth should not damage the value of the dollar on foreign currency markets, Bernanke said. The dollar \"is about where it was before the crisis,\" and pursuing maximum employment and low and stable inflation will make the U.S. currency attractive, he said.\nAlso, Fed easing, including the zero-interest-rate policy, will help savers by fueling the expansion, Bernanke said. \"Only a strong economy can create higher asset values and sustainably good returns for savers.\"\nBernanke, a scholar of the Great Depression, has deployed the most aggressive monetary policies since the Fed's founding nearly a century ago as he battled the financial crisis, helped pull the nation out of the worst recession since the 1930s and sought to keep the expansion going.\nMore Assets\nBernanke expanded the balance sheet to $2.8 trillion from around $877 billion in August 2007. He also changed the composition of the Fed's balance sheet, purchasing mortgage-backed securities to help lower yields for housing finance.\nThe Fed has taken \"very much to heart\" the conclusions of Friedman and Anna Schwartz, whose 1963 book, \"A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960,\" said the Depression was triggered by monetary tightening and the collapse of the banking system, Bernanke said.\n\"We were aggressive early on, we didn't allow the fact that interest rates were very low to fool us into thinking that monetary policy was as accommodative as it needed to be, and we were aggressive, as you know, in trying to prevent the collapse of the banking system,\" Bernanke said. \"Those are all things that Friedman would have supported.\"\nBernanke's reference to Friedman aligns with decades of his research into monetary policy during the Depression.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\nTORONTO - Canada has violated the charter rights of nearly a million Canadians by agreeing to share their financial details with authorities in the United States, two Ontario women allege in a new lawsuit.Gwen Deegan of Toronto and Ginny Hillis of Windsor, Ont., have launched a claim against the Attorney General of Canada.In it, they accuse Ottawa of breaching the Constitution by complying with a sweeping new American tax fraud law, known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Story continues below\nUnder the terms of the legislation that took effect last month, banks must share all personal and joint account details of anyone deemed to be a \"U.S. person.\" This includes American citizens and people born in the U.S., even those with no existing ties to the country.The U.S. claims that more than 77,000 financial institutions around the world have agreed to co-operate with the law.In Canada, financial institutions must share relevant account holder details, including personal details and financial balances, with the Canada Revenue Agency. The CRA will in turn pass that information along to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.Hillis and Deegan, both of whom were born in the U.S. but have lived in Canada since the age of five, claim Canada is exposing them and others in similar circumstances to unfair tax penalties and privacy violations by complying with the U.S. government's demands.\"I don't believe that my rights as a Canadian citizen should be abrogated by my government,\" Hillis said in an interview from Windsor. \"I don't believe my government should be breaching our sovereignty rights as a nation ... We are a sovereign nation, we are not the 51st state of the United States.\"Hillis, a retired lawyer who holds Canadian citizenship, said those who resist the new regulations could be branded as official tax cheats by the U.S. government.Failure to comply with the laws, she said, could result in stiff financial penalties or even jail time.A large number of Canadians are impacted by the law, she said, since FATCA's definition of a \"U.S. person\" is extremely broad and applies even to those who do not hold an American passport and have never worked in the country.But Hillis also fears for Canadians who hold joint accounts with people targeted by FATCA.Joint account details are also fair game for the IRS, she said, adding that people like her husband may be at risk of having personal information shared across the border.David Gruber, a lawyer with Farris, Vaughan, Wills & Murphy LLP who is helping to lead the case, agrees that FATCA has broader implications.\"It's the account information itself that would be relayed by CRA to the IRS, so indirectly all parties are facing the same issue,\" he said. \"The non-U.S. person would presumably not have any potential liability to the U.S., but nevertheless, they would have the intrusion of their privacy.\"Gruber said the lawsuit is arguing that the federal government has breached the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in three ways - by violating affected people's right to liberty and security, by failing to protect them from unreasonable search and seizure, and by discriminating against them on the grounds of their country of birth.\"There's a distinction drawn in the law between Canadian citizens who fall within this definition of a U.S. person and other Canadian citizens, in that the first class of people have this intrusion into their privacy ... and the other class will not,\" he said. \"That differential treatment of Canadian citizens, we say, is discriminatory.\"It's this last point that rankles with Hillis, who feels let down by the country she calls home.\"I'm shocked at the United States, but I'm heartbroken that Canada considers me a second-class citizen.\"Canada's financial industry has a powerful incentive to co-operate with FATCA regulations.Under the law, foreign banks that don't agree to share information with the IRS face steep penalties when doing business in the U.S. The law requires American banks to withhold 30 per cent of certain payments to foreign banks that don't participate in the program - a significant price for access to the world's largest economy.The Justice Department could not be reached for comment on the suit.

Many, viewing the dismal inflation-consumed performance of the 1980s and early 1990s, with a currency adding zeros faster than the printing presses could turn, believed Brazil could never make it, especially with a former sociology professor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, becoming president followed by a leftist populist, the present president, Lula. But indeed it is happening.\nCardoso practised fiscal prudence, stabilized the currency, and initiated the first real reforms of Brazil's bloated bureaucracy and feudal inefficiencies. Lula, to everyone's surprise  -  a mere six month's before his election he was calling for Brazil to renege on its debts  -  continued the process.\nBrazil under Lula has recently repaid its debts to the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club well ahead of schedule. It is running a fast growing surplus on its trade account, its exports are booming, growing at a faster rate than China's  -  in a range of products from soy to aircraft from mining to computers. Its economy is growing steadily at around 3 to 3.5 percent.\nThis is happening in a country that is the world's fifth largest both in population and size. It is highly industrialized country with over 80 percent of its people urbanized. The city of S\u00e3o Paulo's economy is larger than the whole of Argentina's.\nMoreover, Brazil is home to the world's largest tropical forest and Brazil has the world's largest reservoirs of freshwater and ample hyrdo electric power. It is self-sufficient in oil and gas. Brazil has a head start on India and China. It has been developing in its sometime madcap way for over 100 years. Between 1960 and 1980 Brazil doubled its per capita income, an achievement that was only surpassed by the later growth spurts of the East Asian countries. Its income per head is almost $8000 (in purchasing power parity). This compares with China's $4,500 and India's $3000. If this doesn't give Brazil's economy with its 170 million people almost quite the clout as India's and China's with their billion people each, it certainly gives it a base to stand eye to eye with them in say 50 years' time, when their growth rates will inevitably have long slowed and Brazil's should have cruised for two generations at a comfortable 5 percent. At the very least Brazil will outgrow Canada, pace Russia and leave Mexico way behind.\nMs. Roussef says if Lula wins re-election in October, tax rates will come down, interest rates will continue to fall and there will be a public/private push to invest in a substantial increase in Brazil's energy, steel and paper sectors. There will be increased financing for construction and housing and inflation will stay under control.\nShe readily accepts what the World Bank has said of Brazil  -  \"there is increasing evidence that inequality adversely affects growth, undermines, social cohesion and increases crime.\" So Lula will continue to expand his income transfer program and will focus his energy on reforming the country's moribund and inefficient education system.\nHis principal rival for the presidency, Jos\u00e9 Serra, the mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, will trump all this, or so he says, partly because he, as a well known fiscal conservative throughout his long political career, will have more credibility with the financial markets and thus can afford to significantly increase the growth rate and partly, less beholden to the indulgence of the US than Lula has been forced to be as a one time Marxist-consorting leftist, he can up the ante on trade negotiations, confronting Washington to open up its protected markets.\nBrazil has a good chance of emerging as the world's first economic superpower without nuclear weapons  -  on which there is a consensus in all political corners. It hasn't been to war for 135 years. It is the most tolerant of countries, one that never had Jim Crow laws and which abolished capital punishment in 1885. If Brazil succeeds it can only make the world a better place."

        "webpage": "State | Nation | World\nOur Hometown\nFaith Brief\nPayday lending industry pushes for return\nRALEIGH  -  A dozen years after North Carolina became the first state to outlaw short-term, high-cost payday lending, legislators and lobbyists are pushing for the industry's return, promising protections to prevent borrowers from sinking into a cycle of debt.\nThe industry was outlawed in 2001 after a four-year experiment, but it wasn't until 2006 that the last payday lenders finally shut down. North Carolina lawmakers of both parties have periodically pushed to bring payday lending back to the state.\nThe industry this year has pumped up its efforts, hiring 10 lobbyists including former state House Speaker Harold Brubaker, R-Randolph, and former state Republican Party Chairman Tom Fetzer.\nRepublican Gov. Pat McCrory hasn't taken a position on payday lending. He came into office this year promising to treat businesses as state government's customer, hoping that will create an environment for companies to grow, a sentiment largely shared by the GOP-led General Assembly.\nPayday loans are small, short-term loans with fees that  -  when described on an annual basis, as most loans are  -  can amount to several hundred percent. The new North Carolina legislation would allow lenders to charge up to 15 percent in fees for loans of up to $500, for a maximum of $75. The industry's supporters say the higher costs to borrowers are justified because payday loans are risky.\nSupporters also say payday loans offer a reasonable, government-regulated option for people desperately in need of cash with nowhere else to turn. Consumer advocates say the loans and fees can trap consumers in debt as new loans are borrowed to replace old ones.\nThe average customer of leading payday lender Advance America takes eight such loans in a year, according to the Spartanburg, S.C., company's annual report.\nNorth Carolina's banking commissioner reported in 2001 that one in seven borrowers turned to a payday lender at least 19 times a year, or nearly every two weeks. At that frequency, the borrowers paid back at least three times more in fees over a year than the amount they borrowed.\nLisa Engelkins, 42, of Winston-Salem has seen both pros and cons of payday loans. She said she was a single mother in her 20s, struggling to collect child support, when the major bank she worked for turned her down for an unsecured personal loan.\n\"There wasn't quite enough to get me to the next payday,\" Engelkins said.\nShe said she borrowed $255 from a payday lender in 1998. But the fees added up, and her earning power lagged. As one loan rolled into another, she wound up paying more than $1,200 in fees over the next three years, Engelkins said. She said she paid off the loan two years later.\nNow Engelkins is a credit counselor trying to help struggling families with foreclosure and credit card debt and says she could see herself alongside some of her clients, returning to a payday lender.\n\"There's always going to be something that comes up. There's going to be an emergency,\" Engelkins said. \"If I had a dire emergency, and I have no other method, then I would probably do the same thing if I had to.\"\nConsumer advocates note that some North Carolina banks and all credit unions offer unsecured personal loans for less. North Carolina's largest credit union, the State Employees Credit Union, charges customers 12 percent for a salary advance loan.\nAbout 9 percent of North Carolina households have no bank accounts and operate mostly in cash .\nAdvance America senior vice president Jamie Fulmer said consumers should have the choice of a payday loan when the gas bill is due, rather than face late fees, overdraft charges or utility reconnection costs.\n\"The payday loan is not unlike other credit products out there,\" Fulmer said. \"There are inherent risks. Customers must be careful. They must carefully consider all their choices, and then they must make the decision that's best for them.\"\nBill sponsors Sens. Jerry Tillman, R-Randolph; Clark Jenkins, D-Edgecombe; and Sen. Tom Apodaca, R-Henderson, said they think the little guy should choose where to borrow when in need.\n\"We have cut out those folks that do not have a credit card or access to any money, and believe me they are getting the money elsewhere\" like online lenders, Apodaca said. \"So if we're going to have it, we might as well regulate it.\"\nThe sponsors promise a law legalizing payday loans that prevents the abuses of the past and keeps out financial predators.\nBut opponents, including Attorney General Roy Cooper, don't believe it. Retired Navy Adm. Steve Abbot, president of the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, said in a letter to lawmakers last week that high-cost loans harm military readiness and add to financial stresses that can undermine a security clearance.\nApodaca, who has long supported resuming payday lending, responded: \"I can say the admiral has never had to borrow $500 and not had access to it.\"\nNCCARZ\n\u00a9 2015 The Daily Dispatch\n304 S.

He focuses his active practice on publicly and privately held growth companies in addition to representing mezzanine finance providers and equity participants.\nIn many years, family offices, which consist of a staff of professionals who manage the assets of one or more families, allocated a portion of those assets to investing in either fund of funds for private equity firms  -  those firms that would invest in a number of private equity firms under one fund umbrella  -  or directly in individual private equity firms.Today, a new situation is evolving. Many large family offices have made the decision that investing in either fund of funds or individual private equity firms is not desirable in that one is investing in blind pools that seldom make any investments from the new funds at the time of the investment.The thought is why invest in a blind pool, even if the private equity firm has a historically excellent return record, rather than directly investing in companies? To go it alone, larger family offices have been hiring away from private equity firms many of their best managing directors to run direct investments.Our own firm, very active on a national basis in private equity firm representation both in fund formation and transactional work, has seen a number of managing directors take these new positions despite the fact that they have had very successful careers with their private equity firm. The optimal execution of such a plan by a family office is to have the infrastructure not only to make the investment directly and work with the target business (be it on a control or non-control basis), but also to have enough assets dedicated to these direct investments to compensate and incent these managing directors.The alternative to creating this infrastructure, and a circumstance that we are seeing more, is for the family office not to undertake this costly endeavor but rather to make it known to the investing world that it will entertain the approach of fundless sponsors (now known as independent sponsors) who do not have a committed capital fund but do have ongoing deal sourcing abilities and will be looking for two or three funders of their deals. As a result, we've seen many more independent sponsor groups spawned in the past several years and we have introduced some of these groups to those family offices who are receptive.What can private equity firms do to counter this ongoing trend? Obviously, historically excellent cash-on-cash returns will cause a family office to think twice about going to the managing director mode. Another structural change we have seen in certain private equity firms that we represent is to change from a committed capital fund to a pledge fund, the difference being that rather than committing the full amount of capital to invest over a five-year period after fund formation, the investor commits a much smaller amount of annual capital and is allowed to choose to invest in each deal presented to it. As such, it is not a blind pool. We have seen this prove successful for certain private equity firms, including new private equity firms. The vast preponderance of those limited partner investors in the pledge fund commit to each deal as it arises. So what does this do to private equity firms that have grown up with committed capital raises that are usually blind pools? It creates more bidders for a company where an auction process is taking place, but there are already many, many bidders given the amount of uninvested cash from both strategic and financial bidders. It also will take some of the investors away from fund of funds or committed capital funds as family offices opt to invest directly.What remains to be seen is whether these family offices will have the infrastructure and industry expertise to really actively participate in the sellers' market given that many private equity firms are very bench strength strong as experts in certain industries. And remember, many firms have a solid core team of investors who have worked together for many years. That is a large advantage."

        "webpage": "HomeAP - Entertainment\nHow Sweden recovered, and what Europe could learn\nBy C. FRED BERGSTEN Special to The Washington Post\nPublished: Tuesday, September 3, 2013 at 1:00 a.m.\nLast Modified: Friday, August 30, 2013 at 7:40 p.m.\nEurope has been the source of unremitting gloom and doom for four years. The euro crisis has threatened the global economy. Most Americans, and many Europeans, have become exasperated with European nations' failure to respond decisively to their troubles.\nSo it is a refreshing -- and brilliant -- decision by President Obama to visit Sweden and meet with Scandinavian prime ministers en route to this week's Group of 20 summit in Russia. Sweden escaped the crisis in its neighborhood, and it quickly restored steady and stable growth. It presents a proven model for the types of reforms needed in much of Europe and many other parts of the world, including the United States, and Obama should carry this success story to the full G-20.Sweden was the world's third-richest country in 1968 but became a massive welfare state in the 1970s and 1980s and a prototype for how not to run an economy. It slid to No. 17 in the global income rankings and experienced a deep financial and real estate crisis in 1991, according to a 2012 study from the Research Institute of Industrial Economics. To its enormous credit, Sweden reversed course with consummate skill and political courage; it has become a paragon of sensible economic and social policy.Sweden's economic growth has been much higher than that of the rest of Western Europe, or the United States, since 2006.Data from the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that Sweden has one of the lowest inflation rates in Europe; it runs a budget surplus every year; its corporate tax rates are considerably lower than U.S. rates; and it spends more on research and development, as a share of its economy, than we do. Its firms are highly competitive in the world economy, and it runs sizable current-account surpluses.After its crisis, Sweden reduced public expenditures by 20 percent of its gross domestic product, slashing social transfers such as unemployment benefits and sick-leave compensation. It cut its public debt in half (its debt, as a proportion of the economy, is now about half that of the United States). It cut marginal tax rates and simplified its tax code so much that nearly two-thirds of Swedes simply confirm by phone that the declaration automatically prepared for them by the tax authorities is correct. The banking system was thoroughly reformed and emerged unscathed from the global financial crises.Structural reforms were also adopted. Successive governments deregulated one market after another and privatized as market conditions permitted. All children receive vouchers so their parents can choose private or public schools at public expense.Swedish social security became a true insurance system, rather than a pay-as-you-go one with huge unfunded liabilities as in the United States.Sweden remains a social welfare society, and government spending still accounts for half of its economy; it finances all education and health care, as is common throughout Europe. Sweden did not dismantle the social system but, in addition to drastically reducing its costs, adopted macroeconomic and structural reforms to make it sustainable and greatly enhanced its efficiency by privatizing the delivery of many educational and medical services. The country's guiding principle is that a successful social welfare society must be fiscally conservative and administratively efficient. This is the central Swedish lesson for the crisis countries of the euro zone and elsewhere.These policies, based on competition and openness, have been implemented and endorsed by most Swedish political parties. They also enjoy an intellectual consensus. The Social Democrats continued the reforms initiated by the center-right and even added a few. The metalworkers' union accepted major wage cuts at the height of the global crisis to protect its long-run prosperity, and its leader became chairman of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. In 2010, the government was handily re-elected while most European governments were falling because of the crisis. Sweden's Anders Borg was named Europe's top finance minister for 2011 by the Financial Times.Sweden now combines a social welfare society with a free-market economy and a high degree of government efficiency. The other Scandinavian countries pursue similar policies and have enjoyed similar success (if not quite as spectacular). This subregion of stability demonstrates that, with the right policies, European countries can prosper inside the euro zone (Finland, de facto Denmark) or outside it (Sweden and Norway).Obama should highlight their progress and convey this message of successful reform to his G-20 counterparts in St. Petersburg.C.

        "webpage": "Republicans defensive as experts question fiscal policy - Taipei Times\nRepublicans defensive as experts question fiscal policy\nNY Times, News Service, Washington\nThe boasts of congressional Republicans about their cost--cutting victories are ringing hollow to some well-known economists, financial analysts and corporate leaders, including some Republicans, who are expressing increasing alarm over Washington's new austerity.Their critiques have grown sharper since US President Barack Obama signed his deficit reduction deal with Republicans and, a few days later, when Standard & Poor's (S&P) downgraded the credit rating of the US.However, even before that, macroeconomists and private sector forecasters were warning that the direction in which the new House Republican majority had pushed the White House and Congress this year  -  for immediate spending cuts, no further stimulus measures and no tax increases, ever  -  was the wrong one for addressing the nation's two main ills, a weak economy now and projections of unsustainably high federal debt in coming years.Instead, these critics say, Washington should be focusing on stimulating the economy in the near term to induce people to spend money and create jobs, while simultaneously settling on a long-term plan for paying down federal debts.There is broad disagreement among economists about the proper balance between spending cuts and tax increases in reducing a government's debts.Some studies by both liberal and conservative economists suggest that emphasizing spending cuts is better for long-term growth, but there are few if any precedents for paying down such a large debt solely through spending cuts.Among those calling for a mix of cuts and revenues are onetime standard-bearers of Republican economic philosophy like Martin Feldstein, an adviser to former US president Ronald Reagan, and Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary to former president George W. Bush, underscoring the deepening divide between party establishment figures and the Tea Party-inspired Republicans in Congress and running for the White House.\n\"I think the US has every chance of having a good year next year, but the politicians are doing their damnedest to prevent it from happening  -  the Republicans are  -  and the Democrats to my eternal bafflement have not stood their ground,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist for High Frequency Economics, a research firm, said in an interview.As for the longer term, Ethan Harris, who is co-head of global economics research at Bank of America, wrote last week: \"Given the scale of the debt problem, a credible plan requires both revenue enhancement measures and entitlement reform. Washington's recent debt deal did not include either.\"That is a common assessment, which may explain why Representative Eric Cantor, the House of Representatives' majority leader, was defensive about Republicans' anti-tax absolutism in a memo to his colleagues on Monday last week.\"Over the next several months, there will be tremendous pressure on Congress to prove that S&P's analysis of the inability of the political parties to bridge our differences is wrong,\" Cantor wrote.\"In short, there will be pressure to compromise on tax increases,\" he wrote.However, he added: \"We were not elected to raise taxes or take more money out of the pockets of hardworking families and business people.\"Although many forecasters criticize S&P for downgrading the US, they share the company's disappointment that the budget deal fell short of the \"grand bargain\" Obama tried to negotiate with House Speaker John Boehner to provide stimulus and cut annual deficits up to US$4 trillion over 10 years."

        "webpage": "Report: States force jobless to pay needless fees\nPosted: Tuesday, January 29, 2013 9:13 am\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Jobless Americans are paying millions in unnecessary fees to collect unemployment benefits because of state policies encouraging them to get the money through bank-issued payment cards, according to a new report from a consumer group.\nPeople are using the fee-heavy cards instead of getting their payments deposited directly to their bank accounts. That's because states issue bank cards automatically, require complicated paperwork or phone calls to set up direct deposit and fail to explain the card fees, according to a report issued Tuesday by the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit group that seeks to protect low-income Americans from unfair financial-services products. An early copy of the report was obtained by The Associated Press.\nUntil the past decade, states distributed unemployment compensation by mailing out paper checks. Some also allowed direct deposit. The system worked well for people who had bank accounts and could deposit the check without paying a fee.\nIt also cost states millions of dollars each year to print and mail the checks.\nBanks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America Corp. seized on government payments as a business opportunity. They pitched card programs to states as a win-win: States would save millions in overhead costs because the cards would be issued for free. And people without bank accounts would avoid the big fees charged by storefront check cashers.\nHowever, most of the people being hit with fees already have bank accounts. The bank-state partnerships effectively shifted the cost of distributing payments from governments to individuals. The money needed to cover those costs is deducted from people's unemployment benefits in the form of fees.\nConsumer advocates like NCLC are focused on ensuring access to the direct-deposit option so that people can avoid the card fees.\nThe trouble, the new report says, is that many states make it difficult for people to sign up for direct deposit. The rate of people using direct deposit ranges from a national high of 82 percent in Minnesota to a low of 16 percent in Arizona, the report says.\nMinnesota offers direct deposit to people when they apply for benefits, and allows them to change their payment method online or over the phone, the report says.\nIn Arizona, by contrast, people are automatically enrolled in the card program. After they receive the card, they must find a paper form, fill it out, and submit it by mail. There is no way to change payment methods online or over the phone.\n\"The difference in direct-deposit rates among states seems primarily due to how hard or easy the state makes it for workers to choose direct deposit,\" the report says.\nIn five states - California, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland and Nevada - unemployed people aren't offered direct deposit at all. The report says that setup is illegal under a federal law that bars states from requiring benefits recipients to open an account at a particular bank.\nThe federal government recommended in 2009 that people with bank accounts receive payments via direct deposit. Nearly four years later, the report says, \"there is no excuse for any state not to be offering direct deposit as the first choice for payment of unemployment benefits.\"\nBanks make more money when more people use the cards. In the past, some of their deals with states prevented states from offering direct deposit, or required states to promote the card program as a first option.\nTo cover the cost of issuing cards and running the programs, banks charge a plethora of fees, including charges for balance inquiries, phone calls to customer support, leaving an account inactive for a period of months, or making a purchase using a personal identification number.\nMany states have eliminated some fees and improved consumer protections in the two years since NCLC published its first comprehensive review of state unemployment payments. Banks no longer charge overdraft fees, which skimmed up to $20 from the benefits of card users whose spending exceeded the balance on the card.\nPennsylvania was singled out for praise in the report. Residents of that state will save $5.2 million in card fees each year because the state switched to a lower-fee card.\nIn part because of the recent improvements, the report says, prepaid cards often are the best option for people who don't have bank accounts. Those people would often pay even bigger fees to storefront check cashing services.\n\"A well-designed prepaid card is safer, cheaper and more convenient than paying to cash a paper check,\" said Lauren Saunders, one of the report's authors, in a prepared statement. But she said \"it is no substitute for direct deposit to an account of your own choosing.\"\nDaniel Wagner can be reached at  .\nTuesday, January 29, 2013 9:13 am.\nVideo Clip: ABC 7 News at 6pm for Sept. 9 - ABC 7 covers the latest local News and Weather on the Florida Suncoast including Sarasota and Manatee counties.

Shares of tax expert H&R Block were higher Tuesday, and it is likely to be a beneficiary of Washington's handling of the tax issues associated with the \"cliff,\" no matter what the outcome, analysts say. BTIG analyst Mark Palmer, in a note Tuesday, said investors are needlessly worrying that H&R Block would be negatively impacted if Congress simplifies the tax code. (Read More: Fix the 'Cliff' and 'Ton of Cash' Gets Freed Up.)\nPalmer said despite the fact that President Barack Obama has called on Congress to reform the tax code and make it fair and simple, the barriers to that are too high to make it a likely outcome. \"While the president has proposed a few carve-outs for elimination, they wouldn't simplify the tax system in a way that would really matter - or be a meaningful threat to demand for HRB's services,\" he noted in a report. BTIG rates H&R Block a \"buy.\"\n\"While we certainly understand why an outcome that would have a potentially devastating effect on the company would be part of one's analysis, we also believe that the probability of meaningful tax simplification in the current political context is insignificant,\" Palmer writes. John Stoltzfus, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said H&R is one of the names on his favorites list because he expects it to benefit from tax payer confusion and adjustment to whatever changes are made. The fiscal cliff is the double whammy the economy would feel from the onset Jan. 1 of about $500 billion in taxes and $100 billion in automatic spending cuts if Congress does not act. The Real Cost of the 'Fiscal Cliff'\nCNBC's Gary Kaminsky talks about the cost to business of implementing health care and tax reform, with Peter Baum, Essex Manufacturing Inc. CFO & COO.\nObama and Democrats have favored restoring the top tax rates, reduced in the Bush era. Republicans oppose raising rates, and there is talk that eliminating deductions would be a potential compromise. And in illustrating his comments, Palmer points to the fact that there were just 400 pages when the modern federal income tax code was first imposed in 1913. That number grew to 8,200 in 1945, and by 2011 it ballooned to 72,316 pages. Palmer also detailed some of the 70 tax breaks that expired last Dec. 31 and have not been renewed. They include an additional 34 million taxpayers facing the alternative minimum tax, meaning many who receive tax refunds could instead face a tax bill. Also at risk are the state and local sales tax deduction, affecting residents of states with no income tax; tuition and fees deduction, worth about $4,000 per college student and mortgage insurance, deductible as residence interest. (Read More: It's 'Simply Not Going to Happen': Sen. Corker.)\nHe says there is peril for H&R Block in the potential for refunds to be delayed if Congress allows the U.S. to go over the cliff, but there is also opportunity in the resulting confusion. \"A taxpayer who might have been inclined to purchase and use Intuit's TurboTax in a normal year - one in which tax law was essentially unchanged and he anticipated a refund - may be more inclined to seek the assistance of an HRB preparer when he's trying to find ways to reduce or avert a tax bill,\" Palmer wrote. If Congress lets the U.S. go over the cliff, it may later try to undo some of the automatic tax changes, such as the expansion of the AMT. That could delay the tax season, and that would impact timing of H&R Block revenues, possibly moving more into the August quarter from the traditional April 30 quarter, Palmer noted. H&R stock is up about 8 percent in the past three months. On Tuesday, the company announced a dividend of 20 cents per share, payable Jan. 2 (payable two days after Bush era tax breaks on dividend taxes expire). In October, the company said it was exploring strategic alternatives for H&R Block Bank that could result in H&R no longer being regulated by the Federal Reserve as a savings and loan holding company. The Fed in June announced proposals to impose higher capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies. Follow Patti Domm on Twitter: @pattidomm\nQuestions? Comments?

        "webpage": "Income inequality in America\nWorsening wealth inequality by raceBy Tami Luhby @CNNMoney\nJune 21, 2012: 1:09 PM ET The Great Recession has widened the wealth gap, and race is a major factor.NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- White Americans have 22 times more wealth than blacks -- a gap that nearly doubled during the Great Recession.The median household net worth for whites was $110,729 in 2010, versus $4,995 for blacks, according to recently released Census Bureau figures.\nThe difference is similarly notable when it comes to Hispanics, who had a median household net worth of $7,424. The ratio between white and Hispanic wealth expanded to 15 to 1.The gap between the races widened considerably during the recent economic downturn, which whites weathered better than blacks, Hispanics and Asians.The latter three groups saw their median household net worth fall by roughly 60% between 2005 and 2010, while the median net worth for white households slipped only 23%.This allowed whites to leap ahead of Asians as the race with the highest median household net worth.CNN iReport: Are you feeling the drop in net worth?The racial wealth divide is nothing new. Black and Hispanic Americans have historically had lower incomes, higher unemployment and less education.That makes it more difficult for these groups to save money and put their capital to work building wealth, said Tatjana Meschede, research director of the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University.The Great Recession exacerbated the problem. In 2005, the net worth difference wasn't quite as stark. Whites had 12 times more wealth than blacks and 8 times more than Hispanics.The main reason blacks and Hispanics did not fare as well during the economic downturn is that home equity makes up more of their wealth than it does for whites. The housing bubble that preceded the collapse pushed up homeownership rates among blacks and Hispanics, who relied more heavily on high-cost subprime loans to finance their purchases.As a result, the implosion of the real estate market had a more devastating impact on black and Hispanic communities. Asians, meanwhile, are more concentrated on the West Coast, which was hit harder by the mortgage meltdown. And the arrival of new Asian immigrants in the last decade contributed to the decline in overall wealth, according to Rakesh Kochhar, co-author of the Pew Research Center report on wealth. Pew found that in 2005, home equity made up nearly two-thirds of the net worth of Hispanics and 59% of blacks, but only 44% of whites.Blacks and Hispanics are also less likely to have assets in the financial system, such as savings accounts or stocks, Kochhar said.And these groups also suffer from far higher unemployment rates than whites, whose unemployment rate is 7.4%, below the national average. Blacks, on the other hand, have a 13.6% unemployment rate and Hispanics, 11%.0:00\n/1:04The super rich sound off on the wealth gapThe widened wealth chasm could have major ramifications going forward, experts said.Having less wealth and home equity means it will be more difficult for blacks and Hispanics to send their children to college, which gives them a leg up on landing good jobs, said Roderick Harrison, senior research scientist at Howard University. That will further extend the wealth gap.\"The implications will be with us into the next generation, which will have greater difficulty in getting the kinds of jobs needed to start saving and building wealth,\" Harrison said.

        "webpage": "When a mutual fund says it doesn't want your money\nNEW YORK -- \"No thanks.\"\nThat's what a growing number of mutual fund managers are telling investors who want to hand over their money, and it's occurring just as many investors are getting comfortable with stocks again.\nThe market is at a record high, and more than 300 mutual funds have closed their doors to anyone who wants to put money in the fund for the first time. The funds run a wide range, specializing in everything from short-term U.S. bonds to dividend-paying Asian stocks. Of the 315 funds closed to new investors, 56 made the move during the first seven months of 2013, according to data from Morningstar. That compares with 49 for all of 2012 and 53 for all of 2011.\nIt's actually an encouraging trend, at least for those already in the funds, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ. \"Funds close to new investors for good reasons,\" he says. \"They want to make sure they protect existing shareholders.\"\nMutual fund companies could earn bigger profits by keeping their doors open, because it means more assets on which managers can collect fees. But having too much money can make managing the fund more difficult. Stock pickers may run out of ideas they feel strongly about. Managers who specialize in small-cap stocks could also see their ownership stakes get too large in individual companies if they continue pumping money into their favorites. That could make selling them later more difficult.\n\"It's nice to hear that the industry that has been criticized for being greedy is doing things that are taking the interest of shareholders to heart,\" says Morty Schaja, chief executive officer of RiverPark Funds. His company's RiverPark Short Term High Yield fund (RPHYX) closed to new investors in June.\n\"It's like we're in the business of selling cars, and all of a sudden, we don't want to sell any more cars because there's too much traffic,\" Schaja says.\nMuch of the RiverPark Short Term High Yield fund is invested in a relatively small section of the market: bonds issued by companies with weak credit ratings that are scheduled to be repaid over the next month. When the fund launched in 2010, Schaja says the team thought it could comfortably handle $700 million to $1 billion. \"After that, it's harder to invest the money.\"\nThe fund now has about $789 million, according to Morningstar, as demand ballooned for bonds with higher yields that are less sensitive to moves in interest rates.\nInvestors have been getting more comfortable with stock mutual funds recently as well. They put more money into stock funds than they took out for five straight months from January through May, according to the Investment Company Institute, which represents the fund industry. It's the first time that has happened in more than two years, though investors pulled a modest amount out in June.\nThe increased flow of dollars and big gains for stocks this year have pushed assets for many stock mutual funds higher. Indexes that measure big, medium and small-sized stocks all set record highs in July.\nThe BBH Core Select (BBTEX) fund closed to new investors in November, before that run. It was for a simple reason, says Jeff Schoenfeld, a partner at Brown Brothers Harriman: Its managers are choosy and want to remain that way.\nThe fund has several criteria that companies must pass before the fund will invest, and it typically can identify only about 25 to 30 at a time. Companies must sell an essential product or service, have loyal customers and have a stock price that's at least 25 percent below where the managers think it should be, for example. The fund owns big companies, such as Berkshire Hathaway, Comcast and Google.\n\"If you do the math, it leads you to the conclusion that after you reach about $20 billion, you would either own too much of any one company or you'd have to begin diversifying and own a larger number of companies,\" Schoenfeld says.\nTo be sure, the decision to close the fund and protect existing shareholders wasn't entirely selfless. \"The investment team who work here are invested themselves,\" Schoenfeld says.\nAsked if the fund ideally would remain closed to new investors forever, Schoenfeld says he doesn't know.\nBut mutual funds in the past have gone on to re-open, including Fidelity's Contrafund (FCNTX), one of the most popular funds at $93.7 billion in assets. It welcomed back new accounts in December 2008 after having previously been closed since April 2006.\nThe fund's manager, Will Danoff, said at the time that dollars from new investors could help him to scoop up stocks that had been knocked down by the financial crisis."

Such a level of growth now seems to be \"out of reach,\" the head of the Cour des Comptes also told French daily Le Monde in an interview published Tuesday.\nThe Cour des Comptes's report underscores the conundrum facing President Francois Hollande and his government: weak growth means they will either miss their targets or have to conduct more austerity to reach those targets, which may hurt growth further.\nSo far, the government has dodged the problem, saying it will wait to discuss growth forecasts with Brussels. Meanwhile, private economists now expect little-to-no growth this year and the International Monetary Fund has further cut its forecast to a 0.3% expansion from 0.4%.\nThe state's auditor estimates that if GDP growth is 0.3% next year, the deficit would be 0.25 points higher than forecast at 3.25%. Even with 0.8% growth, there is a risk the government is too optimistic about how much revenue it will get from taxes, it added.\nIn a letter responding to the Cour des Comptes's report, Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said the government is sticking to its 3% deficit target, but acknowledged there are numerous uncertainties surrounding the growth outlook and the 2013 forecast will be \"reevaluated\" during the preparation for the presentation of a stability program to French parliament in April.\nThe state auditor also criticized the government's balance between taxes and spending, noting that less than 25% of the effort to bring down the deficit next year is based on spending cuts and more than 75% on tax increases.\n\"The absolute priority from now on is to intensify the effort on spending in all public administrations,\" the Cour des Comptes said in its report.

        "webpage": "OECD offers guidance for multinationals in \"weak governance\" zones\n12/06/2006 - Multinational enterprises investing in countries characterised by weak or non-existent government need to take special care in handling a range of risks and ethical dilemmas not usually encountered in countries with stronger governance arrangements. A new Risk Awareness Tool for Multinational Enterprises in Weak Governance Zones from the OECD is designed to help them.\nAround 900 million people, or approximately 15 per cent of the world's population, live in so-called 'weak governance' zones, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where governments are unwilling or unable to assume their responsibilities in relation to public administration and protecting human rights. The OECD Risk Awareness Tool is designed to help companies to think about the risks and dilemmas they may face in such zones and how they can respond to them.\nThe Risk Awareness Tool was developed as part of work by the OECD Investment Committee, which groups all 30 OECD countries and a number of non-OECD participants. It also responds to a request by participants in the 2005 G8 Gleneagles Summit which called for \"OECD guidance for companies operating in zones of weak governance.\"\nOne of the OECD Investment Committee's principal instruments is the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, a government-backed code of conduct for international business widely used as a yardstick for responsible business conduct, including in developing countries. Consistent with the objectives and principles of the Guidelines, which are voluntary rather than binding, the Risk Awareness Tool is non-prescriptive but sets out a range of questions for companies to consider in such areas as: 1) obeying the law and observing international instruments; 2) heightened care in managing investments, 3) knowing business partners and clients; 4) dealing with public sector officials; and 5) speaking out about wrongdoing.\nThe countries responsible for drawing up the Risk Awareness Tool recognise that building governance and economic, political and civil institutions is the task of the political leadership and the citizens of the countries concerned: only they can formulate and implement necessary reforms. But multinational enterprises operating in such countries have influence, and the Risk Awareness Tool can help them avoid actions that may hinder efforts to build better governance while at the same time encouraging them to consider whether there is a positive role they can play.\nThe Risk Awareness Tool has benefited from inputs from business, trade unions and civil society representatives from both OECD and non-OECD countries and economies. It also draws on the work of other OECD bodies, notably in the areas of public governance, anti-corruption and development assistance for conflict prevention. In the next phase, business and stakeholders will work with the OECD to identify sources of practical experience in meeting the challenges that it addresses.\nFor further information, please contact Kathryn Gordon of the OECD's Investment Division, which serves as secretariat to the OECD Investment Committee (tel. + 33 1 4524 9842).

Making Risk-Adjusted Forecasting Work\nFew companies are doing it well. Here's how to get started, and why it's worth the effort.\nBy Nilly Essaides May 22, 2014 \u2022 Reprints\n\"Risk-adjusted forecasting\" is a new buzzword in financial planning and analysis (FP&A). What, exactly, does it mean? \"Risk-adjusted forecasting and planning involves shocking the financial forecasts with major risk drivers in an integrated and flexible manner,\" says H-K Bryn, strategic risk partner at Deloitte in the U.K. \"The approach allows a more robust and transparent evaluation of volatility and risk within current plans, helping to build a better understanding of the potential upside - and downside - inherent in the future of the business.\"\nMark Pellerin, a principal at Oliver Wyman, which conducts an annual risk survey with the Association for Financial Professionals (AFP), puts it another way: \"When I think of risk, I think about having a clear understanding and definition of the relationships between the variation in expected outcome and risk factors,\" he says. \"Risk-adjusted forecasting is coming up with alternative forecasts that have clearly defined relationships with the variables and risks.\" It's not about having a crystal ball, but about achieving a better and more precise definition of the drivers of, and risks to, the organization's financial performance.\n\"You cannot get away from uncertainty in the world,\" Pellerin says. \"No matter how precise the prediction, there's an extreme level of unpredictability\" in the corporate planning process, adds Steve Player, managing partner of the Player Group and program director for the North American arm of the Beyond Budgeting Roundtable (BBRT).\nAlthough it can't provide certainty in its predictions for the future, a risk-adjusted forecast can be well worth the effort. \"If you've done a risk-adjusted forecast, you can begin having the management intervention discussion - i.e., how do you react if one or more of those risks or opportunities crystallize?\" Bryn says. The idea is to get to a more transparent evaluation and business forecasting process at every level to create value-based decisions.\nCompanies that do this well can respond more quickly to changes in the competitive environment and shifts in the marketplace. Charles Alsdorf, a director with Deloitte, expects that in the near future \"one way companies will differentiate themselves is by getting better at understanding risk and bringing that into financial planning.\"\nThe best approach for introducing risk-adjusted forecasting into an organization is to start small and build up. For many companies, that means implementing a risk-adjusted approach to a one-off project - such as a divestiture or a large CapEx project - or else rolling out risk-adjusted forecasting to just one business unit. Then, as their first foray is successful, companies can grow their risk-adjusted forecasting capability over time. \"This really helps in terms of getting buy-in from management,\" Pellerin says. \"It shows real benefits along the way, as opposed to trying to make a large investment in overhauling the entire process. This is not a one-time effort. You start with a pilot, select two or three key risks to your organization, and incorporate them into the FP&A process.\"\nTo select the right risks, Alsdorf recommends that companies look to their enterprise risk management (ERM) program. After all, risk-adjusted forecasting sits at the intersection of ERM and FP&A. \"Do up-front analytics to identify the variables that would drive changing the business forecast,\" he says. He suggests choosing the top 5 to 10 risks identified by the company's ERM initiative. Bryn agrees; he says that after the first 10 to 15 risks, adding more risks to the forecasting process offers diminishing benefits.\nOnce an organization has pinpointed the factors that might cause disruptions to its forecast, it's ready to bring those key variables into the planning process. According to Bryn, the next step is for the company to describe each risk from the perspective of both probability and impact, then put the risks into a simulation model to more precisely project their impacts on cash flow and earnings.

Justice Department officials were expected to discuss it at a news conference later Monday.The settlement stems from the sale of securities made up of subprime mortgages, which led to both the housing boom and bust that triggered the Great Recession at the end of 2007.\nCitigroup and other banks downplayed the risks of subprime mortgages when packaging and selling them to mutual funds, investment trusts, pensions, as well as other banks and investors. The securities, which contained so-called residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, plunged in value when the housing market collapsed in 2006 and 2007. Those losses triggered a financial crisis that pushed the economy into the worst recession since the 1930s.The bank separately agreed in April to pay $1.13 billion to settle claims by investors seeking that the lender buy back billions of dollars in residential mortgage-backed securities.\nIn the deal announced Monday, Citigroup will make a $4 billion civil monetary payment to the Justice Department, and another $500 million in compensatory payments to state attorneys general and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.The bank will provide $2.5 billion in consumer relief, which will include financing for construction and preservation of affordable housing, as well as principal reduction and forbearance for residential loans.California will reimburse the state pension funds, CalPERS and CalSTRS, with $102,700,000 in damages it receives from Citigroup. The funds lost money on investments in mortgage-backed securities.\nCalifornia is also guaranteed $90 million in consumer relief. \"Citigroup misled consumers and profited by providing California's pension funds with incomplete information about mortgage investments,\" Attorney General Kamala D. Harris said in a press release. \"This settlement holds Citi accountable and compensates the state's pension funds that protect the retirement savings of hardworking Californians.\"Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said the settlement ends all pending civil investigations related to its handling of mortgage-backed securities.\nThe two sides had earlier been far apart in their negotiations. The Justice Department had warned last month that it would sue after the bank offered to pay under $4 billion to resolve the matter, a sum substantially less than what the government was seeking.The bank will take a pre-tax charge of about $3.8 billion because of the settlement during its second quarter.Shares of Citigroup Inc. rose nearly 4 percent to $48.82 an hour before the U.S. stock market opened Monday.The Citigroup settlement comes months after a similar  -  but much larger  -  deal between the Justice Department and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the nation's biggest bank. After months of negotiations, the bank last year agreed to pay $13 billion after an investigation into toxic mortgage-backed securities.\nAs part of the deal, which included settlements with New York, California and other states, JPMorgan agreed to provide $4 billion in relief to homeowners affected by the bad loans. The bank also acknowledged that it misrepresented the quality of its securities to investors.That deal was seen as a possible template for settlement with Citigroup and Bank of America Corp., which was accused in a government lawsuit last summer of failing to disclose risks and misleading investors in its sale of $850 million of mortgage-linked securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related lawsuit against Bank of America.\nThe settlement is part of an ongoing Justice Department effort to target financial misconduct, even as critics have said the government has not been aggressive enough. In the last two months, Swiss bank Credit Suisse has reached a $2.6 billion guilty plea for helping wealthy Americans evade taxes, and French bank BNP Paribas struck an $8.9 billion deal related to its handling of transactions for clients in Sudan, Iran and Cuba."

        "webpage": "States, like most economic entities, will struggle with a classic management dilemma when their expenses exceed revenues.\n\nWhen this happens, they'll oftentimes focus almost entirely on cutting costs.\n\nHowever, turnaround managers learn that it's tough, if not impossible, to save yourself into a sustainable profit. This is because when revenue flatlines or declines, the inexorable growth in expenses quickly become overwhelming.\n\nIf the focus is on costs, the situation will continue to deteriorate and recovery will become increasingly difficult. The belief sets in that survival is only possible if dramatic action is taken  -  divisions shutdown, sizable layoffs and so on.\n\nThe reality is that cutting costs is an important step in the turnaround process, but it isn't a path to recovery. Only an increase in economic activity is an indication of recovery, and only increasing revenue can put an organization on a sustainable growth path.\n\nSustained increases in revenue allow for investment in the future instead of just keeping up with increases in operating costs.\n\nAs a practical matter, governmental organizations are labor-intensive and the majority of the budget goes to wages and benefits, leaving few options when it comes to reducing costs. There's waste and inefficiency like you'd find in any large organization, but even if all of it could be eliminated, the savings wouldn't do more than temporarily improve the state's budget outlook.\n\nI should point out that I'm referring to typical general and administrative operating expenses. I'll leave the growth in pension fund obligations to another column.\n\nDon't get me wrong, every organization should constantly be looking for ways to reduce operating costs, improve productivity and increase efficiency.\n\nThe point is that the best path to improving Connecticut's economy is one that is more focused on growth and less focused on trying to \"save ourselves into a profit.\" We'd be in better shape already if more of the past few years' talk about cost-cutting had instead been about what we can do to create the conditions that will attract increased investment.\n\nHere's the thing: We can change this narrative. To the degree that we've been talking about growth in more than platitudes, that narrative has largely been in the hands of one governmental entity or another. Left in the hands of these well-intentioned folks, the tendency is to create some kind of advertising program, give it a catchy name and market it as a big thing that's going to somehow change the view of Connecticut held by those who are looking to place investment capital. One of the advertising principles I've learned is that advertising can't turn a bad product into a good one. We have to give people a product they want to buy or, in this case, one in which they want to invest.\n\nWe have a lot of terrific people in economic development in our state. The problem is that we need to hear more from people who have direct experience running businesses and investing capital. The people we need to hear from are those who are dealing directly with state regulations and meeting payroll every week. The input of CEOs is great, but we need their operating folks at the table, too.\n\nConnecticut is blessed with many talented and experienced people working in high-value industries, including financial services, insurance, aerospace, shipbuilding, high-tech and clean manufacturing, bioscience and health care. These industries are also represented by industry associations, which are led by some of the best executives in their respective industries. We need to get these people engaged in this discussion, too.\n\nR. Michael Goman is a principal of Goman + York Property Advisors LLC, an East Hartford-based real estate advisor."

        "webpage": "4 Things to Watch in Bank of America Corp's Earnings Report\nMatthew Frankel |\nBank of America (NYSE: BAC ) reports its second quarter earnings Wednesday, July 16, and this will be one of the most closely watched reports in the financial sector. The consensus is calling for earnings of $0.29, down from $0.32 during the same quarter a year ago, but a welcome improvement from the five-cent loss the company reported in the first quarter.\nHowever, more important than the earnings number is how Bank of America is doing as a business and how its long-term strategies are playing out. Here are four things to pay particular attention to when the bank issues its earnings report.\nImprovement in asset quality In order for Bank of America to be healthy and to truly put the financial crisis behind it, the quality of the bank's assets needs to keep improving.\nWhen Bank of America last reported, net charge-offs fell by about $200 million from the previous quarter, and by more than $1 billion from a year earlier. The amount of past-due loans as well as credit allowances also dropped.\nHowever, to have $5.6 billion in past-due loans is still too high. As is well over $1 billion in charge-offs each quarter. Also, the company's provision for credit losses jumped from $300 million to $1 billion in the first quarter, so keep an eye on that number this time around.\nEfficiency needs to improve As my fellow contributor Patrick Morris pointed out, Bank of America was the least efficient bank among its peers for 2013.\nSource: Wells Fargo Investor Relations\nThe company is well aware of this, and has been taking steps to improve the efficiency of its operations. For instance, the company has been closing branches and has been investing a lot of its resources into growing its mobile banking network, which so far has been successful.\nSource: company's Q1 investor presentation\nOver the past two years alone, Bank of America has added more than 5 million mobile banking users and has closed more than 500 of its branches, bringing the total down from 5,651 to 5,095. The company has said the number of branches could fall below 5,000 in 2014, so this is a number to watch, as well as its impact on the bank's efficiency ratio.\nThe retail brokerage could become a real contender Recently, I published an article about the bank's Merrill Edge discount brokerage and how it could potentially attract customers from other sector leaders like TD Ameritrade and E*Trade.\nMerrill Edge offers the lowest commissions of any of its peers, and the bank has recently made their brokerage an even more appealing place to keep your assets. The bank has three tiers of perks that are offered to customers with total assets of $20,000 or more, including free brokerage trades, better rewards on credit cards, lower interest rates on loans, and more.\nSo far it looks like Merrill Edge is catching on nicely, with assets up by more than 35% in the past two years. Any growth in the brokerage business is a very good sign for the long-term, as brokerage customers are some of the best ones to have. For example, Wells Fargo's brokerage customers have four more products with the bank, on average, than customers without a brokerage account.\nCredit cards and cross-selling Speaking of cross-selling products, Bank of America has stepped up its efforts to sell its BankAmericard credit card products, particularly to its existing banking customers.\nThe bank issued more than a million new credit cards during the first quarter, a 13% year-over-year increase. However, the percentage of these cards issued to existing customers actually dropped by 1% to 63%.\nSo, it would definitely be nice to see another million credit cards issued, it's far more important to the bank and its efficiency that the percentage of cards issued to existing customers increases. Studies have shown it costs much less to sell a product to a current customer than it does to go recruit a new one.\nBank of America has come a long way since the crisis ended, but there is still work to be done to turn the company into a stable and efficient company that can generate consistent, growing profits for years to come. And, this earnings report should give us some valuable insight into the progress toward that ultimate goal.\nBank of America + Apple? This device makes it possible.Apple recently recruited a secret-development \"dream team\" to guarantee its newest smart device was kept hidden from the public for as long as possible. But the secret is out, and some early viewers are claiming its destined to change everything from banking to health care. In fact, ABI Research predicts 485 million of this type of device will be sold per year. But one small company makes Apple's gadget possible. And its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors. To be one of them, and see Apple's newest smart gizmo, just click here!

The fact that everybody picks up on when reporting on the 2011 budget is that debt issuance is going to exceed tax revenues for the second year running  -  or, to put it another way, that more than half the budget is being paid for by borrowing rather than taxes. For me, however, the scarier fact is that more than half of government tax revenue is going to go straight back out the door in debt-service payments.\nIf you're at all interested in Japan's budget, the Yomiuri Shimbun editorial on the subject is excellent; for a shorter version, James Simms has a good overview in the WSJ. The problem is a familiar one: politicians are happy spending money and incapable of implementing budget cuts, and the result is a slow-moving fiscal trainwreck.\nThe situation in Japan is particularly depressing because the country has no major ethnic or political rifts. Sure, there's political jostling, both within and between the parties. But it's nothing compared to the vitriol and mistrust that we see in the US, and somehow I can't imagine Greece-style riots in Japan either. But still the technocrats can't make any headway.\nThe lesson here, I think, is that it's very, very hard for a government to enact a serious fiscal adjustment unless and until the bond market forces its hand. The Brits are trying, of course  -  and we'll see whether or not the coalition government can succeed. But as we saw with George W Bush, the fiscal rectitude of one administration can be more than wiped out during the course of the next.\nEven now, with the attention of the world more concentrated on sovereign fiscal issues than ever, the Japanese government can still contrive to raise agricultural subsidies by 40% and send child-care payments soaring, including payments to families who don't need the money. It's even getting rid of highway tolls. Oh, and it's cutting the corporate tax rate.\nFrom a bond-market perspective, this basically just means an ever-greater supply of JGBs: we're still a very long way from any real credit risk, given the political power of the owners of those bonds. But as a lesson in fiscal political economy, Japan is much more worrisome. Everybody agrees that the budget must be cut and the country put onto a sustainable fiscal course. But no one is capable of doing that, and instead they go in the opposite direction entirely. It's the see-no-evil easy choice to make. And I suspect that we'll see continue to see similar choices being made in other highly-indebted countries around the world. Including the US.\nThe longevity trend bond arrives Next Post \"\nCounterparties 13 comments\nFelix Salmon no longer works for Reuters.

Over these years, the average household income of Whites remained double that of either Black or Latino families.\nBut when wealth was considered, the amount of available assets remaining after all indebtedness was deducted, White families' wealth grew six times that of either that for either Black or Latino families.\n\"When it comes to economic gaps between whites and communities of color in the United States, income inequality tells part of the story. But let's not forget about wealth. Wealth isn't just money in the bank; its insurance against tough times, tuition to get a better education and a better job, savings to retire on and a springboard into the middle class. In short, wealth translates into opportunity.\"\nThe report also found that although the Great Recession of (2007-2009) hit communities of color particularly hard, the type of financial losses varied. With Black unemployment double that of the rest of the nation, Black retirement assets fell by 35 percent during these years. This data suggests that lower-income Black families withdrew money from retirement savings following a job loss or other adverse events. For Latinos, the average retirement asset decline was 18 percent.\nBy contrast, the Great Recession years took half of Latino family home equity, compared to an average 25 percent for Black and White families. To better understand this lost wealth, it is relevant to note that in 2010 only half of Black and Latino families owned their homes, while 75 percent of Whites were homeowners.\nWith more assets and diversified income streams, white wealth declined 11 percent during the Great Recession. But Black wealth dropped 31 percent during these same years and Latino families dropped the greatest at 44 percent.\nYet despite these findings, it is equally true that many families of color still desire to own a home and their own piece of America. Their dreams may be deferred, but still remains strong. As the nation's economy continues to struggle towards prosperity, tightened mortgage lending, higher FHA fees, and continued discussions of federally-mandated down payments do not bode well for more families of color reaching the American Dream.\nFor the Urban Institute, the answer to these growing and disturbing disparities is reconsidering public policies.\n\"Families of color were disproportionately affected by the recession. However, the fact that they were not on good wealth-building paths before this financial crisis calls into question whether a whole range of polices (from tax to safety net) have actually been helping minorities get ahead in the modern economy,\" according to the study.\nContrasting programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (SNAP) as two social safety programs designed to provide basic essentials; the report noted how tax subsidies for homeownership and retirement policies actually help to build wealth.\n\"The federal government spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year to support long-term asset development. But these asset-building subsidies primarily benefit high-income families, while low-income families receive next to nothing.\"\nThe Urban Institute's conclusions are strikingly similar to those reached earlier this year by the Brandeis University's Institute on Assets and Policies.\n\"The evidence points to policy and the configuration of both opportunities and barriers in workplaces, schools and communities that reinforce deeply entrenched racial dynamics in how wealth is accumulated and that continue to permeate the most important spheres of everyday life,\" the Brandeis report stated.\nHere's hoping that those entrusted with policy decisions are listening.\nCharlene Crowell is a communications manager with the Center for Responsible Lending.

        "webpage": "America's Debt\nCEOs: Taxes have to be part of debt plan By Jeanne Sahadi @CNNMoney As Congress dithers on resolving the fiscal cliff and long-term debt, 87 CEOs of major companies publicly urged lawmakers to compromise -- and fast. Their prescription: a debt-reduction plan that raises tax revenue and cuts spending. They believe any plan should be bipartisan and implemented gradually so it does not threaten the economic recovery. It also has to protect the vulnerable. The CEOs have lent their backing to a set of principles put forth by the Campaign to Fix the Debt, a nonpartisan group founded by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, who chaired President Obama's debt reduction commission. Related: Why debt is a threat to national security The executives include some of the most prominent names from Wall Street, Silicon Valley and many bedrock U.S. companies. Among them, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Steve Ballmer of Microsoft, Jeff Immelt of General Electric, and Samuel Allen of Deere & Company. (Here's the full list.) In general, they back the plan proposed by Bowles and Simpson as a framework to start negotiations. That plan would reduce debt by $4 trillion over a decade by cutting defense and discretionary spending, curbing federal entitlement costs and reforming the tax code. The CEOs are pushing for tax reform that lowers tax rates and reduces the value of tax breaks. That is similar to the tax reform proposed by Mitt Romney. But it differs in a key way: it would raise revenue to reduce the deficit whereas Romney's plan would be \"revenue neutral\" and deficit reduction would come solely from spending cuts. Fact check: Obama, Romney on the deficit When asked for comment on the CEOs' public stance, Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said, \"As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney proved that you can put together bipartisan majorities to balance the budget without raising taxes.\" President Obama has proposed changes to Medicare, would raise tax revenue from high-income families, and his 2013 budget proposal would temporarily stop the debt from growing faster than the economy. But he has yet to put forward a comprehensive debt-reduction plan. \"There's a strong and growing consensus that the only way to reduce the deficit while also growing the economy is through a balanced approach that includes both tough spending cuts and increased revenue. The president has laid out such a plan,\" Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said. The 87 CEOs, some of whom rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning, hope lawmakers will make the most of their time before 2012 comes to a close. \"We are one deal away from fixing the debt and putting our nation back on a stronger economic footing that can restore us to greater job growth,\" Mark T. Bertolini, chairman, CEO and president of Aetna, said in a statement. \"If the Congress can commit to a plan outline as early as possible after the election, it will restore business confidence in our economy and investment will follow.\" Congress won't return to work until after the Nov. 6 election and will be taking a week off for Thanksgiving. Effectively, that means lawmakers have left themselves less than 5 working weeks to figure out what to do about the $7 trillion worth of tax increases and spending cuts that start taking effect in January.

        "webpage": "Agency Compensation Playbook: Who's Worth What?\nBy Andrea Wells | February 25, 2013 Email This\n2013 Agency Salary Survey\nManaging sales in an independent agency is a team sport. From top level managers to office and support staff - every person in an agency has a role to play in helping the agency win the sales game.\nWhen one person fails to make the play, the whole agency team suffers. And when an agency suffers, so does employee compensation. Or at least it should, say the experts.\nProducer compensation in particular suffers when sales are down, but the compensation of everyone in an agency should be affected when sales don't happen, says Al Diamond, president of the Cherry Hill, N.J.-based Agency Consulting Group, an independent agency valuation and consulting firm serving firms nationwide.\n\"Employees need to realize that if an agency is going backward, for whatever reason - lost business, soft rates, no growth - it's very difficult to give more money [to salaries] because you are literally taking it out of whatever profit is left, if there is any,\" Diamond says. Agency compensation should be sensitive to the growth and profitability of the agency.\nDiamond says he witnesses the vast majority of agencies - 95 percent by his estimate - continuing to give salary increases based solely on the longevity of the employee, with average raises ranging from 2 percent to 3 percent. Traditional compensation models that reward employees based on years of service is a horrible way of rewarding good employees, he says, because \"agencies end up rewarding mediocre employees, right along with the good ones.\" Agency compensation should be sensitive to the growth and profitability of the agency. That's why Diamond advocates incentive-based compensation for all employees, not just producers. \"We are spending a lot of time doing incentive compensation programs for agencies to get them out of the process of giving raises based on longevity,\" he says.\nJustin Berry, vice president, sales management for MarshBerry, a national consulting services organization for independent agencies and brokerages, hears a lot of talk about incentive-based compensation for employees outside of sales. But, he agrees, it's mostly just talk. \"I wouldn't say it's the norm,\" Berry says. \"It's the norm for a conversation but not all agency owners have gone to incentive-based compensation yet.\"\nAgency compensation models have to move in that direction, according to Berry. \"It has to go to where they [owners] can have control over certain metrics. It's not the entire salary or base, but we'd like to see a standardized renewal expectation of at least 90 percent for someone in the account executive role. If they are not meeting that level then there will be negative consequences that apply. If they are above that threshold they stay static on their salary. If they exceed the standards of using that 90 percent they are getting some type of bonus,\" Berry says. The bonus could be a cash reward or other incentive such as increased vacation time. Brian Burke, chairman of B.H. Burke & Co. Inc., a Westbrook, Conn.-based organization that advises individuals and firms on the sale, purchase and management of independent insurance agencies, says many of the agencies he works with understand the need to improve the compensation system. He says the recession and the challenging insurance market of recent years convinced a number of agency owners to finally change their agency compensation playbook, especially as it deals with sales.\n\"Most agencies know that there's some improvement to be made on the sales compensation line,\" Burke says. \"So this period of a few years spurred a number of them to finally do what they know they should be doing there.\" One of the biggest changes he's seen to producer compensation has been the elimination of renewal commissions on small accounts. This compensation play is nothing new, Burke adds. But tough times brought more buy-in from latecomers in the industry.\n\"Almost all agencies are realizing that you really can't afford to pay the service staff and the producer on small accounts,\" he says. The transition has been slow - it's been happe"

Also, the United States and European Union are working hard on a new and dynamic Transatlantic Partnership.\nThese three important initiatives will contribute to U.S. economic growth and job creation, but we can do more to compete in growing markets around the world. The United States needs an active trade and investment game plan to open more markets and keep them open.\nThe facts today confirm that world trade \ufffd exports and imports \ufffd is more essential than ever to U.S. economic growth and job creation, having risen from 20.4 percent of our nation\ufffds gross domestic product in 1990 to 31.5 percent in 2011. The United States is now the second-largest exporter of merchandise in the world and the largest exporter of commercial services.\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, imports and exports added more than 1 percentage point to U.S. economic growth annually during the 2008-2009 recession, even as consumer spending and investment fell sharply. International trade also supports American jobs across the economy. In 1992, before the United States had entered into NAFTA, the GATT Uruguay Round agreements and a series of other trade and investment agreements, the total of trade-related jobs in the United States was only 14.5 million \ufffd 1 in 10. By 2008, trade-related jobs dependent on exports and imports had grown to 38.4 million \ufffd more than 1 in 5.\nIn 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt recognized National Foreign Trade Week, the predecessor of World Trade Week. He and all successive presidents have followed proclamations with action, pursuing negotiation of trade agreements to open world markets to U.S. goods and services.\nToday, about 40 percent of U.S. exports go to our free-trade agreement partners, and exports to FTA partner countries are growing faster than exports to countries lacking agreements with the United States. Last year, the United States sold about $50 billion more in manufactured goods to our FTA partner countries than we bought from them. In addition, the recent FTAs with South Korea, Colombia and Panama are expected to increase U.S. exports by more than $10 billion.\nWith more than 95 percent of the world\ufffds population \ufffd representing 80 percent of the world\ufffds purchasing power \ufffd now outside the United States and growing competition from other countries for those customers, our nation\ufffds growth and job creation increasingly depend on expanding U.S. trade and investment opportunities.\nAchieving these goals requires the United States to push ahead with an active trade policy to help U.S. companies and workers increase their competitiveness and ensure that both domestic and foreign markets remain open for investment. Such initiatives should include:\n\u2022 Passing legislation to establish permanent normal trade relations with Russia before the August Congressional recess.\n\u2022 Seeking, this year, to complete a comprehensive and high-standard Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and to launch Transatlantic Partnership negotiations.\n\u2022 Revitalizing multilateral and plurilateral talks at the World Trade Organization.\n\u2022 Providing the president with new trade negotiating authority.\n\u2022 Vigorously enforcing U.S. rights under international agreements, and constructively engaging China and other emerging growth countries to eliminate market access barriers.\nTo succeed, a robust trade policy requires domestic policies that will build a highly skilled workforce, strengthen America\ufffds leadership in research and development, enforce and protect U.S. intellectual property rights around the world and institute globally competitive corporate tax policies.\nOther countries are actively pursuing trade and investment initiatives to open up international markets for their companies and workers to sell more of their products and services. We need to step up our efforts on our own existing initiatives and commit ourselves to pursuing new market-opening initiatives to help further support U.S. economic growth and jobs. Simply put, we need more of a sense of urgency on trade in the United States. John Engler is a former three-term governor of Michigan and president of Business Roundtable."

Demand for Swaps Collateral Could Bolster Bonds\nNew collateral rules could slow rise in Treasury yields.\nBy Matthew Leising and Liz Capo McCormick, Bloomberg June 11, 2013\nNew collateral rules for hedge funds, insurers and others in the $633 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market are poised to boost demand for U.S. Treasuries, potentially slowing rising yields as the Federal Reserve considers scaling back unprecedented stimulus.\nSwaps traders will need to come up with $800 billion to $4.6 trillion to meet Dodd-Frank Act regulations requiring that derivatives be backed by clearinghouses that collect upfront collateral such as cash or Treasuries, according to estimates from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee. The regulations take effect today for the second group of firms designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the market for interest-rate and credit-default swaps.\n\"This is going to be a new, very powerful engine that drives demand for Treasuries, so you have to expect it will impact yields,\" said Ted Leveroni, executive director of derivatives strategy at New York-based trade-processer Omgeo LLC. \"There are a lot of firms out there -- I know because they've told me -- that are concerned about having the available collateral.\"\nThe rush for collateral may be an unintended benefit from swaps rules designed to protect against a cascade of bank failures.\nMounting speculation that an improving economy will prompt Fed policy makers to taper $85 billion of monthly purchases of Treasuries and government-backed mortgage bonds triggered the biggest jump in 10-year Treasury yields since December 2010 last month. The yield reached 2.23 percent on May 29, the highest intraday level since April 2012.\nThe rise in the benchmark interest-rate helped fuel the biggest loss in U.S. investment-grade company bonds since the 2008 financial crisis, with the debt declining 2.28 percent in May on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Index.\nClearinghouses seek to limit the effects of a user default by obtaining up-front margin and requiring additional collateral based on daily swings in market values.\nBacking trades with collateral will transform a group of tightly interconnected banks and money managers into a more structured marketplace, CFTC chairman Gary Gensler said in an interview in New York last week.\n'Better System'\n\"It's quite possible that there's a tremendous amount of efficiencies when large financial institutions bring their swaps into one or two or three clearinghouses, rather than have these bilateral relationships,\" he said. While \"it has a cost,\" he said, \"it's a far better system.\"\nPrivately negotiated swaps complicated regulators' efforts to resolve the 2008 financial crisis, which pushed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., one of the biggest dealers, into bankruptcy and prompted a government rescue of American International Group Inc., which had amassed bets on the U.S. housing market using credit derivatives.\nThe world's largest swaps dealers including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc, as well as active traders in the market, have been required by the CFTC to clear most of their trades since March 11. A third group of firms including pension plans will be phased into the clearing mandate in September. Only trades done after the effective dates must be cleared.\n\"The demand-supply mismatch for high-quality debt is going to be an ongoing structural trend going forward that will help anchor short-term Treasuries,\" Jerome Schneider, head of the short-term strategies and money-markets desk at Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment Management Co., said in a June 4 telephone interview. \"Even if the Fed were to come in and adjust their monetary policy tomorrow, the short end of the Treasury yield curve will remain pinned.\"\nDemand for high-quality collateral to meet clearing mandates could reach $1.8 trillion to $4.6 trillion in \"stressed\" markets, according to industry estimates compiled by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, consisting of bond dealers and investors who meet quarterly with the Treasury Department.\nTreasuries, government-backed mortgage bonds and some guaranteed asset-backed securities are among the types of debt instruments the committee said were deemed as \"high quality.\"\nGlobal Regulation\nTotal demand stemming from additional collateral that will be needed to meet all new market regulations and global capital and liquidity rules for banks may reach $11.2 trillion, according to estimates by the co"

The transition into the fifth generation of the country's leadership calls for needed changes.\n\"The China of my career is not the China of the future,\" said Ray Jovanovich '84, a retired CIO of Amundi Asia who has lived in Asia for the past quarter century. \"But analysts should welcome, not fear, a slowing Chinese economy.\"\nJovanovich addressed the issues China's economy will face in its leadership transition.\n\"The rise of labor and the rise of consumption is the future of China,\" Jovanovich said. \"China's economy can no longer sustain this one-dimensional nature of investment into manufacturing for exports. Effectively, this rebalancing is vital to the next 30-year stage for China's economic development. They have reached the limits of the export model. The country has to evolve and embrace change.\"\nIn the past 30 years, China thrived on its open-door policy, which Deng Xiaoping established in 1978. China's economy has been in its 'golden age' since then, but reliance on excessive credit and low consumption rates have caused instability. China's new generation of leadership now faces the challenge to develop a healthier, more stable market.\n\"Consumption is being dwarfed by the massive amount of investment that is being sponsored by the state, and this is unsustainable,\" Jovanovich said. \"This is why the change has to occur. You can't continue to have this excess credit phenomenon which we have seen in China over the course of the past several years. So comprehensive social security reform and the stimulation of consumption are also the future of China, but it is a monumental challenge; it will take decades to evolve, but they will do it on their terms.\"\nThe fifth generation of leadership will have difficulty making changes to the economy because it has less control over the nation than previous generations.\n\"The China of the next 30 years that I see is absolutely incumbent for another change in the direction of the country, and change is always difficult,\" Jovanovich said. \"It's always difficult without strong leadership. The transition to the fifth generation, which will take place this year, brings new challenges for change. This fifth generation of leadership has, perhaps, less control than any previous generation. In fact, the ability to run China has become more complex and more complicated. So, the ability to assert authority is a major challenge for the fifth generation, and that is why this issue of implementing change in terms of rebalancing China is absolutely vital.\"\nChina's one-child policy has caused a \"demographic nightmare.\" The country is aging rapidly and is not wealthy enough to survive on low consumption and high savings rates.\n\"The reality is that there is no other future for China because of the evolving demographic nightmare,\" Jovanovich said. \"Within Asia, the demography runs the entire spectrum. Japan of course is a nation that is aging rapidly and is very old. But Japan is a wealthy nation with high savings rates and low consumption. China's demography, in many respects, is similar to Japan, but it is not as wealthy as Japan.\n\"The one-child policy has become somewhat of a restraint because now it is a demographic nightmare with the country aging so rapidly. And this I believe is what is driving the change and the willingness to embrace change because there is no other way forward given the way that demographic change occurred.\"\nJovanovich also discussed how international student programs encouraged by Deng contributed to the Chinese economy's long term stability during its golden age.\n\"The golden age was made possible by this embrace of change which Deng recognized,\" Jovanovich said. \"Deng embarked on a policy which was effectively similar to his own experience, and that is to allow the best and the brightest of the nation to go abroad, to be educated by the best universities that the west has to offer because he felt that this was another prerequisite for China's future 50 years later. He also recognized that most of these students would not return to China over the first several waves that sought education beyond China because there was not an economic opportunity to return to China, but that over time there would be - that China would grow and develop. From his point of view - and this is what makes him a great statesman - is that he recognized that this was the way to accelerate the development of China, to ensure China's rise.\"\nThat message resonated to senior economics major Su Haoyuan. Su intends to return to China after either attending grad school or working a few years in the United States.\n\"I learned a great deal of information about the whole economy in China and a little bit about the investment strategies in China,\" Su said. \"I think Ray's point of view is different from the majority of the investors and business magazines and newspapers. It is really fascinating because that is his personal experience.\" More News"

If not, then it won't just be the victims who pay the price. The rest of us will have to ante up as the elderly, who should have been able to pay their own way, are forced early into an enormously expensive publicly funded Medicaid system because some crook cheated them out of their life savings.There have been a number of deplorable examples of financial abuse of the elderly in the past few months in Erie and Niagara counties. The latest local case to hit the news involved Matt Pollack, 90, who had saved more than $600,000 over his lifetime so he could live out his final years at his home in Barker, Niagara County. But he was forced into assisted living because Kenneth Heitzenrater, someone he trusted as a son, swindled him out of his life savings. Heitzenrater, who deserved to go to jail for his crime, was sentenced to probation in an effort to force him to work to pay restitution.Lifespan of Greater Rochester Inc., in partnership with Weill Cornell Medical Center and the New York City Department for the Aging, released a report, \"Under the Radar: New York State Elder Prevalence Abuse Study,\" which found that for every reported case of financial abuse, 44 cases go unreported.New York State is one of only three states that does not have mandatory reporting of elder abuse/financial exploitation in the community. That needs to change.About three years ago, New York State did toughen its power of attorney law so that someone has to specifically indicate that another person has been granted the power to gift to themselves or others. However, many older power-of-attorney documents without this provision remain in force, a potential threat to a senior's well-being.Last year, State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman launched \"Smart Seniors,\" a statewide elder abuse prevention program designed to help seniors identify potential scams and abuses and provide them with information they can use to stay safe and healthy. The initiative is intended to protect those who are often targeted for financial exploitation, identity theft, telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud, home improvement ripoffs, Internet and online scams and physical abuse.That effort is supported by the New York State Coalition on Elder Abuse, which has also formulated a list of suggested legislative changes.A key suggestion involves strengthening New York's larceny statute, which does not address theft from a mentally impaired person. This often makes it very difficult to prosecute the growing number of cases involving financial exploitation of vulnerable older adults.Lifespan hopes to conduct a study similar to the Utah Exploitation Study, which calculated that Medicaid had been forced to pay several million dollars for the care of elderly victims of financial abuse.On a federal level, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., introduced the Robert Matava Exploitation Protection for Elder Adults Act last fall. The legislation would do a number of things, including amend telemarketing fraud statutes to add Ponzi schemes, health care and Medicare/Medicaid fraud as offenses.Sadly, elderly victims of financial abuse are often prematurely forced onto Medicaid and into nursing homes they were trying to avoid in the first place. There must be better protection for our senior citizens."

But the programs are often flawed and lack coordination. This initiative aims to reform trade-preference programs to expand market access for developing countries, especially the poorest.\n\nPersistent delays in concluding multilateral trade negotiations through the World Trade Organization (WTO), combined with the global economic crisis, increase the risk that the poorest developing countries will be further marginalized in the global economy. This is already happening to some degree as a result of the impact of the economic crisis on trade flows, and could be exacerbated if delays in concluding the Doha Round encourage the spread of regional and bilateral trade agreements. Unilateral trade preference programs are an important mechanism for mitigating these effects.\n\nHigh-income countries have already committed, via the Millennium Development Goals and again at the 2005 WTO ministerial in Hong Kong, to provide duty-free, quota-free market access for the least developed countries. Those commitments could provide a foundation for effective preference programs. But existing programs are often overly restrictive and complex, and lacking in coordination within and across countries."

One is the False Claims Act, which is often used to target fraud against the government, and the other is the 1989 FIRREA law.\nFIRREA, or the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, allows the government to seek civil penalties against anyone who commits a fraud \"affecting a federally insured financial institution.\"\nFIRREA does not yet have much of a track record in court, but the government turned to it in the wake of the financial crisis as a potential means to target civil fraud involving financial institutions.\nU.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff issued a two-page ruling that dismissed the claims in the lawsuit seeking penalties under the False Claims Act, but allowed the claims that seek penalties under FIRREA to advance. Rakoff, in New York, said he will explain the reasons for his decision at a later date.\nThe ruling comes as something of a surprise, since Rakoff at a hearing last month appeared skeptical of how the Justice Department had used FIRREA in its case.\nThe lawsuit, which targets Bank of America for more than $1 billion in losses incurred by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, accuses the bank of engaging in a scheme to defraud them through a program started at the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which the bank acquired in 2008.\nMuch of the legal dispute over the interpretation of the FIRREA law is about exactly how to understand the phrase \"affecting a federally insured financial institution\"\nThe Justice Department has used that phrase to cover the financial institutions that also allegedly committed the fraud in a trio of cases against Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon Corp and Wells Fargo & Co.\nAll three have argued that such a reading turns the law on its head.\nBut another federal judge in New York rejected that reasoning last month in the case against Bank of New York Mellon, and allowed accusations that the bank overcharged clients for trading currencies to move forward.\nIn its lawsuit against Bank of America, the government said the alleged fraud also affected several federally insured community banks, which held concentrated investments in preferred stock in Fannie and Freddie.\nThe value of that stock plummeted in value when the two firms became insolvent and were placed into conservatorship in 2008.\nBank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson said the bank was pleased that the case was reduced. Rakoff's ruling eliminated claims under the False Claims Act, a Civil War-era law that allows the government to receive up to triple its damages.\n\"We continue to believe that neither Bank of America nor Countrywide defrauded Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and we will address the remaining allegations as this matter proceeds,\" Grayson said.\nEllen Davis, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the case, declined comment on the ruling.\nThe ruling also allows the government's case against former chief operating officer for a Countrywide lending division, Rebecca Mairone to move forward.\n\"We are still reviewing the court's ruling, and we still maintain that Rebecca has always acted with the utmost honesty and integrity,\" said Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for Mairone.\nThe case is U.S. ex rel.

        "webpage": "What is a Business Transaction?\nTerry Masters\nEdited By: Allegra J. Lingo\nA business transaction is an exchange of valuables that effects the financial position of a company, such as exchanging money for goods or services. It is the basic activity that defines the status of being in business. Bookkeeping is the process of making a record of all business transactions over time, placed in categories for tax purposes.\nEvery single instance of an exchange of goods or services for valuable consideration, such as money, is a separate business transaction that is important to record in its entirety. The record of transactions is comprised of documents supporting the exchange and the bookkeeping that places the exchange into categories that an accountant can later summarize for financial reporting. This process serves as the basis for many of the business' legal obligations, particularly in regard to taxes.\nMost jurisdictions that tax business sales or income require them by law to keep track of all business transactions. Although the way a business conducts its affairs and manages its bookkeeping is its own decision, tax authorities typically require a business to keep transaction records that are contemporaneous with sales. This means that it is unlikely to be sufficient to recreate a sales record at the end of the year if audited by authorities. The posthumous creation of business transaction records can be illegal when tied to an attempt to defraud the government. Ad\nNational and local governments can assess taxes on sales and income that are wholly dependent on the business correctly reporting all income and substantiating the reporting with its business transaction record. Keeping track of transactions typically entails providing a record of purchase orders or invoices generated and received and any sales receipt issued. In a retail environment, a customer will likely place an order in person and receive a slip of paper as a receipt for the purchase. The store will also generate a copy of the receipt that is kept in its system.\nSales tax, in particular, is so important to governments that assess this type of tax that they pay special attention to companies that transact business mostly in cash. A business transaction can include payment by cash, check, or an electronic method, such as by credit or debit card or through a third party facilitator over the Internet. Cash payments are the only type of payment that does not leave an automatic paper trail. Consequently, cash-heavy businesses are popular vehicles for evading taxes and laundering money.

He did so in Toronto at a press briefing for journalists covering the G20 summit. During the ongoing global financial crisis, banks have already lost 800bn dollars, and this amount is rapidly growing on a weekly basis. These losses \"have to be deducted somewhere\", and governments are concerned that this will heavily affect their corporate tax revenues over the coming years. Moreover, there are indications of \"aggressive tax planning strategies\" applied by banks. These include methods to make losses come to the surface in higher-tax jurisdictions. It could be that some important banks will not have to pay any corporate taxes at all in the coming years, and will even get refunded. Yet, Mr Owens is pleased with the progress made thus far and the constructive attitude of the actors involved. A report is to be released in September. Officials also think of a voluntary code of conduct for banks. Anyway, this issue adds a new dimension to the discussion on bank taxes. Tax and development Mr Owens also made a strong case to consider the relation between tax and development. Although domestic resource mobilisation is on the rise in a number of developing countries, \"aid agencies should pay much more attention to this aspect.\" Support to national tax administration still amounts to only about 0.7 percent of total development assistance. This effort should be increased, as the investment is likely to yield a multiple return. The OECD is becoming actively engaged in the tax and development debate in the framework of the UN Financing for Development process. G20 and tax havens With regard to tax havens, Mr. Owens called this topic a \"G20 success story.\" He emphasised the peer-review process that is now underway in the OECD's Global Forum on transparency and information exchange. The review involves all G20, OECD and offshore jurisdictions. It will first examine legal and regulatory frameworks, and subsequently the actual implementation. The review is to take three years. In answer to a question, he stated that, at this moment, a revision of the criteria to assess compliance with the OECD standard is not on the table. That standard allows for information exchange on request between countries in a way that overrules banking secrecy. In particular the threshold of 12 bilateral tax agreements as an indication of compliance is facing growing criticism. It has made it too easy for certain jurisdictions to move from the G20 black and grey lists to the white list. The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, at a press briefing in Toronto on Saturday just before the G20, suggested that some jurisdictions have met the number of 12 in a way that is not very serious. Possibly, he meant the fact that some tax havens had been concluding agreements with other tax havens or thinly populated jurisdictions such as Greenland. The logical implication of Sarkozy's remark seems to be that there are jurisdictions now on the white list that should not be there. Sarkozy again talked about \"putting non-complying jurisdictions on a black list\", even though the G20 black list got empty shortly after the 2009 London summit. In a reaction, Mr Owens specified that the OECD has never said that reaching 12 agreements is sufficient. Also the implementation has to be looked at, as well as the overall compliance with the spirit of the OECD's standard. The aim of the peer review is exactly to identify any remaining practices that may undermine the effectiveness of the standard. Moreover, \"87 percent of the agreements are between countries which have real economic links, so massive signing of agreements is a sign of real progress.\" Responding to specific questions, he added that places such as Hong Kong, Macau and the State of Delaware, located in powerful G20 countries, will equally be examined. There is a possibility that as a result of the peer review new proposals will be made.

Particular attention was paid to the needs of small states, to create quality jobs, boost growth with resilience and improve their capacity to trade and share tax information. Participants explored ways through which the G20 Development Working Group (DWG) might best support developing countries in generating resilient growth and employment in the context of sustainable development given the challenges presented by the global economy. Speaking at the end of the meeting, Clare Walsh, the head of the DWG for the Australia G20 presidency, outlined the country's priorities for 2014 and welcomed the strong contributions and perspectives from the Commonwealth and La Francophonie countries and international organisations that attended: \"We have found this dialogue to be very enriching, and the insights from colleagues have been extremely useful and very informative. \"The issues presented will feed into the subsequent discussions, and we hope to come out with practical steps to improve the quality of life of our people,\" Walsh said. She stated that Australia considers the Commonwealth and La Francophonie important outreach partners on the G20 agenda, adding that it values the opportunity to hear the two organisations' deep insights arising from their vast experience working on development issues within their diverse membership. Commonwealth Deputy Secretary-General Deodat Maharaj said that advancing the development concerns of its member states and paying particular attention to the needs of small and vulnerable states are an integral part of the the organisation's agenda: \"The Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that working with other partners, like La Francophonie and the Australia G20 Presidency, these concerns continue receiving the attention at the highest possible level of decision and policy making with tangible results. This ongoing dialogue bringing together the 70 developing countries of La Francophonie and the Commonwealth with the G20 is a step in the right direction.\"\nHe added: \"I am pleased that our G20 members were able to listen to some of the most important, urgent and high priority issues from the other members of the wider Commonwealth family. We will continue to pursue, in a consensual manner, the objectives of ensuring that the benefits of globalisation and development accrue to all equitably. He also noted the importance of revisiting the current manner in which small and vulnerable developing countries are classified by the international financial system.\"\nParticipants also highlighted issues of inadequate infrastructure, financing for climate adaptation and mitigation and for energy production. There was also focus on identifying new and innovative ways of raising financing options for development, including through the promotion of public private partnerships as well as domestic resource mobilisation. \"Going forward, we would like to make sure that our membership collectively works towards creating prosperity for all, combating poverty and creating opportunities for young people to be gainfully employed. We fully support growth with equity,\" Maharaj said. Reads: 1686"

W. Bush\nAfter receiving her B.A. from Douglass College of Rutgers University and her Ph.D. from the Fletcher School at Tufts University, Janet Norwood taught at Wellesley College and conducted research in international economics at nearby Tufts. She began working at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1963, and in the next 9 years she spent most of her time in the price office, where she renewed and redeveloped the international price program and managed the consumer price program. She rose rapidly in the ranks as she was named Associate Deputy Commissioner for Data Analysis in 1972, Deputy Commissioner for Data Analysis in 1973, and Deputy Commissioner in 1975. Prior to becoming the Commissioner, Norwood received numerous awards, including the Secretary's Award for Distinguished Achievement (1972), the Secretary's Special Commendation (1977), and the Philip Arnow Award (1979).\nToward the end of Julius Shiskin's tenure as Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner, he became very ill and was unable to perform his duties, so Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall appointed Janet Norwood to be the Acting Commissioner. Shiskin died in October 1978, and in March 1979, President Jimmy Carter nominated Norwood to be the new Commissioner; she was confirmed in May of that year.\nPerhaps the first major accomplishment of the Bureau during Norwood's tenure was the launching of the Continuing Consumer Expenditure Survey, i.e., it was now conducted annually. Although this had been a goal of the Bureau for 25 years, prior to this time the survey had been done only when revisions of the CPI were done, due to a shortage of funds.\nInflation was a severe problem for the country in the late 1970s and motivated the establishment of a House Budget Committee Task Force on Inflation. Debate arose over whether the CPI was overstating the rate of inflation and whether programs indexed to the CPI were receiving too much money. Later in the decade, the Bureau began research on alternative approaches to measurement of homeownership costs in the CPI, a component with substantial weight in the index. After considerable discussion with user groups, the Bureau published five experimental measures of homeownership, including a \"rental equivalence\" measure. This measure was implemented in the CPI-U in 1983 and in the CPI-W in 1985.\nIn 1979, the National Commission on Employment and Unemployment Statistics issued a report that contained approximately 90 recommendations pertaining to the Bureau's employment and unemployment statistics programs. The Bureau put many of them into effect while Norwood was Commissioner. In addition, in January 1982, the Bureau issued \"Linking Employment Problems to Economic Status,\" the first of its annual reports on the subject.\nIn 1983, the Bureau published its first multifactor productivity indexes for major sectors of the private economy, covering the period 1948-81. These estimates measured the annual change in output per unit of combined labor and capital input. Previously, the BLS productivity measurement program had focused on only output per hour of all employees.\nWhen the Employment and Training Administration decided to quit conducting the National Longitudinal Survey, Norwood saved the program by arranging for BLS to take it over. This rich body of data was retained, and surveys continued to keep the information current.\nBy making regular visits to State agencies and having conversations with Governors about the importance of the statistical work done by these agencies, Commissioner Norwood increased the attention given to the Federal-State cooperative programs. She arranged to have funds for the ES-202 program, now the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), transferred to BLS from the Employment and Training Administration and increased the cooperative relationship with the States.\nDuring her time as BLS Commissioner, Norwood consistently strived to promote the professionalism of its employees. She elevated the role of statisticians in BLS to improve the statistical quality of Bureau indicators and increased their participation in professional associations. During her tenure, Norwood served as president of the American Statistical Association (ASA), vice president of the International Statistical Institute (ISI), and a board member of the American Economic Association (AEA). She also pushed for closer contact between BLS staff and the University community.\nCommissioner Norwood established a cognitive laboratory at BLS and developed a memorandum of agreement for cooperation among the laboratories at BLS, the Census Bureau, and the National Center for Health Statistics. This laboratory is now part of the Office of Survey Methods Research, which has made very significant contributions to BLS.\nCertainly, this is an impressive list of achievements, but probably the most important accomplishment Commissioner Norwood made was the assertion of the independence of BLS both from political interference and from the rest of the Labor Department on all scientific matters, personnel decisions, and scientific content of all BLS releases. In emphasizing this assertion in her administration, Norwood very closely reflected the attitude and work of Carroll Wright, the first Commissioner at BLS.\nBack to BLS Commissioners' History."

        "webpage": "| Sun Sep 16, 2012 9:41am BST\nJordan lawmakers clear way for sovereign sukuk\n| By Bernardo Vizcaino\nDUBAI A long-awaited law allowing Jordan to issue sukuk has been cleared by both houses of its parliament, paving the way for the government to tap strong global appetite for Islamic bonds as it tries to repair public finances.The law, which had been in development since 2010, was passed by the lower house of parliament earlier this month and approved by the upper house at the end of last week. It may take effect in about 30 days, after the government promulgates it, Sufian Elhassan, director of the research and information department of the house of representatives, said by telephone.A sovereign sukuk would broaden Jordan's sources of funding, giving it access to a huge pool of Islamic investment funds in the Gulf. Its need for external financing prompted it to agree with the International Monetary Fund in July on a $2 billion stand-by loan arrangement.State finances are under pressure after Jordan hiked subsidies and wages to limit social discontent in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings, and because it is having to absorb tens of thousands of refugees from Syria's civil war.The government is struggling to keep its budget deficit to around 5 percent of gross domestic product this year. In July, Standard and Poor's said its BB credit rating for Jordan had a negative outlook because of the vulnerability of the economy to regional shocks and \"limited fiscal flexibility\".\nIt is not clear when Jordan might issue its first sovereign sukuk, and hurdles remain, including the choice of an asset pool for the sukuk and arranging for the central bank to manage payments on it, said a senior Islamic banker in Amman, who declined to be named because of his bank's briefing rules. Because of Islam's ban on interest, sukuk instead pay returns on funds invested in a pool of assets.The government is keen in principle to tap the domestic and international sukuk markets, the banker said. \"The assumption is that Islamic banks (within the country) would buy 400 million dinars ($565 million) of government issuance.\"\nLast week, Jordan's finance minister said the country was discussing the issue of a seven- to 10-year sovereign, conventional Eurobond worth between $750 million and $1.5 billion to foreign banks.Because global investor demand for sukuk exceeds supply, Jordan might be able to issue Islamic bonds more cheaply than it could sell conventional bonds.INDUSTRY\nJordan has a small but growing Islamic finance industry. Last year local company Al-Rajhi Cement issued an 85 million dinar, seven-year sukuk, the first in the country. Jordan Dubai Islamic Bank began operating in January 2010.In order to facilitate corporate issuance of sukuk in Jordan, the securities commission may seek amendments to the company law and set up a committee to study issues such as compliance with sharia law, a source at the commission said.The committee would include experts on both sukuk and finance in general as well as representatives from the securities commission, the central bank, the ministry of finance and the ministry handling awqaf (Islamic endowments), the source told Reuters.(Editing by Andrew Torchia)"

        "webpage": "Economic Restructuring in New York State\nNote To Editors\nThe latest edition of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Second District Highlights, Economic Restructuring in New York State, is available. This new study by economists Erica Groshen, Simon Potter, and Rebecca Sela concludes that New York State's most recent economic downturn was more severe and persistent than the national recession in part because New York State experienced considerably greater structural change in its labor market than the nation as a whole. November 2001 marked the end of economic decline and the beginning of expansion for the United States; data specific to New York State suggest that New York's economy did not rebound until August 2003. Groshen, Potter, and Sela find that receptiveness to innovative business in New York State has likely heightened the restructuring of the job market. The state ranks high in patented inventions per capita, and several indexes of creativity and innovation that pertain both to the state and to metropolitan areas are similarly high. New and creative start-up business have been attracted to areas, generating new jobs. However, these industries often shed jobs as the industries mature, moving them to relatively lower cost locations. New York State has undergone relatively greater structural change in three of the four past recessions, with downturns in the 1970s, 1990s, and in this most recent recession outlasting the corresponding national downturns. The authors' analysis of data shows this trend increased from the 1970s through the 1990s, by which time 94 percent of all jobs lost were in industries undergoing structural change.In this most recent recession, 67 percent of all New York State jobs were in industries undergoing structural change. This decline in the effect of structural change, the authors find, may have been heightened by the effects of September 11, which accounted for the greater role played by cyclical job loss in this most recent recession relative to the early 1990s. In this most recent recession, industries such as retail trade, leisure and hospitality, and other services were particularly subject to purely temporary job losses that were reversed once the recovery began; these industries were also particularly affected by September 11. Structural change is defined as permanent reallocation of workers across industries and occupations, and has resulted in a decline in manufacturing jobs and a rise in services jobs-fundamental shifts taking place in both New York and the nation. Cyclical change results in temporary job losses, in which laid-off workers can be called back to their old firms or find comparable work elsewhere. Erica Groshen is an assistant vice president in the Research and Market Analysis Group's Domestic Research Function, Simon Potter a research officer in the Business Conditions Function, and Rebecca Sela an assistant economist in the Domestic Research Function.

        "webpage": "Munis Now Offer Promising Investment Potential\nPosted on 07/10/2012 by DispatchAdmin OCEAN CITY  -  Municipal bonds experienced a dramatic surge of interest in the past year. After a brief downturn at the end of 2010, when some analysts were predicting a wave of defaults, the asset class posted a 9.64% return (including both interest payments and price appreciation) in a 12-month period through June 8, 2012.\nWhile municipal returns benefitted from a decline in interest rates that probably won't be repeated, they are still attractive for the tax advantage that they offer over U.S. Treasuries  -  the interest they pay is normally exempt from federal income tax. Today, that makes them a potentially very promising, and very important, investment opportunity.\n\"The opportunity is exaggerated in this period of volatile financial markets and extremely low interest rates,\" says Tom Latta, managing director and global head of Traditional Due Diligence at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"So long as you're selective and you align your choices with your overall investment strategy, munis can provide attractive after-tax income potential.\" It's important, however, to look at the different types of munis and get a clear picture of their unique advantages and risks.\nFor most individual investors, there are two primary categories of municipal bonds: general obligation (GO) bonds and revenue bonds. GO bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the state or local government that issues them, and interest payments to bondholders come from general tax revenues. Revenue bonds are narrower; issued to finance a particular project, such as a stadium or a highway, these munis are funded by the revenues that the project generates. For example, a revenue bond issued to build a bridge might use bridge tolls to pay interest on the bond.\nGO bonds are generally considered to have less risk of the two. One reason is that if a municipality has trouble meeting its obligations, it has the power to levy additional taxes. Another reason is that in order to reduce or eliminate payments to bondholders, a municipality would have to declare bankruptcy, and that is unlikely: States cannot legally do so, and a city or county would seriously jeopardize its ability to borrow money in the future were it to seek bankruptcy protection. Not all GO bonds are created equal, however. For example, GO bonds of a city with a young labor force and a robust economy based on energy production may offer lower risk of default than GO bonds issued by a city with aging workers and a tax base consisting largely of ailing manufacturers.\nRevenue bonds, on the other hand, tend to be more sensitive to economic cycles. For instance, a bond issued to support a sports stadium may suffer if attendance wanes during a recession. Still, revenue bonds supporting essential services, such as wastewater treatment, are likely to remain viable regardless of problems in the larger economy.\nMunicipal bonds are sought after primarily to generate tax-advantaged income potential. And because munis typically have higher credit ratings, they can offset risk in the fixed income portion of your portfolio.\nHigh-quality munis can also add noncorrelated diversification to a broad portfolio, performing well during periods when riskier assets suffer. That's what happened during the last financial crisis. \"In 2008, government and high-quality municipal bonds rose in price while everything else fell because they were perceived as government-supported safe havens,\" Latta says.\nLike most other bonds, municipal bonds are subject to both interest rate risk and credit risk. Interest rate risk is the possibility that a general rise in interest rates will reduce the price of an existing security. This is important for municipal bonds because of their long maturities; most munis are typically issued with terms of 10 or 30 years.\nConsider how municipal bond trades work. Dealers build a cushion into their price to cover the time between buying and selling a security. That cushion, called the bid-offer spread, widens when dealers think they may have to hold the bonds longer. For example, a credit downgrade for a municipality would reduce demand for a dealer's bonds, triggering an increase in the bid-offer spread or the dealer's willingness to buy and hold such bonds.\nAlthough municipal bonds can add diversification, investors sometimes unwittingly increase their risk by concentrating in bonds issued by their own state, Latta warns.\nMunicipal bonds' relatively safe, tax-efficient income may help investors capture greater after-tax yield without a potentially significant increase in risk. It's important to note that the sector does present potential pitfalls, which must be managed carefully.\n\"We may not be facing a sweeping decline in credit quality,\" Latta says, \"but investors still need to have a firm understanding of the bonds they are considering to make the most of them in any smart financial strategy.\"\n(A Merrill Lynch Wealth Management Advisor, who can be reached at 410-213-8520.)"

        "webpage": "updated: 1/29/2013 11:56 AM\nReport: States force jobless to pay needless fees\nPeople use a Bank of America ATM in Boston. Banks including JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America seized on government payments for unemployment compensation as a business opportunity and pitched card programs to many states. However to cover the costs of the programs, banks have hit all card users with a plethora of new fees.\nWASHINGTON -- Jobless Americans are paying millions in unnecessary fees to collect unemployment benefits because of state policies encouraging them to get the money through bank-issued payment cards, according to a new report from a consumer group.\nPeople are using the fee-heavy cards instead of getting their payments deposited directly to their bank accounts. That's because states issue bank cards automatically, require complicated paperwork or phone calls to set up direct deposit and fail to explain the card fees, according to a report issued Tuesday by the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit group that seeks to protect low-income Americans from unfair financial-services products. An early copy of the report was obtained by The Associated Press.\nUntil the past decade, states distributed unemployment compensation by mailing out paper checks. Some also allowed direct deposit. The system worked well for people who had bank accounts and could deposit the check without paying a fee.\nIt also cost states millions of dollars each year to print and mail the checks.\nBanks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America Corp. seized on government payments as a business opportunity. They pitched card programs to states as a win-win: States would save millions in overhead costs because the cards would be issued for free. And people without bank accounts would avoid the big fees charged by storefront check cashers.\nHowever, most of the people being hit with fees already have bank accounts. The bank-state partnerships effectively shifted the cost of distributing payments from governments to individuals. The money needed to cover those costs is deducted from people's unemployment benefits in the form of fees.\nConsumer advocates like NCLC are focused on ensuring access to the direct-deposit option so that people can avoid the card fees.\nThe trouble, the new report says, is that many states make it difficult for people to sign up for direct deposit. The rate of people using direct deposit ranges from a national high of 82 percent in Minnesota to a low of 16 percent in Arizona, the report says.\nMinnesota offers direct deposit to people when they apply for benefits, and allows them to change their payment method online or over the phone, the report says.\nIn Arizona, by contrast, people are automatically enrolled in the card program. After they receive the card, they must find a paper form, fill it out, and submit it by mail. There is no way to change payment methods online or over the phone.\n\"The difference in direct-deposit rates among states seems primarily due to how hard or easy the state makes it for workers to choose direct deposit,\" the report says.\nIn five states -- California, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland and Nevada -- unemployed people aren't offered direct deposit at all. The report says that setup is illegal under a federal law that bars states from requiring benefits recipients to open an account at a particular bank.\nThe federal government recommended in 2009 that people with bank accounts receive payments via direct deposit. Nearly four years later, the report says, \"there is no excuse for any state not to be offering direct deposit as the first choice for payment of unemployment benefits.\"\nBanks make more money when more people use the cards. In the past, some of their deals with states prevented states from offering direct deposit, or required states to promote the card program as a first option.\nTo cover the cost of issuing cards and running the programs, banks charge a plethora of fees, including charges for balance inquiries, phone calls to customer support, leaving an account inactive for a period of months, or making a purchase using a personal identification number.\nMany states have eliminated some fees and improved consumer protections in the two years since NCLC published its first comprehensive review of state unemployment payments. Banks no longer charge overdraft fees, which skimmed up to $20 from the benefits of card users whose spending exceeded the balance on the card.\nPennsylvania was singled out for praise in the report. Residents of that state will save $5.2 million in card fees each year because the state switched to a lower-fee card.\nIn part because of the recent improvements, the report says, prepaid cards often are the best option for people who don't have bank accounts. Those people would often pay even bigger fees to storefront check cashing services.\n\"A well-designed prepaid card is safer, cheaper and more convenient than paying to cash a paper check,\" said Lauren Saunders, one of the report's authors, in a prepared statement. But she said \"it is no substitute for direct deposit to an account of your own choosing.\""

        "webpage": "Countdown to SEPA\nLagging SEPA implementation leaves companies at risk of payment disruptions.\nBy Susan Kelly May 13, 2013 \u2022 Reprints\nAs the February 2014 deadline for switching to the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) format approaches, there are growing doubts that companies will be ready in time, raising the prospect of a disruption in euro-denominated payments.\nThe European Community was the latest to chime in, warning in March that while most companies have done their planning for SEPA, many were looking at very late deadlines for making the changes required.\nLesley White, head of treasury products for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, recently participated in a roadshow across the United States where SEPA was among the topics discussed. \"The key message was, if you don't think about [SEPA] now, you're not going to be able to make or receive payments,\" she said. \"You could see the light come on in people's eyes.\"\n\"As of February 2014, those local instruments that go through local clearing will be decommissioned,\" White said. \"As of February 2014, it will be the SEPA credit transfers and SEPA direct debits that the biller uses to collect from the payer, that they will need to use.\"\nIn January, PwC issued a report suggesting that 55% of companies risk missing the February 2014 deadline. However, Peter Frank, a principal at PwC and leader of its Corporate Treasury Solutions practice, said the situation may not be as dire as it's painted.\n\"To make a SEPA transfer, the payment file needs to be in a certain format, ISO 20022,\" Frank said. Companies are working on the internal changes that would allow them to generate files in that format, but if they don't complete the work by Feb. 1, \"a lot of the banks are offering services to convert the files on their behalf,\" he said. \"You could send a non-compliant format to the bank and the bank will take that file and convert it,\" he said.\nWhile that allows companies to go on making payments, Frank said that having the bank convert payment files will mean higher transaction costs. And if large numbers of companies decide to rely on banks to convert payment files, the volume could overwhelm banks. \"I think there's an open question as to the banks' capacity to do it, that is, their internal processing capacity,\" Frank said.\nWhite said BofA is well prepared, noting that the bank has \"an end-to-end business plan around how we support our clients through SEPA migration,\" a plan that takes \"bottlenecks and resources challenges into account. I do think though that those that leave it to the last minute are absolutely risking not getting the right support,\" she said.\nPwC's survey of 293 finance executives in December and January showed that 22% of companies had not yet planned their SEPA implementation. Even those who put together plans had holes in those plans: for example, fewer than 20% had included the company's HR, legal and sales departments in their planning. And 44% of those with plans had deadlines that PwC describes as \"uncomfortably close\" to the February 2014 deadline.\nBofA's White, pictured at left, said she sees different levels"

To set up a private cloud, a company must have a number of servers and be able to run any application on those servers, among other differentiating factors, Birnbaum said.\"I want to be able to move that thing around, quickly run that application on 10 or 1,000 computers, workload manage the entire complex,\" Birnbaum said. \"It's the software layer of workload management and smart placement of applications that separates it [from a typical data center].\"\nDavid Crosbie, [cq] CTO of virtualization software provider Leostream, agreed that \"starting internally is really the only way to get going\" on cloud computing, particularly because there currently are no standards in place to govern how cloud-computing networks operate in terms of security, business processes, governance and the like.A group of technology vendors and other companies -- including IBM, Cisco, Sun Microsystems and VMware -- last week came together to launch the Open Cloud Manifesto, a publicly released document that attempts to set some standards for how cloud-computing networks interoperate.But the group's mission and endeavor has been controversial from the get-go because AWS and Microsoft, among others, were left out of the process of drafting the document, and Microsoft chose to reveal the existence of the manifesto before IBM and others were ready to go public about it.On the panel Monday Linda Bernardi, [cq] founder of IT consulting firm StraTerra Partners, defended the Open Cloud Manifesto, saying that its aim is to open a discussion about setting parameters for cloud-computing, not to be the end all, be all for how cloud-computing should work.\"The idea was to begin to identify the core advantages and challenges and make sure we bring end-user customers into the process,\" she said.Bernardi said it won't merely be a group of large technology vendors that ultimately defines how cloud computing is implemented. \"it's going to be a process,\" she said.\"Enterprises, companies - be it banks, manufacturing companies - big companies will define what cloud computing is,\" Bernardi said. \"It can't be determined by a vendor or set of vendors.\"\nTags private cloudscloud computing\nElizabeth Montalbano"

        "webpage": "Overcoming the Bamboo Ceiling\nParticipants at Asia Society's second annual Diversity Leadership Forum in New York City on May 17, 2010. (Elsa Ruiz/Asia Society) By Vishakha N. Desai\nOriginally published in Huffington Post on July 21, 2010\nNEW YORK, July 21, 2010 - Engineers, accountants, and computer programmers - but not CEOs. That's the prevalent image of Asians in American corporate life, and calls are growing to dismantle the so-called \"bamboo ceiling\" impeding Asian American career advancement once and for all.\nJust like the \"glass ceiling\" from which it takes its name, the \"bamboo ceiling\" isn't an official barrier or policy but is a perception rooted in reality. Statistics show Asian Pacific Americans are the fastest growing ethnic group with ever-rising purchasing power and - as a group - the most educated employees. Yet, they are still underrepresented in corporate leadership. The number of Asian Pacific Americans who served as chair, vice chair, president, or CEO of a Fortune 500 company last year: seven.\nWhy is this happening, and what can be done? At Asia Society, we recently commissioned a survey of workers at Fortune 500 companies and found that Asian Pacific Americans overwhelming care about the futures of their companies (88 percent). They also gave high marks to their companies' diversity efforts. Yet just 55 percent said their firms capitalize on the perspectives and talents of their Asian Pacific American workers. What's more, in an age of globalization, less than one-third (31 percent) said their companies encourage employees to pursue careers in Asia - despite language skills, cultural knowledge, and family links.\nAnother disparity can be seen in the fields where Asian Pacific Americans are employed. Nearly half of survey respondents work in financial- or technology-related departments and, overall, the survey found they are less likely to feel they are able to fully use all of their skill sets or feel they have opportunities for career growth and development.\nTo a certain extent, career roadblocks are rooted in ethnic stereotypes. Asian Pacific Americans are often depicted as \"hardworking,\" \"non-confrontational,\" or \"good at math and science\" - stereotypes with positive characteristics, to be sure, but like all stereotypes they can box people in to certain roles and, in turn, can cause people to limit themselves.\nThis has to stop. In an era where global business opportunities demand fast action and varied perspectives, marshalling the skills of a diverse workforce would seem like a no-brainer - and an area where America offers a competitive advantage.\nBy easing the way for Asian Pacific Americans to climb the corporate ladder, companies can reward dedication and maximize these workers' contributions to corporate growth at home and abroad - whether through professional skill development, support of employee resource groups, mentoring, or building ties with Asian communities and Asian markets.\nOverall, Asians in America are a young population, and our tale is still being written. We are ourselves a diverse group, and we find - over time - that what brings us together is really our common American experience rather than our Asian origins.\nBreaking down the bamboo ceiling to allow employees and employers alike to reach their fullest potential must be part of our American story.\nVishakha N. Desai is president of the Asia Society, which recently completed its first Asian Pacific Americans Corporate Survey."

Sweeney (D-West Deptford) had proposed to accomplish those goals through a constitutional amendment  -  which would evade the looming veto pen of Gov. Chris Christie, but face even more intense opposition from the state's business associations  -  he recently agreed to support the Assembly-approved measure that will be considered in the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee today.Kathleen A. Davis, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey, said the legislative provision to automatically increase the minimum wage every year according to inflation is \"still very troublesome to us,\" though she said \"having the opportunity to have our thoughts and concerns weighed is certainly a better way to go than a 'yes or no' question going to voters to make this issue part of our constitution.\"\"This is a very complex and far-reaching issue, so I think that going through the legislative process provides more opportunities for input from the business community in terms of what this increase will mean to them, especially to small businesses,\" Davis said.Davis said a January 2012 survey of the chamber's members found the top reason why businesses oppose the measure is the impact it would have on consumer prices, as any increase in labor costs would get passed on to customers and make a company's products and services less competitive.Some business groups have noted that the shore's tourism industry was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy, and argue the minimum wage increase would amount do a double blow, but Samia Bahsoun, a steering committee member at the small business group Main Street Alliance, made the opposite point, saying the extra income in low-wage workers' pockets would translate into new spending and help the economy.\"So the ripple effect of just this additional dollar... would tremendously impact small biz, and we know that we all need it here on the Jersey Shore,\" she said.According to the New Jersey Time to Care Coalition, which supports the bill sponsored by Assembly Speaker Sheila Y. Oliver (D-East Orange) and other Assembly members, if the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would currently be more than $10 an hour, compared to the $7.25 an hour rate it is today.Oliver said lawmakers are capable of helping businesses and low-wage workers at the same time.\"We are going to be there for those business owners,\" she said. \"We are going to be promulgating a variety of initiatives to help support them, and I do not believe that in order to support businesses that have been ravaged by Sandy it means that we cannot elevate the minimum wage for low income workers in this state.\"Oliver challenged her fellow legislators to pass the bill, noting that the state has in recent years provided numerous incentives to businesses and arguing \"it is time to turn attention to the people that make business prosperous, and it is the people that work within those businesses.\"To voice its concerns to the Legislature, the chamber has joined a coalition of 11 state business groups led by the New Jersey Business & Industry Association to testify against the bill at today's Senate committee hearing.In her prepared testimony, Stefanie Riehl, NJBIA assistant vice president, said the coalition is especially concerned about the proposed minimum wage increase after witnessing Hurricane Sandy's impact on businesses, and hearing that \"many of our employers are still focusing on making payroll and how they can make their workers whole following the losses they've incurred.\"\"Thousands of employers have a long and difficult task in rebuilding their businesses and getting people back to work. Just getting back to where they were is going to be hard enough,\" Riehl said in a statement Friday. \"Lawmakers shouldn't raise the bar even higher.\"Contributing: Jared Kaltwasser"

        "webpage": "Global Government and Business Leaders Unveil New Climate Economy\nBy Christian Bonawandt\nEnvironmental and economic policies have almost always been at odds with each other. Many businesses and government groups see environmental legislation as stifling and overbearing, destroying jobs and preventing economic growth. But a new global council of environmental scientists and economists, led by an impressive cross section of world leaders and policymakers, hopes to allay those concerns.\nThe Global Commission on the Economy and Climate is composed of leaders from government, finance, and business. The commission is a partnership of seven economic and policy research institutes located in the U.S., China, Europe, India, Korea, and Ethiopia. It is overseen by an international council of former heads of government and finance ministers, as well as business leaders. Its flagship project is the New Climate Economy, which aims to produce better and more comprehensive evidence on whether strong economic performance can be supported by good environmental policy, and if so, how. The report, slated to be published in September 2014, will make recommendations on how the public and private sectors can achieve lower-carbon economic growth. The commission will then take its findings directly to heads of government and business leaders throughout the world in what the group calls a \"systematic outreach strategy.\"\nFelipe Calderon, former president of Mexico and chair of the international council overseeing the project, said at a news conference in New York, \"Most economic analysis still does not properly factor in the increasing risks of climate change or the potential benefits of acting on it.\"\nCalderon said there does not need to be a trade off of job creation in order to fight climate change. \"We urgently need to identify how we can achieve economic growth and job creation while also reducing emissions and tackling climate change,\" he said.\nCalderon emphasized that the commission intends to approach its research without preconceived notions, and that it would draw its conclusions strictly from the data. \"We are completely open to the scientific conclusions,\" he said.\nA partnership of research institutes across six continents will carry out the analysis:\nClimate Policy Initiative\nEthiopian Development Research Institute\nGlobal Green Growth Institute\nIndian Council for Research on International Economic Relations\nStockholm Environmental Institute\nTsinghua University\nOther members of the oversight council include:\nIngrid Bonde\nChief Financial Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Vattenfall\nSharan Burrow\nGeneral Secretary, International Trade Union Confederation\nAdmnistrator, UN Development Progamme, and former Prime Minister of New Zealand\nLu\u00edsa Diogo\nFormer Prime Minister of Mozambique, and Chairperson of the Board of Directors, Barclays Bank Mozambique\nS.

        "webpage": "Donald Marron Print this pageShare: | E-mailDocument date: February 22, 2012Released online: March 13, 2012\nIn a contribution to the Christian Science Monitor, Donald Marron discusses the six-pack of expiring temporary tax cuts which could provide the incentive to reshape the tax code and boost the budget. Christian Science Monitor\nUS Budget: Fiscal Showdown or Kick the Can?\nIt's a shame that can-kicking isn't an Olympic sport. Imagine America's elected leaders facing off against their European counterparts in a contest to see who can avoid difficult decisions the longest.\nMy money would be on the Americans. Our team has taken the game to a new level in recent years and is ready to shine on this year's Olympic stage. At home, however, it's not clear whether that can-kicking prowess will end in gold or tears.\nDespite its bad reputation, can-kicking is sometimes the best we can do. Putting off long-term decisions makes sense, for example, when the world is riven with uncertainty. If you aren't careful, however, you will find your path littered with unresolved issues.\nThat's where we are on fiscal issues today. Start with our tattered tax code, which now contains a six-pack of temporary tax cuts. The largest are the Bush-era cuts originally enacted in 2001 and 2003 that were scheduled to expire in 2010. Rather than decide their fate, President Obama and Congress extended them another two years.\nThat legislation also included additional tax cuts championed by Mr. Obama and an estate tax compromise, all of which expire - along with the original tax cuts - at the end of 2012.\nThen there's the dreaded alternative minimum tax. It expired Dec. 31, but Congress for years has passed an annual \"patch\" preventing the AMT from hitting more middle-class families. A hodgepodge of temporary tax breaks known, tellingly, as the \"extenders,\" also expired at the end of last year, but many lawmakers and beneficiaries want to bring them back. Various stimulus measures, including the payroll tax holiday and corporate investment incentives, are set to lapse soon, too.\nThe expiration of those six packages of tax cuts, plus the arrival of some new taxes created in the health reform legislation, would boost tax revenues sharply in the next few years. The Congressional Budget Office projects that tax revenues will increase from $2.3 trillion in fiscal 2011 to $3.3 trillion in 2014 if all these scheduled changes occur. That trillion-dollar increase, a 44 percent gain, would far outstrip the expected 11 percent growth of the economy.\nIt's hard to imagine that lawmakers will actually let that happen. As the CBO itself notes, such a sharp increase would weaken the economy at a time when it's struggling to recover from the Great Recession.\nOn the spending side of the ledger, the most egregious example of can-kicking is the formula by which Medicare sets payments for doctors. That formula has called for dramatic cuts for years. But every time those cuts come near, Congress overrides them temporarily, and often \"pays for\" that by scheduling even bigger cuts in the future. That's why doctors face a 27 percent cut in payment rates at the end of March and more in years ahead.\nAnd then there are across-the-board spending cuts, spread over nine years, that are scheduled to begin next January. Congress didn't really intend those cuts to happen; instead, they were meant to pressure last year's \"super committee\" to find real budget savings. That didn't occur, and now Washington is rife with speculation that policymakers will flinch from letting the cuts go through, at least until the economy strengthens. Lawmakers will thus face a tempting lineup of cans later this year. But preventing any of the scheduled tax increases and spending cuts will require new legislative action at a time when the two parties find it hard to agree on almost anything.\nYears of can-kicking have set the stage for a dramatic fiscal showdown after the elections or early in the new year. Lawmakers could take this opportunity to shape a tax code and federal spending that make sense for 21st-century America. Or they can settle for more clank-clank-clank.\nTopics/Tags: | Economy/Taxes Related PublicationsReforming State Gas Taxes Municipal Debt: What Does It Buy and Who Benefits?

        "webpage": "Don't cry for Cristina\nWill next week's crisis be in Argentina?\nCristina Kirchner to vulture funds: Hasta la vista, suckers!(AP Photo/Eduardo Di Baia)\nMidnight last night was the final deadline for Argentina's government to come up with a plan to pay bondholders or face a default on its foreign debt. Perhaps jealous of all the attention Cyprus is getting, it seems to be leaning toward the latter option.\nThe deadline came as part of a long legal confrontation between the South American country and a group of \"hold-out\" investors. The investors snapped up Argentina's debt on the cheap and want it paid back in full, unlike earlier bondholders who agreed to take a partial loss, or \"haircut.\" A US federal court considering the merits of the two sides' arguments essentially gave Argentina two choices: Come up with a plan to pay all of its creditors, including the hold-outs, or pay none of them, resulting in at least a temporary default.\nWhen a three-judge panel issued that ruling a month ago, some experts wondered if it could open a door for a kind of sovereign bankruptcy court that could force the hold-out investors to accept payment on a more leisurely schedule. Others saw the court forcing Argentina to go on the record officially refusing to compromise. Instead, Argentina has offered up a plan to exchange the hold-out investors' bonds for new ones with a 25-year maturity and a roughly 70% haircut - pretty much the same deal it offered other bondholders.\nThat's not exactly what the court, or the investors, are looking for. With the deadline for its next bond payment coming tomorrow, if judges do nothing the country could end up in arrears by Monday - which, perhaps fittingly, is April Fool's Day - and thus in default.\nThat, in turn, would be very bad for the country's economy. It's already cut off from most foreign borrowing and investment, thanks to repeated defaults and a nasty habit of nationalizing foreign companies. Today, Argentinian inflation is near 30%, according to independent estimates (nobody believes the official figure of 11%), and that has everything to do with its battles with foreign creditors.\n\"Because Argentina can only borrow in domestic markets, it has done what countries around the world do when they have financing burdens that global markets won't absorb, and that is create bank reserves for their own financial institutions to buy the debt,\" says Robert Shapiro, an economist who chairs an American group seeking to end the standoff and normalize trade relations with Argentina. \"By creating these bank reserves, they inflated the money supply and that's helped drive the inflation up.\"\nEarlier this month, Brazilian mining giant Vale suspended a $6 billion mining project after inflation and exchange rate fluctuations drove up the cost.\nRefusing to pay the foreign \"vulture funds\" that took Argentina to court has become a political touchstone for Cristina Kirchner, the country's fiercely nationalistic president. But she would do well to find a way to end the debt standoff, Josh Rosner, managing director at Graham, Fischer and Co., told the Associated Press:\nThe government could say \"you know what, we fought for what we thought was fair and equitable, but for the greater good of Argentina, we have to put this in our past so we can normalize our relations with international markets...at the end of the day the only way we can protect the lives of the Argentines we have sworn to protect is by not going down this dangerous path.\""

        "webpage": "This Just In Economic growth expected to slow in New England\nStaff, wire reports | November 17,2013\nFederal spending cuts and reduced consumer demand are slowing economic growth in New England, according to new projections, but Vermont\ufffds outlook is among the best in the region.The report by the New England Economic Partnership, a nonprofit group that provides analyses and forecasts, said economic growth of 3 percent through 2017 is less than what\ufffds considered even moderate. Mathew Barewicz, economic and labor market information chief for the Vermont Department of Labor, argued that other states would be expected to have higher growth rates coming out of the recession because they have more to recover than Vermont does.Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts are expected to continue to boast the strongest economies in the region in the next four years.In addition, employment growth of 2 percent in the six New England states will be below the national average. Massachusetts has recovered jobs lost in the 18-month recession from December 2007 to June 2009 and Vermont will soon follow.Barewicz pointed out that Vermont was currently tied for the fifth-lowest unemployment rate in the country.\ufffdVermont was definitely hit during this last recession but we were not hit as hard as a number of other states and we have weathered the storm fairly well,\ufffd he said. Ross Gittell, manager of the New England forecast, said the greater Boston area has been a bright spot in the New England economy, leading the region in job growth and more than recovering the jobs lost in the recession.The strong Boston economy also has propelled Massachusetts to lead New England states in economic performance, he said. About one-third of the state\ufffds jobs recovery can be attributed to employment gains in the Boston metropolitan area.Barewicz said Burlington, which could be considered Vermont\ufffds equivalent of Boston, was also doing well.\ufffdBoston has certainly experienced a lot of job growth ... as has Burlington in the labor market area,\ufffd he said. \ufffdWhen you look at the Burlington labor market area, that area is well beyond where it was in 2007. It\ufffds 2 to 3 percent above where it was.\ufffdWhile Barewicz said Vermont has still not recovered all the jobs lost since 2007, the state is less than 1 percent away from that recovery goal.Vermont\ufffds diversified economy, which includes manufacturing, private and public education, health care and leisure and hospitality, keeps it from experiencing the extreme up and down swings seen in other states, he said.With slow employment growth elsewhere in the region, the unemployment rate in New England is expected to decline gradually, from 6.7 percent in this year\ufffds third quarter to 6.4 percent in late 2014 and to below 6 percent in the first quarter of 2016. Unemployment in 2017 is expected to be lowest in Vermont (3.7 percent) and New Hampshire (3.3 percent). Joblessness is expected to be 6.1 percent in Rhode Island and 6 percent in Maine. Connecticut is expected to have the region\ufffds highest unemployment rate, 6.5 percent, by 2017.The region\ufffds unemployment rate in mid-2017 is expected to be 5.4 percent. That\ufffds a significant decline from the peak of 8.7 percent in 2010, but still above the pre-recession rate of 5 percent in the second quarter of 2008.Herald reporter Patrick McArdle contributed to this story."

Without using the predictive power of analytics, it isn't possible to prevent fraud before it happens.\nJohannesburg, South Africa (30 Sep. 2013)\n- By Colin Hill, senior solution manager, Financial Crimes and Risk Solutions, SAS South Africa.\nThe majority of large companies have fraud budgets in place. These budgets are not, as you might expect, for detecting or combating fraud, but rather, simply, for absorbing the costs of fraud when it is committed.\nI've had risk managers proudly tell me that they are within their fraud budget for the year, which is a disingenuous comment for them to make, considering that a fraud budget that allows for \"acceptable\" levels of fraud is nothing to be proud of - even if the department comes in under budget.\nOf course, anti-fraud measures do exist, but they tend to take the form of careful screening of job applicants and customers, and educational campaigns. None of these are utilising the vast potential of technology to detect - but more importantly to prevent - fraud, and to protect the reputation of the business.\nThere are three key areas in which technology can make a difference:\nFraud perpetrators are becoming more sophisticated. Fraud syndicates have state-of-the-art technology, and the extremely qualified computer programmers and statisticians. In addition, the latest Kroll report published in the United States indicates that 60% of fraud committed has an internal link in the organisation.\nIf you take all of this into account, its absolute madness that organisations aren't dedicating the same levels of expertise and technology to preventing and combating internal and external fraud. If a company's controls and mechanisms are not of the latest design, this could mean that multiple layers of firewalls and authentication layers are not of a high standard.\nHackers could get into the systems, and transact, steal information or even destroy the systems. Antivirus software and detection controls should be in place and should be tested regularly by external parties specializing in hacking prevention.\nOnly reporting the number of attacks, and having a budget in place to absorb the fraud is leaving the company open to repeated attacks, and doing nothing to solve the ongoing problem. The impact of fraud on the company is more than just a financial loss it impacts companies much wider than just having the ability to detect the fraud and catching the perpetrator. Impacts to the company strategic objective, customer impact, data handling capability, risk management process, compliance risk etc. should be assessed as well.\nIt seems like a no-brainer to say that an organisation should have mechanisms in place to detect fraud. But many organisations still use the outdated model of understanding the modus operandi of a fraudster who has been caught and questioned, and using this set of rules to pick up similar activities.\nThe chances of another fraudster using the same mechanisms are very slim. Instead, companies should be using advanced statistical methods to scroll through large amounts of data in a short period of time and alert the business to possible acts of fraud. These methods don't rely on previous incidents of fraud, but rather on detecting behaviour that is out of the ordinary.\nThe big question here is: can you do this in a big data environment, and at what cost and speed?\nMany organisations do not show fraud as a line item on their balance sheet - it is often hidden in credit losses or some operational loss. But fraud isn't only a financial loss or a broken control that needs to be evaluated as part of the operational risk management process.\nAny individual customer's loss due to fraud, as well as any massive company-wide breach is a threat to a company's reputation. Businesses are failing to measure the impact on their customers, their reputations and their entire business models of leaving themselves open to fraud by budgeting for it rather than detecting and preventing it.\nCustomers need to feel safe, and they need to be confident that their information is protected.\nSimply put, not having the proper technology in place to detect and prevent fraud before it happens is leaving companies vulnerable, allowing fraudulent activities to continue and fraudulent employees to keep their jobs, and leaving customers feeling insecure about their assets and personal information.\nFuture articles in this series will look at reputation management in greater depth, company strategy and data and information management.\nSAS is the leader in business analytics software and services, and the largest independent vendor in the business intelligence market.

Figures for 2013 are projections.\nIHS Global Insight\nOnline retail sales are cutting into tax revenue in counties and cities, according to a report issued by the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Friday. They estimate the lost revenue for America's largest cities and counties came to about $2.8 billion for 2011 and 2012, combined. The mayors' group released the report as they hold their annual meeting in Las Vegas. The topic of tax revenues has come up for discussion, particularly the Marketplace Fairness Act, a U.S. bill that would allow states to collect sales tax on online transactions. The report estimating lost revenues is available online. Among the cities studied, New York City is estimated to have missed out on the most amount of money, at more than $205 million in 2012. Phoenix follows with $18 million; Chicago is next, with $17 million. In terms of counties, the report prepared for the conference by IHS Global Insight says that Los Angeles County could have had an extra $82 million if it were able to collect sales taxes in 2012. Chicago's Cook County was next, at $48 million; six other counties were estimated to have lost out on more than $20 million in tax revenue. In the cities and counties that the study focused on, the local governments collect from 0.1 percent to around 6 percent in sales tax, in addition to state taxes. The analysis estimated the amount of taxes that were not assessed on online sales \"by determining the share of e-commerce originating from a given county or city and applying the appropriate local tax rate,\" according to the report. Sales that were made through more traditional sources, like catalogs, were not included in the calculations. The study's authors say they used the same methods researchers developed in a 2009 report titled \"State and Local Government Sales Tax Revenue Losses from Electronic Commerce,\" compiled by business professors at the University of Tennessee. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, the president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, has said he sees taxes on online transactions as a way to pay for infrastructure repairs, and to stimulate economic growth. \"With federal funds to local governments dwindling and few other sources available to municipal leaders for raising revenue, this measure will provide a badly needed funding stream so we can better serve our residents,\" Nutter said last month, \"from fixing crumbling roads and bridges to funding schools and first responders to maintaining and upgrading water systems.\" The mayors' support of the Marketplace Fairness Act echoes that of many brick-and-mortar retail groups, which have complained that customers use their stores to get the look and feel of products  -  which they then buy later on bargain websites. Since a 1992 Supreme Court ruling, retailers have been allowed to skip collecting sales tax on transactions with customers in states where they have no physical presence. As we reported earlier this week, Amazon has cut ties with its affiliates in Minnesota in a move it blamed on the state's new sales tax law that takes effect in July. The company said it would return to Minnesota if the Marketplace Fairness Act were enacted. But not every online retailer is in favor of the measure as it is currently written. Critics say it would impose heavy burdens on small online retailers, who could face compliance issues and varying tax rates in states far from their base of operations. Others say the bill's minimum cutoff of $1 million in sales is too low. In a statement to Congress, online auction site eBay has urged \"the Small Business Administration to determine the threshold that accurately reflects a small business,\" noting that the agency's current threshold for giving loans to online retailers is $30 million. The company goes on to say that it believes \"small businesses that use the Internet are not the ones jeopardizing offline small businesses. The greatest threat to any small business retailer is its mega-large competitor.\" But the debate over the Marketplace Fairness Act is anything but simple. As Time reported last month, the Alliance for Main Street Fairness group has attacked eBay for its position against the bill, saying the company is only hoping to protect the largest businesses that use its auction site. The bill has been approved by the Senate and is currently in the House Judiciary Committee. The panel's chairman, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., has said he doesn't think the bill's tax collection process \"is sufficiently simplified yet.\"Copyright 2013 NPR. To see more, visit . View the discussion thread."

        "webpage": "Companies Are Evil, So It's OK to Lie about Them\nPresident Obama presented himself to the nation in 2008 as something new -- a change agent who would bring fresh ideas to our national challenges and solve problems in a post-partisan, unifying fashion. In fact, as some noted at the time, his ideas were decrepit hand-me-downs, about as novel as disco or the leisure suit. He is a conventional, left-wing statist, George McGovern with a bigger smile, eager to bring ever-larger segments of American life under tight government control and direction. As for unity, his presidency has set new records for contemning the opposition -- a disdain histrionically pantomimed by Joe Biden. Obama's deep hostility to the private sector has been evident throughout his presidency and popped up like verbal ticks during the first debate. He warned against putting seniors \"like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system.\" Those companies, he added knowingly, \"are pretty clever about figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.\" He trotted out his old warhorse about companies \"getting tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas,\" and he claimed that Obamacare protects people from \"being jerked around\" by insurance companies. So hostile is the president to insurance companies that he stooped to misrepresenting the facts of his mother's illness and death the better to paint them as malevolent. In a 2008 debate with John McCain, Obama said this: \"For my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.\"\nView Cartoon As Janny Scott, a former New York Times reporter, revealed in her biography of Stanley Ann Dunham Obama, it didn't happen. Mrs. Obama's medical expenses were paid for by CIGNA. There was a dispute with the company over disability insurance, but the company never attempted to deny coverage for her cancer treatment. When the White House was questioned about the Scott account, a spokesman did not dispute it, saying that it was all a very long time ago. Obamacare was designed by people who believe passionately that private companies must be strictly controlled and regulated by Washington bureaucrats, who will run things far more humanely and even more efficiently. Mr. Obama cited the bogus statistic that Medicare has \"lower administrative costs\" than the private sector. This is specious. Medicare's administrative costs are spread over several different agencies. The IRS collects the taxes that fund the program, the Social Security Administration collects some of the premiums paid by beneficiaries, and the Department of Health and Human Services handles accounting, auditing, fraud and other issues. Additionally, Medicare's population is older and sicker than the typical insurance pool. Their medical costs are accordingly higher, so as a percentage of total spending on the patient, Medicare's per patient administrative costs will be smaller. But that isn't because Medicare is more efficient. This is not to say that insurance companies are virtuous. They are simply businesses, doing what makes sense for their customers and shareholders. It would never occur to Barack Obama that the best way to go after insurance companies whose behavior you dislike is to provide competitors. No, his plan, now just beginning to sting, is to create 159 new bureaus and agencies, and 11,327 pages of new regulations (so far). Any first-year economics student could have predicted what happened last week in response to one feature of the law. Obamacare requires that companies with 50 or more full-time employees provide health insurance or pay a fine. A restaurant chain that includes Olive Garden and Red Lobster (not one of the 1200 well-connected companies and unions who've received waivers) announced that it will be placing more of its 180,000 employees on part-time status -- thereby diminishing the salaries of thousands of people. The Obama Administration will perhaps regard this utterly predictable response (and this is just the beginning) as \"jerking people around,\" and may, if reelected, issue regulations making it illegal to change an employee's status from full-time to part-time. That's how statists operate. Try firing someone in France -- which is why jobs are so scarce in France. And so it will go, with the federal government chasing after private industry with more and more restrictions and penalties -- never seeing that they are circling the drain.\nShare this on Facebook Tweet Tags: Medicare"

Coming from Japan, where men outnumber women at universities by almost six to one in her discipline, Takeda had almost abandoned the idea of a career in academia when she was studying economics in college.She wanted to go to grad school, but \"I just couldn't imagine how I could build a career in the field,\" Takeda, 41, said in an interview in Tokyo. She had no female role models in Japan, \"absolutely zero,\" she said.So she began applying for jobs in business while still a student at the University of Tokyo. Then she learned she had won one of the top awards for her thesis, giving her the courage to pursue her dream of post-graduate studies on Russia at the college. It was the first step in a career that led Takeda to the former Soviet states and to write a book on poverty that re-examined economic thinking on the development of wealth gaps, winning her the Masayoshi Ohira Memorial Prize last year.The award, named after a former Japanese prime minister, recognizes books on politics, economics, culture and technology that advance the development of the Pacific Basin community.\"Before her, few scholars did statistical analysis on how Russia's households were financially affected in the transition and suffered poverty,\" said Toshio Watanabe, chancellor of Takushoku University in Tokyo and a judge for the prize. \"Her work was quite an achievement. I wish there were more young scholars like her.\"\nTakeda's interest in Russia had been sparked as an undergraduate by the memoirs of Anna Larina, wife of revolutionary Nikolai Bukharin, who was executed under former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1938. Larina was separated from her one-year-old son and spent two decades in prison camps and in exile.\"I was deeply touched by her life, which was overwhelmed by circumstances and at the mercy of events that she could not resist,\" Takeda said.As a new era of turmoil overtook Russia in the 1990s, Takeda wondered how Russians were coping with unemployment in the post-Soviet economic meltdown.\"I got hooked on the topic from that simple question,\" said Takeda, a research fellow at Waseda University in Tokyo. \"In economics, as in other fields, we're attracted to the issues of the time we live in.\"When she enrolled at graduate school in 1997, her knowledge of Russian \"was non-existent,\" she said. She had chosen French as her foreign language as an undergraduate. To catch up with her classes, she spent a fortnight in the library beginning to teach herself Russian grammar from books.Poverty analysis is a relatively recent field of study in Russia because Soviet-era propaganda claimed it did not exist. After the Soviet Union's demise in 1991, the country's wealth gap expanded rapidly as oligarchs profited from the nation's natural resources, while many pensioners and unemployed saw their assets vanish with the currency's collapse.As the Russian government began to publish more economic statistics, including data on household spending and finances, Takeda's research intensified. In 2001, she moved to Moscow to better learn the language and deepen her postgraduate studies."

        "webpage": "Cover Story : Sharing the Debt Burden\nDan Keeler\nAfrica's New Wave Of Hope\nSharing the Debt Burden\nMany countries in Southern Africa have long been lobbying for the cancellation of their foreign debts. During a recent Southern African Development Community summit in Windhoek, Namibia, retired President of Mozambique and chairman of COMESA Joachim Chissano said he feared the group's economic hopes would remain unrealized as long as the crippling foreign debt was not canceled. Chissano cited such countries as Tanzania, Angola, Malawi and his own country as among those struggling under the heavy burden of foreign debt. He found support in departing President of Namibia San Nujoma, who also strongly believes Africa's debts need to be wiped out.\nSome world leaders, such as Britain's finance minister, Gordon Brown, are known to be sympathetic to the idea of canceling debt in order to encourage development. As part of Britain's initiative to help poor African nations, the country has already agreed to assist Tanzania with its external debt repayments.\nBut a world bank official speaking in Botswana recently said that it was the responsibility of Southern African countries to settle their debts and that \"crying foul\" would not help them. \"Donors are not keen to throw good money after bad,\" he said.\nSouthern Africa contends that its massive debt burden is the reason for the high unemployment in the region and the decline of the manufacturing sector. This vicious circle has made it difficult for most of the countries in the region to manage their loan obligations. But some critics feel Africa's debt crisis has more to do with its own inefficiency, asserting that poor planning, over-borrowing and corruption have all contributed to the crisis. Added to that, insufficient regional cooperation in the area of trade has resulted in over-dependency on foreign capital, while trade barriers have hindered the growth of intra-regional trade.\nAll of these are problems that could be solved with care, time and appropriate assistance, though. Perhaps as the global community becomes more aware of Southern Africa's problems - and more conscious of the opportunities it offers - there is finally a chance of some progress.\nDan Keeler and Alfred Sayila\nAlfred Sayila is a business communications consultant and freelance journalist based in Lusaka, Zambia.\nThis article appeared in issue February 2005"

RUGABERThe Associated Press | September 27,2013\nAP PHOTO Americorps volunteer John Harris III, who is helping to coordinate a jobs fair program, organizes documents for job seekers in Washington. The Labor Department reported on the number of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits on Thursday.\nWASHINGTON \ufffd The job market is sending signs that it may be strengthening.The number of people seeking unemployment benefits has sunk to its lowest point in six years because few companies are laying anyone off anymore. A survey of service companies found that they added jobs last month at their fastest pace in six months.And more small businesses say they plan to hire than at any point since the recession began. All of which is prompting some economists to forecast a healthier job gain in September than the economy has produced in recent months.\ufffdIf you put all that together, it suggests that there has been an improvement in job market conditions,\ufffd said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics. Ashworth predicts that employers will have added 220,000 jobs in September. That would be the biggest gain in nearly seven months and would mark a sharp reversal from the summer. Job growth has averaged just 155,000 a month since April, down from 205,000 in the first four months of the year.The unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August from 7.4 percent in July. But the drop mostly occurred because more Americans stopped working or looking for jobs. The government no longer counts people without a job as unemployed once they stop looking for one.The Federal Reserve is monitoring the jobs data as it considers when to slow its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases. Those purchases are intended to keep interest rates low and speed borrowing, spending and economic growth. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke noted last week that the job market is \ufffdstill far from what all of us would like to see.\ufffdYet it might already be improving.Last week, applications for unemployment benefits fell 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 305,000. The number had reached 294,000 two weeks earlier, but that figure was distorted by computer upgrades in California and Nevada that prevented those states from processing all their claims. Those two states have now caught up and are reporting complete data, the government says. Excluding the distorted figure, last week\ufffds 305,000 applications were the fewest since September 2007, three months before the Great Recession began.Applications generally reflect the pace of layoffs. Layoffs had already fallen in July to the lowest on records dating back to 2000, according to a separate report. Applications have dropped an additional 7 percent since then.The dwindling number of people seeking unemployment benefits \ufffdis signaling further acceleration in payroll gains,\ufffd Jim O\ufffdSullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients. Separately, the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said this month that service companies stepped up hiring last month. Service companies employ 90 percent of the U.S. workforce and range from the retail and construction industries to health care and financial services.Manufacturers also added jobs in August, the institute found, though at a slower pace than in July.In addition, the National Federation of Independent Business has said the percentage of small businesses that plan to add workers rose this month to the highest level since January 2007. The economy is growing steadily, though sluggishly. It expanded at a 2.5 percent annual pace from April to June, the government has estimated. That is up from a scant 1.1 percent annual rate from January through March. For the first six months of the year, the economy has grown at a rate of just 1.8 percent. Economists worry that growth is slowing to an annual rate of 2 percent or less in the current July-September quarter. If correct, that would mark the third quarter in the past four that the annual growth rate has fallen to 2 percent or below, an abnormally low level.About 3.9 million Americans received unemployment benefits in the week that ended Sept. 7, about 23,000 more than in the previous week. That total has fallen 32 percent in the past year. Some recipients likely found jobs, but many have used up all the unemployment benefits available to them."

One place in Ireland where\nexpats can be found in sizable numbers.\n\"There is no such thing as bad publicity\" goes the old saying. Well, I'm not sure that holds true for Ireland this week following the publication of HSBC's \"Expat Explorer Survey\" for 2013.This marks the first time Ireland has featured in the \"Expat Explorer Survey,\" now in its seventh year. The views of those expatriates living in Ireland who took part in the HSBC survey must be sending a nervous shudder up the spines of those whose job it is to entice overseas investment to Ireland.\nLet's face it: Ireland has done remarkably well attracting FDI (foreign direct investment). Most of that investment comes from America, of course, but HSBC surveyed expatriates from all over the world, living all over the world.This highlights the greatest issue with this report: HSBC doesn't tell us how they selected the respondents to their survey. How did they find them? How was the survey administered? Are those who took part representative of the expat community that lives in Ireland? How do the views of those who took part in the survey match those of the American business executives whose views would be pretty important to Ireland?We simply don't know, which makes the survey less useful, but still it cannot be ignored. The Washington Post featured it on the World Views section of their web site. It will probably be picked up elsewhere. And the HSBC imprimatur may not mean much to you, but it may well mean a lot to those executives who are weighing up where to locate their European base.So what did the report say about Ireland?Well, nothing good. HSBC broke down the findings into four categories: Expat Economics, Expat Experience, Raising Children Abroad and Expat Expenses. Which ones did Ireland do well in? None.The first category measured the expats' satisfaction with their earnings and the economy of the host country. Ireland finished 36th out of 37. Only Italy fared worse. Maybe this is to be expected given what has happened to the Irish economy lately, but if this is true then these are not the sort of expats who I would have expected to answer a HSBC survey.I don't know why HSBC separated out expenses from earnings for the measure of Expat Economics, but Ireland finished 37th out of 37 on this list. Italy jumped up to 34th so we can say with certainty that in terms of standard of living for expats, the HSBC puts Ireland firmly in the bottom: below every other EU country surveyed, below America, Canada and Australia, below Taiwan and Brazil. Heck, Egypt, South Africa, Vietnam and Indonesia were all well above Ireland.Obviously life for the average person in Egypt, Vietnam and Indonesia is much tougher than for the average person in Ireland. These are the expats' experiences. Still are the expats in Ireland that much different than those in Indonesia? If not, why do they rate Ireland so badly?Those were the money categories. What about the Expat Experiences and Raising Children Abroad, the so-called \"quality of life\" factors?Again, the results are abysmal. Childcare is expensive and overall, expat parents see Ireland as pretty poor for children in terms of education, health and experience. There were only 24 countries in the 'raising children' comparison. Ireland was 23rd, above Qatar, but below Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Mexico.Then there's Expat Experience: quality of life, ease of setting up and integrating into the local culture. This was where Ireland fared best. Well, least badly. Ireland was ranked 30th of the 37 countries. However, of the seven states listed below Ireland only one could be called \"western\" - the Netherlands. The others are Indonesia, Vietnam, Kuwait, Oman, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.Again, it doesn't seem a scientifically credible survey, but that may not matter. HSBC is a trusted source for many and the Washington Post for many more. With this sort of thing reality matters far less than perception and the perception is Ireland's not that great a place to live.That's the sort of perception that absolutely cannot be allowed to take root in the boardrooms of corporate America, particularly in the IT and biotech firms that the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) has been successfully targeting for many years. It wouldn't be a bad idea for the IDA to begin working on a counter strategy.The IDA is probably longing for last six years when Ireland was simply ignored by HSBC. Then it was a case of 'no news is good news.' Submit MostPopular"

I am very pleased to be here today. I would like to thank the Mutual Funds Directors Forum for inviting me to speak and provide an opportunity to discuss a topic  -  mutual funds investments in derivatives  -  that is very much in the news today and our minds as examiners.\nBefore I go further, I must give the standard SEC disclaimer:\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission disclaims responsibility for any private publication or statement of any SEC employee or Commissioner. This presentation expresses the author's views and does not necessarily reflect those of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.\nAs you are working your way through the agenda of this program, which is focused on mutual funds use of derivatives, you are learning that the scope of what constitutes a derivative instrument is broad and that derivatives range from the rather mundane convertible bond to the very complex, structured product known as a collateralized debt obligation and, of course, many things in-between. Just as the range of derivative instruments is broad so are the risks assumed by investors in these instruments. There are market, liquidity, leverage, counterparty, valuation, legal and structure risk to name only a few.\nAs fund directors you are responsible generally for overseeing your fund's investments to make sure that the risks assumed by the fund are consistent with the risk disclosures the fund has made to its shareholders.1 In addition, you are specifically responsible for establishing fair value procedures the fund is to use in pricing its derivative (and other) positions for which there are no readily available market quotations.2 You are also responsible for approving codes of ethics of both the fund and its investment adviser to ensure that the ethical principals established are appropriate in light of the environment in which the fund and adviser operate.3 Finally, you are responsible for determining that all of the fund's compliance policies and procedures and those of its service providers are reasonably designed to prevent violations of the securities laws.4\nIn my time with you today, I want to talk about certain aspects of a fund's involvement with derivative instruments that fund directors should pay particular attention to. The way I want to approach this presentation is to assume that I was a director of a fund investing in derivatives and then identify those areas of risk that I as a fund director would most want to focus on. In the text below, I focus on 12 areas of risk that I think are most important. Within each of these areas, I start by stating a question I would ask and then include a few related thoughts and comments designed to highlight specific activities, risks and compliance tests that I think are important. (Note that while the discussion below is framed in the context of a fund investing in derivatives, these same questions appear to be relevant as regards risks in most funds). As an actual fund director, I would expect to obtain answers to these questions from various of the fund's service providers, its CCO and legal counsel and then based on those answers, determine if the fund's exposure to the risks associated with its investments in derivatives is appropriate in light of fund shareholder's expectations.\nIMPORTANT AREAS OF RISK\nDoes the fund's adviser have the intellectual and financial resources to be a knowledgeable, nimble participant in the derivatives in which the fund invests?\nHow do the group's resources and abilities compare to those of the counterparties the fund will encounter in the marketplace?\nCan the fund's adviser access and analyze all relevant information to be able to fully understand the probable risks and returns associated with a position; in particular, I as a director would be interested in the following:\nThe specific derivative instruments in which the fund will be investing, the way in which each instrument will be used in achieving the fund's investment objectives and the significant risks associated with each instrument;\nThe information needed to make informed investment decisions and the sources of such information;\nThe means by which sources of information will be compensated;\nHow and by whom will that information be used;\nContingency plans to obtain information if the primary sources become unavailable;\nDoes the fund's adviser have the necessary human and technological resources to make informed investment decisions and implement those decisions on the best possible terms and conditions;\nDoes the fund's adviser have the depth of knowledge and experience regarding each investment strategy employing derivatives so as to be able to effectively oversee and supervise the primary decision-makers and form the basis for backup and continuity of investment decision-making.\nDo we investigate before we leap into an investment?"

        "webpage": "What's Next Is the Bank of Japan done? By Charles Riley @CRrileyCNN New Bank of Japan boss Haruhiko Kuroda has launched an ambitious campaign to end deflation and generate growth. Japan is in the midst of a high-wire act: It is trying to reawaken its economy while not sparking a currency war. The country is trying to beat 15 years of deflation -- falling prices that have a chilling effect on economic growth because consumers hold back on spending in the belief that prices will fall. So the Bank of Japan, led by new Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, is injecting money into the economy on a massive scale. Earlier this month, the BoJ said it would start purchasing longer-term debt and securities like ETFs at an annual pace of 60 to 70 trillion yen. The more assets the bank buys, the more yen it pushes out. The point is to drive up annual inflation to a target of 2%. But the actions have also contributed to a sharp decline in the yen's value. And that's the rub. A weaker yen is good news for Japan's exporters, which will see increased demand for their products and more selling opportunities abroad as the yen swoons. But a sustained drop in the currency's value also raises the prospect of tit-for-tat retaliatory actions by other countries. The yen has declined 27% in the past six months, falling to 100 against the U.S. dollar in recent days. Related story: Bank of Japan takes fight to deflation Kuroda insists he is not trying to hurt other countries and has gone on a diplomatic offensive to reassure Japan's trading partners that he is not engaged in currency warfare. \"Our policies are taken for domestic purposes and currencies are absolutely not our target,\" Kuroda told Japan-based media last week. \"It's unthinkable that we will change monetary policy just because currencies move in a certain way.\" In the eyes of some, he has a hard sell. \"Japan is likely to be labeled as a currency warrior by major Asian trading partners,\" Steven Englander, a currency analyst at Citi, wrote last week. South Korea and China, two of Japan's key trading partners, are among the most likely to complain. At the same time, the BoJ has found support from the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has carried out an aggressive bond-buying program of its own in recent years. Janet Yellen, the bank's vice chairman, said recently that Japan's actions are \"in their own best interest.\" \"It's something that, if successful, will be good for stimulating growth in the global economy and will be good for us too,\" she said. And the IMF's Christine Lagarde said last week that the BoJ's actions are \"another welcome step\" in efforts to loosen monetary policy and spur growth in economies around the world. Related story: Don't fight the BoJ \"Such comments are important because they give international political cover to the BoJ policy framework, and remove the fear that the BoJ will be forced to change course by international political criticism,\" Englander said. Yet Japan's major trading partners are clearly paying attention. The U.S. Treasury Department last week struck a more cautionary tone in its semi-annual report on currency practices. \"We will continue to press Japan to adhere to the commitments agreed to in the G7 and G20, to remain oriented towards meeting respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments and to refrain from competitive devaluation and targeting its exchange rate for competitive purposes,\" the report said. For now, Kuroda appears to be signaling that the BoJ will take a wait-and-see approach before considering further action. \"Our belief is that we took all necessary steps to achieve the 2% inflation target basically in two years,\" he said last week. \"We'll examine the effect each month but that doesn't mean we will adjust policy every month.\" So far, both Kuroda and Abe have balked at the prospect of buying foreign currency bonds -- a move which would almost certainly bring a response from other nations. Japan will get to make its case later this week at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. The argument will probably sound much like a line Kuroda tried out this week: \"If Japan's economy recovers steadily and price stability is achieved as a result, that benefits not just Japan but the global economy, including our neighbors,\" he said in Tokyo.

        "webpage": "Back to November 2012 home page\nFree & Clear: November 2012\nTime to pay down the uncertainty principalBy John Hood\nAs I write this, I don't know who is going to win the presidential or gubernatorial elections. But one thing is for sure  -  the winners better fix the political uncertainty plaguing government before it wrecks the economy again.\nNot everyone thinks the issue is important. Some politicians and pundits have dismissed recent concerns about policy uncertainty as nothing more than Republican partisans attacking the Obama administration's tax, regulatory and health-care policies. They are mistaken. It's more than a talking point, and it didn't start with the election of Barack Obama.\nThe movement away from the predictable began under George W. Bush. In response to the \"dot-bomb\" recession it inherited from the Clinton years, the Bush team proposed one-time tax rebates followed later by tax-rate reductions with expiration dates some thought would be enforced. Others weren't so sure. Neither enabled long-term planning by households and businesses. The Federal Reserve System contributed by keeping interest rates artificially low from 2002 to 2005, which helped inflate the housing bubble. When it popped, the Bush administration and the Fed turned uncertainty into chaos by bailing out some financial institutions and letting others fail.\nAll this happened before Obama took office in 2009. Unfortunately, his agenda introduced more uncertainty. His stimulus package was hastily constructed and aimed entirely at manipulating consumption in the short run instead of incentivizing investment for the long run. The Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory bill he signed into law in 2010 created new rules and bureaucracies with unknown costs and unpredictable effects on finance, insurance and other industries. Obama's health-care legislation, rammed through Congress without popular support, set up a series of complicated decisions for families and businesses. Those decisions had to be made without knowing which parts of the legislation would survive judicial review, which parts would be implemented by states and which parts would prove impractical to enforce by the scheduled deadline of 2014.\nMy health insurer, Des Moines, Iowa-based Principal Financial Group Inc., gave up trying to figure this out and exited the business in late 2010. (So much for the promise that if I liked my health plan I'd get to keep it.) Many companies continue to run the numbers on the \"pay or play\" aspect of Obamacare  -  whether to purchase expensive, Washington-approved health plans for their employees or to bail out, pay a fine and let their employees acquire insurance through new state-purchasing pools.\nThere are good reasons to believe that uncertainty slows economic growth. Friedrich Hayek, Robert Lucas and Edward Prescott won their Nobel Prizes in economics in part for their work exploring the relationship between discretionary policymaking and economic performance. The title of one of Prescott's most famous papers, co-written with Finn Kydland, says it all  -  Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans. Even good policy doesn't work if people doubt it will stick.\nThere are also good reasons to believe that uncertainty is increasing. Scott Baker and Nicholas Bloom at Stanford University and Steven Davis at the University of Chicago have constructed an Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for the past three decades. It includes variables such as the number and magnitude of tax policies set to expire, variation in economic projections and the extent of media coverage of policy disputes. Their work generated two major findings. First, uncertainty about economic policy has been about twice as high since 2008 as it was for the 23 years before then. Second, uncertainty is strongly and inversely correlated with economic growth. The more people are unsure about what's going to happen next, the less risk they take. That translates into fewer investments made and jobs created. Two economists writing for the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland followed up by comparing the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index with small-business behavior from 1986 to 2011. Even after adjusting for factors such as consumer confidence and the business cycle, they discovered that increased uncertainty led to decreased willingness to hire new workers.\nWhoever is elected president or governor should take the problem of uncertainty seriously. They need to fashion simple, understandable initiatives with some bipartisan support and buy-in from the general public rather than adopt stopgap measures or push big ideas through on party-line votes. For example, they could ask companies and households to give up cherished tax breaks and subsidies in exchange for permanent reductions in tax rates and government budgets. Whatever they decide, they had better make it concrete. Otherwise, the only sure thing will be more economic paralysis."

        "webpage": "Strong local units good for bank reform\nBy Peter Thal Larsen November 2, 2009\nTags: banking | Deutsche Bank | HSBC. | Josef Ackermann | regulation | Santander The debate about reforming the financial system is often presented as an argument between regulators on one side and banks on the other. But it is also beginning to throw up some differences among banks. One such rift has been exposed by the suggestion that banks should be forced to hold greater reserves of liquidity and capital in national subsidiaries.\nRegulators see this as a way of dealing with the future failure of a big bank. Rather than relying on the bank's home government to pick up the tab  -  something it may not be able or willing to do  -  each country where the institution operates could take responsibility for its local subsidiary.\nJosef Ackermann, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, is concerned that this approach will lead to the fragmentation of the financial system. On Monday, he warned a conference organised by the Financial Services Authority of Britain that it would make markets less efficient and lead to lower economic growth.\nHowever, the chief executive of Abbey, the subsidiary of Spanish giant Santander, told the same conference that his bank already operates along the lines envisaged by regulators: its British, Brazilian, Mexican and Portuguese subsidiaries are all separately capitalised.\nAnt\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio acknowledged this might be less efficient, but said the structure creates a \"firewall\" that limits contagion if one part of the bank were to run into trouble. HSBC is organised in a similar way.\nIndeed, such an approach may even support globalisation. According to Adair Turner, the FSA's chairman, integrated global banks were quickest to withdraw liquidity from emerging markets when the crisis struck. Those with local subsidiaries stayed put.\nTrue, a federal structure may be better suited to retail banks, which are more likely to have matching assets and liabilities in the same country. Investment banks are less easy to carve up.\nOne of their main functions is to match buyers and sellers of risk around the world. This would be harder to do efficiently if, say, each derivatives trade had to be booked in a local subsidiary. It would also make it more difficult for banks to manage their overall exposure.\nNevertheless, Santander's approach shows that what regulators are proposing is not impossible. Ackermann may be right that a system of local subsidiaries is less efficient. But he should also recognise that globally integrated banks are inherently more risky.\nTaxpayers are rightly suspicious of underwriting banks' global ambitions. Short of breaking up big banks, a federal structure may be the best compromise on offer.\nHK inside-trade payout more deterrent than portent Next Post \"\nUruguay's weed spoils could get even higher No comments so far\nPeter is Asia Editor of Reuters Breakingviews, based in Hong Kong.

Sweeney (D-West Deptford) had proposed to accomplish those goals through a constitutional amendment  -  which would evade the looming veto pen of Gov. Chris Christie, but face even more intense opposition from the state's business associations  -  he recently agreed to support the Assembly-approved measure that will be considered in the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee today.Kathleen A. Davis, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey, said the legislative provision to automatically increase the minimum wage every year according to inflation is \"still very troublesome to us,\" though she said \"having the opportunity to have our thoughts and concerns weighed is certainly a better way to go than a 'yes or no' question going to voters to make this issue part of our constitution.\"\"This is a very complex and far-reaching issue, so I think that going through the legislative process provides more opportunities for input from the business community in terms of what this increase will mean to them, especially to small businesses,\" Davis said.Davis said a January 2012 survey of the chamber's members found the top reason why businesses oppose the measure is the impact it would have on consumer prices, as any increase in labor costs would get passed on to customers and make a company's products and services less competitive.Some business groups have noted that the shore's tourism industry was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy, and argue the minimum wage increase would amount do a double blow, but Samia Bahsoun, a steering committee member at the small business group Main Street Alliance, made the opposite point, saying the extra income in low-wage workers' pockets would translate into new spending and help the economy.\"So the ripple effect of just this additional dollar... would tremendously impact small biz, and we know that we all need it here on the Jersey Shore,\" she said.According to the New Jersey Time to Care Coalition, which supports the bill sponsored by Assembly Speaker Sheila Y. Oliver (D-East Orange) and other Assembly members, if the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would currently be more than $10 an hour, compared to the $7.25 an hour rate it is today.Oliver said lawmakers are capable of helping businesses and low-wage workers at the same time.\"We are going to be there for those business owners,\" she said. \"We are going to be promulgating a variety of initiatives to help support them, and I do not believe that in order to support businesses that have been ravaged by Sandy it means that we cannot elevate the minimum wage for low income workers in this state.\"Oliver challenged her fellow legislators to pass the bill, noting that the state has in recent years provided numerous incentives to businesses and arguing \"it is time to turn attention to the people that make business prosperous, and it is the people that work within those businesses.\"To voice its concerns to the Legislature, the chamber has joined a coalition of 11 state business groups led by the New Jersey Business & Industry Association to testify against the bill at today's Senate committee hearing.In her prepared testimony, Stefanie Riehl, NJBIA assistant vice president, said the coalition is especially concerned about the proposed minimum wage increase after witnessing Hurricane Sandy's impact on businesses, and hearing that \"many of our employers are still focusing on making payroll and how they can make their workers whole following the losses they've incurred.\"\"Thousands of employers have a long and difficult task in rebuilding their businesses and getting people back to work. Just getting back to where they were is going to be hard enough,\" Riehl said in a statement Friday. \"Lawmakers shouldn't raise the bar even higher.\"Contributing: Jared Kaltwasser"

        "webpage": "Senate moves to curb ratings agency conflicts\nBy Ben Rooney, staff reporterMay 13, 2010: 7:37 PM ETNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The U.S. Senate approved two amendments to the sweeping financial reform bill Thursday that seek to curb conflicts of interest between ratings agencies and Wall Street banks. The goal of one of the proposals, called the \"Restore Integrity To Credit Ratings\" amendment, is to prevent the securities industry from shopping around among credit rating agencies for a security's initial rating. Facebook\nComment on this storyUnder that amendment, the Securities and Exchange Commission would appoint a panel to develop a system that would independently match ratings agencies with firms that have securities that need to be rated. The board would largely be made up of investors. But it would also include representatives from the securities industry and the ratings agencies, as well as one independent member. \"Today is a major victory for Main Streets all over America,\" said Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., who authored the amendment. \"We're cleaning up Wall Street's dishonest system and replacing it with one that rewards accuracy instead of fraud.\"The nation's main ratings agencies -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch -- have come under fire recently for contributing to the financial crisis of 2008-2009 by assigning top-tier ratings to securities that later proved to be toxic, such as bonds backed by sub-prime mortgages. Last month, a Congressional panel released a slew of internal e-mails from the leading credit rating agencies that showed employees at those firms knew of the dangers in subprime mortgages, but gave securities backed by them the seal of approval anyway.At the same time, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has opened an investigation into some top financial firms to determine whether they misled credit rating agencies to obtain better ratings. However, Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., who is leading the effort to overhaul the nation's financial regulatory framework, voted against Franken's amendment.\"I like what Al was offering on this,\" Dodd told reporters in Washington. \"Except that I just didn't know the outcome of it.\"He described the proposal as \"a sort-of wheel of fortune,\" and said he was \"uneasy\" about how it would work.Separately, the Senate approved an amendment that would \"remove the government seal of approval from investment ratings agencies\" by eliminating legal protections for them, according to the amendment's authors. The aim is to end the \"over-dependence\" on ratings agencies as the financial industry's main risk auditor. That proposal is similar to one the House included in the Wall Street reform bill passed late last year. \"An investment rating should mean something, but today it doesn't,\" said Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla., who authored the amendment. \"Removing their federal endorsement will end the dangerous over-reliance on these ratings and allow sound measures of risk to re-emerge in the marketplace -- giving investors confidence an investment's true risk is known.\"Dodd said he is concerned that LeMieux's amendment may have \"undercut entirely\" the need for Franken's proposal.\"I'm not even sure the Franken amendment exists any longer in light of the LeMieux amendment,\" said Dodd. \"It basically did away with all this.\"-- CNNMoney.com senior writer Jennifer Liberto contributed to this report.

The System consists of a seven member Board of Governors with headquarters in Washington, D.C., and twelve Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the United States.\nAppointments to the Board\nThe seven members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to serve 14-year terms of office. Members may serve only one full term, but a member who has been appointed to complete an unexpired term may be reappointed to a full term. The President designates, and the Senate confirms, two members of the Board to be Chairman and Vice Chairman, for four-year terms.\nOnly one member of the Board may be selected from any one of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts. In making appointments, the President is directed by law to select a \"fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country.\" These aspects of selection are intended to ensure representation of regional interests and the interests of various sectors of the public.\nThe primary responsibility of the Board members is the formulation of monetary policy. The seven Board members constitute a majority of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the group that makes the key decisions affecting the cost and availability of money and credit in the economy. The other five members of the FOMC are Reserve Bank presidents, one of whom is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The other Bank presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. By statute the FOMC determines its own organization, and by tradition it elects the Chairman of the Board of Governors as its Chairman and the President of the New York Bank as its Vice Chairman.\nThe Board sets reserve requirements and shares the responsibility with the Reserve Banks for discount rate policy. These two functions plus open market operations constitute the monetary policy tools of the Federal Reserve System.\nIn addition to monetary policy responsibilities, the Federal Reserve Board has regulatory and supervisory responsibilities over banks that are members of the System, bank holding companies, international banking facilities in the United States, Edge Act and agreement corporations, foreign activities of member banks, and the U.S. activities of foreign-owned banks. The Board also sets margin requirements, which limit the use of credit for purchasing or carrying securities.\nIn addition, the Board plays a key role in assuring the smooth functioning and continued development of the nation's vast payments system [see Fedwire and Payment System Risk Policy].\nAnother area of Board responsibility is the development and administration of regulations that implement major federal laws governing consumer credit such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Truth in Savings Act [see Consumer Information and Community Development].\nThe Board usually meets several times a week. Meetings are conducted in compliance with the Government in the Sunshine Act, and many meetings are open to the public. If the Board has convened to consider confidential financial information, however, the sessions are closed to public observation.\nContacts within Government\nAs they carry out their duties, members of the Board routinely confer with officials of other government agencies, representatives of banking industry groups, officials of the central banks of other countries, members of Congress and academicians. For example, they meet frequently with Treasury officials and the Council of Economic Advisers to help evaluate the economic climate and to discuss objectives for the nation's economy. Governors also discuss the international monetary system with central bankers of other countries and are in close contact with the heads of the U.S. agencies that make foreign loans and conduct foreign financial transactions.\nThe Structure of the Federal Reserve\nHome | About the Fed Accessibility | Contact Us"

(John Woods / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\nJulian Beltrame, The Canadian Press\nPublished Wednesday, July 23, 2014 7:17AM EDT\nLast Updated Wednesday, July 23, 2014 12:57PM EDT\nOTTAWA -- Finance Minister Joe Oliver is rejecting a recommendation from a report issued by the C.D. Howe Institute that he focus more on creating jobs than eliminating a tiny deficit.\nThe report by McMaster University economics professor William Scarth argues that keeping the deficit at 0.5 per cent of GDP for the next three years could lower the unemployment rate by 0.4 per cent, or create the equivalent of 75,000 additional jobs.\nThe recent slowdown in economic growth and job creation has put the government under increased pressure to become more active on stimulating growth. Earlier this month the Ontario government announced a budget that would spend more on infrastructure while running a $12.5-billion deficit.\nIn a statement, Oliver said job creation can be accomplished without creating deficits during times of economic recovery.\n\"Our government will not open the taps on reckless spending. We will not go down that well-trod and irresponsible path to economic decline,\" he said.\nIn a commentary earlier in the week, Liberal deputy leader Ralph Goodale said the Harper government was in \"denial\" about the jobs picture in Canada all so it \"can concoct a surplus on the eve of an election.\"\nEliminating the deficit in 2015 is critical for the federal Conservatives heading into a fall election that year because in 2011 Harper promised to cut personal taxes by about $2.5 billion through a form of income splitting once the budget was balanced.\nThe report argues that maintaining a deficit in the $10 billion range, where most believe it currently stands, would pose no economic or fiscal problems for Ottawa, which already has by far the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7.\nLonger term, it would mean missing the stated target of reducing national debt-to-GDP to 25 per cent by 2021 by a single percentage point.\n\"A government that emphasizes its commitment to protect the interests of working Canadians should not reject this opportunity to lower unemployment when it can be achieved without a serious trade-off,\" Scarth states.\nThe recommendation that Ottawa should delay its efforts to balance the budget and spend on infrastructure to create jobs has been advocated by left-wing economists, but Scarth's report is not so easily pigeon-holed.\nScarth is critical of the Ontario Liberal's recent budget given the province's burdensome debt and on efficiency grounds\nThe paper argues that sub-national governments like provinces don't have the same ability to stimulate the economy through spending, partly because of spillage to other provinces and partly because their actions don't directly impact the country's terms of trade.\nC.D. Howe economist Finn Poschmann says that is why stimulus spending in countries like Greece, which have no control over the value of the euro, tend not to work, or not work optimally.\nFormer Bank of Canada governor David Dodge also recently came out in favour of increased spending on infrastructure, particularly at this point in the business cycle when borrowing costs are at historically low levels.\n\"It is thus important to realize that in the current environment of low long-term interest rates, fiscal prudence does not require bringing the annual budget balance to zero almost immediately,\" he wrote in a paper for the Bennett Jones law firm.\nThe report estimates a 1.5 per cent multiplier effect from carrying a $10-billion deficit -- in essence spending $10 billion more than planned so that the economy will enlarge by about $15 billion.\nBank of Montreal chief economist Doug Porter says he might not advise a new round of stimulus spending as long as the economy is \"plodding\" along, but it also would not concern him.\n\"The market is not crying out for a tighter fiscal policy at the federal level,\" he explained. \"If the government wheeled out a significant medium-term infrastructure program, I don't think I'd have a big problem with it -- they can borrow very cheaply and there's a pretty good case to be made that there's lots of demand for infrastructure.\"\nScarth's paper argues that while infrastructure spending would help the economy, it is important that it come from Ottawa rather than Queen's Park or other provincial capitals. It would be more effective and Ottawa, with its low debt-to-GDP ratio, can afford it, he said.\nCanadian manufacturing poised for true recovery: KPMG\nCanadians at odds with Harper's key policies: focus-group report BoC downgrades economy, holds 1% interest rate steady\nMore news from Business\nAnother Portugal bank needs help, this time for $5.7 billion\nTim Hortons names new president for 2nd time since 2014 acquisition\nBNN VIDEOS _\nMoneyTalk: Protecting children online\nMoneyTalk: Investment opportunities in the cloud space\nMoneyTalk: Understanding cloud computing\nMoney Talk for Wednesday, August 24, 2016"

The bank has $1.5 billion set aside, though it believes the costs may significantly exceed that amount.HSBC is one of several banks, including Citigroup and Standard Chartered, being investigated by the government for allegedly allowing millions of dollars from drug traffickers, terrorists or countries under sanctions to illegally move through the U.S. financial system. While some of these investigations have been in the works for years, banking attorneys say the level of scrutiny coming from the government has intensified. Some suspect regulators are reacting to congressional criticism that they have been slow to act. Others say government interest in money laundering never wavered, but that resources were redirected to address the financial crisis. Either way, there is a clear difference between the anti-money-laundering enforcement of today and five years ago, said Michael Dawson, managing director of Promontory Financial Group, a financial consulting firm.\"The involvement of the Department of Justice in sanctions and enforcement actions is much greater now than it was five years ago,\" he said. \"And the size of the fines have increased by a factor of 10 or more.\"Financial firms have in the past primarily dealt with their direct regulators on managing money-laundering controls. But in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Justice has launched more criminal cases under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), a law requiring financial institutions and their employees to combat money laundering. Attempts to contact officials at the agency were not successful.Justice exacted its biggest fine under the law in 2010, when Wachovia agreed to pay $110 million for failing to stop millions of dollars of Colombian and Mexican drug money from being laundered through accounts at the bank.\"There has been a bit of a criminalization of regulatory violations,\" said Ellen Zimiles, head of the Global Investigations and Compliance practice at Navigant. \"It's not as if the statutes do not allow criminal cases, but the practice of bringing criminal actions for BSA violations ... has been limited to extreme cases.\"\nHSBC is facing criminal and civil charges. The bank's troubles came to a head earlier this year when the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations released a report accusing the bank of helping clients with drug trafficking and terrorist ties to bring money into the United States.\"We deeply regret what took place in the United States and Mexico,\" Stuart T. Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC, told reporters on a conference call Monday. \"A number of people have left the bank and have had clawbacks against their compensation.\"Months following the HSBC report, another London-based bank, Standard Chartered, was ensnared in a money-laundering scandal. New York's financial regulator accused the bank of flouting sanctions and scheming with the Iranian government to launder $250 billion from 2001 to 2007, leaving the United States \"vulnerable to terrorists.\" Federal regulators are also investigating Standard Chartered's activities.\"The multiplicity of agencies involved in these cases is staggering,\" said Andrew L. Sandler, chairman of the law firm Buckley Sandler. \"It is much more complicated to negotiate resolutions with agencies who sometimes have conflicting, or at least inconsistent, points of views.\"Sandler said the pile-on of agencies tends to create pressure for penalties to be higher than normal. \"It's enforcement dollar inflation,\" he said. \"Once numbers start going up, all of the agencies' expectations of numbers start going up.\"Consider penalties at Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which has hit 11 companies accused of money laundering or violating sanctions with a total of $623 million in penalties through October. That compares with $91 mllion in penalties handed down to 21 companies in 2011. Treasury officials declined to comment for this article."

        "webpage": "How eMoney Supports DoL Compliance Today\n\nComplying with the latest regulations passed down by the Department of Labor won't be solved by a quick fix. Rather, it requires advisors find innovative solutions throughout all stages of their client relationships. From gathering every bit of a client's financial data to providing advice in their best interest, in a post-DoL world, advisors - and the firms they work for - will need to dedicate more time and effort to almost every aspect of their business.\n\nYet even as the specifics of the rule continue to unfold, our software continues to provide the tools fiduciary-focused advisors need to remain competitive. Here are the top 6 ways eMoney supports DoL Compliance Today.\n\n1. Gathering Client Data\n\nThere's no sense in even attempting to provide advice in a client's best interest without all the facts. You now need to understand each and every client's entire financial picture in order to accurately understand their goals, needs, and risk tolerance. With the only platform that integrates advisor and client account aggregation into an advisor dashboard, eMoney helps advisors streamline the process of creating an accurate picture of every client's financial status. Plus, it all updates automatically.\n\n2. Managing Documents\n\nI think Newton's Third Law of Physics states, \"More regulation means more paperwork,\" or something like that. Either way, it's clear that eMoney's online document Vault will be an integral of any DoL solution. Not only does it make collaborating over documents and reports much more efficient, but it also provides a secure and comprehensive record of each of these interactions that advisors or managers can then recall at any time.\n\n3.

Enter looming budget crisis. And once again, a disconnect between how Washington and Wall Street see the world could cause pain for investors if the two get their signals crossed. At the beginning of next year, $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts - known as the fiscal cliff - will automatically become law unless Congress acts. Such dramatic moves could hammer consumer and business spending, push the U.S. economy back into recession and send markets reeling. However, there is a sense that neither the financiers and investors in New York nor the lawmakers in Congress are taking each other seriously enough. Many in Washington believe Congress could do nothing, and the market reaction would be relatively sanguine. Plenty on Wall Street say the fiscal cliff, one way or another, will be dealt with. It raises the possibility that Congress will sail over the cliff, and markets will freak. \"The markets have been way too sanguine on the fiscal cliff,\" said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist for Potomac Research Group, which tracks Washington for institutional investors. The fiscal cliff's automatic triggers were built into law as a way to force lawmakers to tackle huge U.S. budget deficits. Wall Street banks, investors, and financial industry lobbyists have coalesced around the view that after the elections Congress will reach a short-term deal to avert the worst of the cliff. In short, they believe Congress will kick the can down the road for several more months. \"They'll have to do some sort of short-term extension to buy some time to develop the larger component of addressing the fiscal cliff, which is a large-scale fiscal plan,\" said Ken Bentsen, head of the Washington office for financial industry group SIFMA, who sees that happening. As SIFMA's chief lobbyist, Bentsen is essentially Wall Street's eyes and ears in the nation's capital. He was a congressman himself - a Texas Democrat who served in the House of Representatives from 1995 to 2003. But Wall Street and Washington have misread each other in the past, and it has not been pretty for markets. One of the ugliest examples of that was in September 2008, not two weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed, when the House rejected a $700 billion financial bailout plan. Markets plunged; that shock was enough to galvanize lawmakers to pass a revised plan a few days later. There is some concern that poor assumptions are being made about each side. In Washington, there are Tea Party-backed Republicans who anticipate a market shock but believe the pain is worth it if it changes what they see as a culture of spending in Washington. While none of them are saying this publicly in the pre-election environment, lobbyists in close contact with Capitol Hill say there are enough members with such an outlook to create headaches for leaders like House Speaker John Boehner just as they did during debt ceiling negotiations in 2011. In addition, there is a growing group of Democrats and center-left policy wonks who say that going over the cliff may be a viable tactical option to force revenue increases on Republicans, who have resisted them. The theory is simple: no one has to cast a potentially career-ending vote to raise tax rates, and lawmakers can easily blame the other party for the impasse. The tax rates snap back to pre-2001 levels, to the levels prevailing before the tax cuts brought in by President George W. Bush, and $109 billion in automatic spending cuts start to bite - half military and half domestic programs. Senator Patty Murray, the second-ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee and a top player in last year's debt limit and deficit reduction negotiations, was among the first lawmakers to voice willingness to pursue a previously unthinkable"

        "webpage": "India's PM Tries To Reassure Country Over Rupee's Slide Share Tweet E-mail Comments Print By Julie McCarthy Originally published on Fri August 30, 2013 12:03 pm\nIndian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during a diplomatic signing ceremony with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in New Delhi last week.\nIndia's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressed a steep slide in the country's currency in recent weeks in a rare public speech on Friday, hoping to assuage concern over the rupee's sudden depreciation and blaming the opposition for inaction in Parliament that he said was sending the wrong signals to the markets. \"There is no reason to believe that we are going down the hill,\" said Singh, a veteran economist who has been prime minister for nearly a decade. They were Singh's first remarks since the rupee began tumbling in recent weeks. As he attempted to soothe worries over the economic crisis enveloping Asia's third-largest economy, the rupee staged a mild comeback on Friday, having lost fifteen percent of its value since May. Singh said he believed that the country's currency had slipped below its true value. But he said the depreciation also had an upside. \"To some extent, depreciation can be good for the economy as this will help to increase our export competitiveness and discourage imports,\" he said. Singh said the rupee's slide was due to the expected winding down of the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary stimulus which has pumped cheap money into the wider economy, including emerging markets such as India. Foreign investors have pulled their money out of India in recent weeks in anticipation of the Fed's tapering, which would signal a renewal of the U.S. economy and thus make it a better bet for investors. Singh said Indians need to reduce their $50 billion a year gold-buying habit, which drains foreign reserves and ties up assets in a non-productive holdings. He repeated a mantra of his government, saying, \"We need to reduce our appetite for gold.\" Singh lashed out at the opposition BJP party, which he accused of hurting investor sentiment by repeatedly disrupting the work of Parliament. The 80-year-old prime minster also mildly admonished rich countries, hinting that the U.S. Fed's move should think of its impact on the rest of the world. \"In a more equitable world order, it is only appropriate that the developed countries - in pursuing their fiscal and monetary policies - should take into account the repercussions on the economy of emerging countries,\" he said. Singh  -  who as finance minister was the architect of an overhaul of the Indian economy in the 1990s that helped the country become an international powerhouse  -  emphasized that there was no going back. He said the government was not going to impose controls or reverse its reforms. But some of those reforms are costly. A food security program proposed on Monday would provide huge food subsidies in the form of wheat, rice and coarse grains - some 800 million people would be eligible for the program. Its $20 billion price tag sent markets sharply down over worries of India's rising fiscal deficit. Moody's said that the measure will worsen India's economic imbalance and is a negative development for the country's sovereign rating.Copyright 2013 NPR. To see more, visit .

        "webpage": "Probe Insurers sweat over global warming\nSharon Beder\nCitation: Sharon Beder, 'Insurers Sweat Over Global Warming', Engineers Australia, August 2001, p. 41.\nThis is a final version submitted for publication. Minor editorial changes may have subsequently been made. Sharon Beder's Other Publications\nLast month the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, consisting of hundreds of the worlds top climate scientists, published its latest report. The 2,600-page UN report found that the planet is warming faster than they had previously predicted as a result of industrial pollution and that the human consequences are likely to be catastrophic. The Panel concluded from its detailed and comprehensive analysis of temperature and weather data that the earth is experiencing an unprecedented period of climate instability as a result of warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The insurance industry is all too aware of this climate instability having suffered billions of dollars in losses over the past decade from storms, landslides, flooding and droughts. The costs of 'natural' disasters of this type have been escalating since 1987 causing insurance companies to form coalitions to lobby for government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In July 1996 a large delegation of insurers attended the conference on Climate Change in Geneva and they have been active ever since.\nThe Reinsurance Association of America (RAA) pointed out in 2000 that 50 percent of the insured losses throughout the world over the previous 40 years that were due to natural catastrophes had occurred since 1990. Insurers paid $57 billion for weather-related losses in the first half of the 1990s compared with $17 billion for the whole of the previous decade. In July the Red Cross warned that weather-induced disasters had increased sharply worldwide in the late 1990s, from 200 a year before 1996 to 392 in 2000.\nIn 1998 alone weather-related catastrophes claimed 50,000 lives and cost an estimated $93 billion. Of these losses only $15 billion were insured. Munich Re, one of the world's largest reinsurers (providing insurance for insurance companies), estimates that climate change could cost more than $300 billion dollars a year in decades to come. The problem for insurers is that their rates and coverage policies are based on past trends and averages and historically-based probabilities that are rapidly becoming redundant. Climate change that results from global warming makes their predictions meaningless and poses a serious threat to their future profitability and viability. A few insurers are finding ways to profit from global warming by offering businesses insurance against loss of business that results from climate change. One such firm, Element Re, a provider of \"weather risk management products\" has just done a deal with Atmos Energy Corporation in the US, which is a gas distributor. The policy provided by Element Re, insures Atmos against revenue loss from warmer winter temperatures in cities across the US. However the ability of insurance companies to continue to insure for extreme weather events is much more questionable. Many insurers are now refusing to insure parts of southern Florida, Hawaii and the Carribean. If this trend were to continue then the costs of natural disasters could become a governmental responsibility. However the costs of weather-related incidents are increasing 10% each year, much faster than national GDP and the ability for governments to cover them will diminish over time. The alternative is for the burden to fall on individual victims. This already happens in developing countries, where there is often no compensation for loss of life and property. In its annual World Disasters Report the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said that \"Recurrent disasters from floods in Asia to drought in the Horn of Africa, to windstorms in Latin America, are sweeping away gains and calling into question the possibility of recovery\". The Red Cross noted that \"international aid will not be able to keep up with the impact of global warning\" and that in any case, many aid dollars tend to find their way back to donor countries through fees paid to foreign aid consultants. It suggested that in future \"poor countries might seek legal compensation [from countries causing global warming] to pay for reconstruction through an 'international tort climate court'.\" A report published by the Chartered Insurance Institute (CII) in the UK estimates that, if nothing is done to stop global warming, economic losses from extreme weather will be larger than global GDP by 2065. This puts into perspective the costs of preventing global warming, which amount to only a small percentage of GDP.

The people inside the vault were spared.\nA killer tornado obliterated a Tinker Federal Credit Union branch in Moore, Okla., but its steel safe deposit vault encased in concrete saved the lives of Branch Manager Jan Davis, eight members and 14 employees.\nThat image, of the vault standing sentinel surrounded by debris, was one of the striking images that captured national media coverage after the May 20 storm.\nOnly nine days after the tornado killed 25 people in Moore, injured hundreds of others, destroyed 1,300 homes, two schools and numerous businesses, including the Moore branch, The $3.1 billion credit union's senior management and the board of directors decided to immediately start the process of rebuilding the branch in the same location.\n\"My staff is excited about going back home,\" Davis said in an interview with Credit Union Times. \"I love this community. I can't imagine being somewhere else.\"\nAlthough the vault that saved 22 lives had to be scrapped, a portion of its wall has been saved to create a memorial at the new 6,000-square-foot branch, which will feature a personal finance caf\u00e9, investment center, an indoor children's play area, six drive-through lanes, an ATM, and of course, a new safe deposit vault.\nThe details of the memorial are still being worked out, said Matthew Stratton, TFCU senior vice president of marketing. More than 20 photos of the branch's reconstruction are posted on the credit union's website.\nSome of the people who huddled in the vault during the tornado were interviewed on national news broadcasts such as NBC and CNN. The story also appeared on news sites throughout the country and around the world.\nAs the tornado approached, Davis and employees closed the branch and quickly ushered everyone into the vault. Despite the F-5 tornado's ferocious winds of 261 to 318 mph, Davis and others in the vault managed to keep the door shut.\nNext Page: Three Horrifying Minutes\nFor about three horrifying minutes, Davis, the employees and members were cramped in a safe deposit vault as the monstrous tornado was raging around them, destroying everything in its path.\n\"I was at the door and left it just a crack open so I could tell what was happening,\" she described in May. \"Once I heard the noise of the tornado - the cracks and the pops - I knew it was there and pulled the steel door shut. We heard very loud bangs and crashes, glass breaking, things hitting things. There was no doubt in anybody's mind in that vault that the building was gone.\"\nWhile Tinker FCU's storm protocols went smoothly, the Oklahoma City-based cooperative is considering installing a latch system for its vault doors to keep them closed during a natural disaster.\n\"The vault is designed to keep people out, not accidentally lock people in,\" Stratton said. \"There is probably going to be some type of adaptation to make it easier to latch the vault from the inside but would still allow people to get out.\"\nDavis said the new branch will be one of the first new structures to pop up in the devastated area. Because the branch can be seen from Interstate 35 it will give passersby and visitors a strong sign that the city is on the rebound, she said.\nMoore residents wasted little time cleaning up the hundreds of thousands of tons of debris and rebuilding their homes and businesses.\nThe Oklahoman, a daily newspaper, reported that in Moore the sounds of construction are ubiquitous.\n\"Moore residents say they wake up and often go to sleep with the bang of hammers and the whine of power tools,\" the newspaper reported Nov. 19.\nThe city issued 332 building permits for new, single-family homes in storm-damaged areas and an additional 418 permits for remodel work for homes that were damaged by the tornado, according to The Oklahoman. What's more, 11 businesses have secured permits to rebuild and six other companies have applied for permits to remodel, the newspaper reported.\n\"The residents of Moore are strong and proud, and they are working hard to make a comeback,\" Stratton said.

        "webpage": "The impact of back problems on retirement wealth.\nThis study undertook an economic analysis of the costs of early retirement due to back problems, with the aim of quantifying how much lower the value of accumulated wealth of individuals who exit the workforce early due to back problems is by the time they reach the traditional retirement age of 65 years--compared to those who remained in the workforce. This was done using the output dataset of the microsimulation model Health&WealthMOD. It was found that over 99% of individuals who are employed full time will have accumulated some wealth at age 65 years, whereas as little as 74% of those who are out of the labour force due to back problems will have done so. Those who retire from the labour force early due to back problems will have a median value of total accumulated wealth by the time they are 65 of as little as $3708 (for women aged 55-64 years). This is far lower than the median value of accumulated wealth for those women aged 55-64 years who remained in the labour force full time, who will have $214,432 of accumulated wealth at age 65 years. Not only will early retirement due to back problems limit the immediate income available to individuals, but it will also reduce their long-term financial capacity by reducing their wealth accumulation. Maintaining the labour force participation of those with back problems, or preventing the onset of the disease, should be a priority in order to maintain living standards comparable with others who do not suffer from this condition."

        "webpage": "Spending, not Taxation, Is the Problem\nWith President Obama and various Republican presidential candidates competing to reduce corporate income taxes, it must be election time. Do you ever feel like you're living in a Latin American country, where the presidential candidates are notorious for offering all sorts of political candy to the voters during the campaign season?\nThe whole notion of reducing taxes is, of course, ridiculous. Why? Because as Milton Friedman pointed out, the real level of taxation is the amount of money the government is spending. Whatever the government is spending is what the government must collect in taxes. Thus, when spending exceeds tax revenues and the government lowers taxes on one group, another group will have to make up the difference with increased taxes.\nSuppose, for example, the government is spending $100,000. Suppose that there are three groups in society. Group A is paying $50,000 in taxes. Group B is paying $30,000. Group C is paying $20,000. The amount of ax revenues equals the amount of federal spending.\nDuring campaign season, in the attempt to garner votes, presidential candidates promise to lower taxes for people in Group A by $20,000.\nBut that's not all. The candidates also promise to deliver additional government welfare to all three groups, the total cost of which will be $30,000.\nThe mainstream media cheers! The voters are ecstatic. This is absolutely fantastic! Reduced taxes and increased benefits! Would could be better than that? We have the best presidential candidates in the whole world!\nBut there is obviously a big problem. With the campaign promises, government expenditures will total $130,000 (including the additional $30,000 in welfare benefits) while tax receipts (including the $30,000 reduction in taxes for Group A) now total $70,000. That's a $60,000 deficit..\nSince government gets its money through taxation, that's obviously a problem. The government must get the additional $60,000 from someone. By lowering taxes on Group A, the government must increase taxes on Groups A or B to cover the difference.\nOf course, the government could go into the capital markets and borrow the money, which is what the U.S. government, the Greek government, and many other governments have been doing for a long time. But that only delays the inevitable. When the bonds come due, taxes must be imposed on people to pay off the amount borrowed.\nAnother course of action, one that the U.S. government has used for decades, is simply to print the money rather than impose higher taxes on those people in Groups B and C. That's where the Federal Reserve, or central bank, comes into play. Its job is to enable public officials to pay off government debt in money that then constantly falls in value due to its ever-increasing supply.\nThat's, in fact, why the value of the U.S. dollar is worth only a fraction of what it was worth when the Fed was established. It's also why Americans are now relegating to using coins consisting of cheap alloys rather than gold and silver. The bad money drove out the good money.\nThe obvious benefit to inflation is that it enables politicians to promise tax cuts and welfare increases without overt tax increases to make up the difference. Politicians know that the mainstream media and most voters will look upon them as fantastic magicians who clearly love the people. When prices begin rising in response to the debased currency, the politicians know that the mainstream media and most people will never figure out that it is the government's doing. They'll inevitably blame the rising prices on \"big corporations,\" \"greed,\" or \"market forces.\"\nThe real problem facing our nation is the out-of-control spending  -  spending that far exceeds the amount of taxes being collected. That has led and continued to lead to out-of- control debt, which inevitably leads to inflationary debasement of the money supply by the Federal Reserve.\nAs long as spending continues to soar, the economic problems facing the American people will continue to grow, just as they will continue to grow for the people of Greece.\nThe best solution out of this morass, however, is not just to cut federal spending so that it equals tax revenues. Instead, the time has come for Americans to challenging the entire welfare-state paradigm and warfare-state paradigm that have brought us so many problems.\nRepealing and dismantling both the welfare state and the warfare state would mean no more socialist programs, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and no more overseas military empire or domestic military industrial complex. It would mean no more Federal Reserve. And it was mean no more income taxation, rendering moot political promises to reduce income taxes at election time."

(Credit: Images Money/Flickr) Decline in US household incomes likely to continue\nCornell University Posted by Bill Steele-Cornell on September 1, 2013 The median household income for Americans reached an all-time high in 2000, and has been falling ever since, a trend that's likely to continue for the next two decades due to demographic shifts, experts predict.\n\"The average American is increasingly going to be black, Hispanic, and older. Unless [these demographic groups] earn considerably more than has been the case in previous decades, the average American's household income is likely to fall,\" says Richard Burkhauser, a professor of policy analysis at Cornell University.\nWithout important changes in public policy, these forces will drive down median income by about 0.5 percent per year over the next two decades, according to an analysis by Burkhauser and Jeff Larrimore, a former member of Burkhauser's research group now with the Joint Committee on Taxation of the US Congress.\nTheir report will be a chapter in a Russell Sage Foundation book, Changing Times: America in a New Century, to be published later this year.\nMathematically, a median is the number exactly in the middle of a list; the report focuses on the person with median income as representing the \"average American.\" If the average American has less money to spend, economic growth will be slowed.\nBurkhauser and Larrimore drew on data from the Current Population Survey, in which the US Census Bureau annually interviews a sample of 60,000 households nationwide. Cornell has access to confidential census data through the Cornell Institute for Social and Economic Research.\nThey employed \"shift-share\" analysis, which shows how a particular group contributes to a change in the overall numbers.\nDemographic shifts\nThe most important contribution to declining income over the past decade, and particularly during the Great Recession and its aftermath, was the large number of unemployed men, they found.\nBut looking ahead, they predict that over the next two decades demographic shifts will be an important factor pulling the median down.Related Articles On FuturityUniversity of MarylandTurn corporate cash into 2.4 million jobsVanderbilt UniversityTitle loans are pricey, but most keep their carsNew York UniversityLocal killings affect kids' reading, test scores\nIn the 1990s and 2000s the Baby Boom generation, maturing into their peak earning years, helped to boost the median income.

The guidelines did not delve too much into specifics, offering more of a broad outline of the potential risk and compliance issues that can arise in the burgeoning social media channel. \"Financial institutions may use social media in a variety of ways, including marketing, providing incentives, facilitating applications for new accounts, inviting feedback from the public, and engaging with existing and potential customers, for example, by receiving and responding to complaints, or providing loan pricing,\" reads a portion of the FFIEC paper. \"Since this form of customer interaction tends to be informal and occurs in a less secure environment, it presents some unique challenges to financial institutions.\"\nThe FFIEC continues, \"A financial institution should have a risk management program that allows it to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks related to social media. The size and complexity of the risk management program should be commensurate with the breadth of the financial institution's involvement in this medium. For instance, a financial institution that relies heavily on social media to attract and acquire new customers should have a more detailed program than one using social media only to a very limited extent. The risk management program should be designed with participation from specialists in compliance, technology, information security, legal, human resources, and marketing.\"\nThe FFIEC cautioned banks that there are several areas of risk when engaging customers in social media. For example, if a bank uses social media to market products or originate new accounts, it must make sure all its communications are in accordance with laws such as the Truth in Savings Act, Truth in Lending Act, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act. which prohibits \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\" These are but a few of the myriad of risk concerns banks must take into account when engaging in social media. Matt Putvinski, director of Wolf & Company's IT Assurance Services group, says the guidelines \"are a good first step\" and expects to see more robust guidance offered by the FFIEC when it publishes its final version of the report after receiving feedback from financial institutions. \"I did like the fact that the paper talked about the inventory of social media channels and looked at the risk indicative in each one,\" he adds. \"There is some differences in the way you use Facebook as opposed to Twitter.\" Ultimately, Putvinski believes the bets way for financial institutions to mitigate risk related to social media is to have a clearly stated social media policy and to educate employees on the proper use of social media. \"Some might want to block access to social media sites from computers within the institution, but that can't stop someone from going on their phone and accessing them,\" he says. \"At the end of day it is a matter of education in this area, the best thing you can do is tell people the best practices and most people will follow them.\" [See Also: Creating a FINRA-Friendly Social Media Plan]\nMrJesseTorres,\nre: The Compliance Risk of Social Media Hope these tools  Media Risk Assessment:-\ufffd Media Policy:-\ufffd Media Training ...\nre: The Compliance Risk of Social Media -\ufffdProbably not worrying about it too seriously now, but when concrete regulations come up around the use of social media, they will.

But even elsewhere, say pharmaceuticals, for example, the guidelines released by governing bodies are just as broad as the FFIEC proposed guidelines seem to be, so these new social compliance officers will have to rely on innovation and best practices and a strong understanding of the Truth in Savings Act and other laws to navigate this growing area of concern.

The guidelines don't seem to amount to much more than \"be careful\" and \"don't violate existing government regulations.\" I wonder if, like with most other things, institutions will only be forced to take action after something bad happens, or laws are passed with more than just guidelines (likely BECAUSE something bad happens).\nre: The Compliance Risk of Social Media -\ufffdYes, I do think this will eventually lead to a \"social media compliance officer\" type of position. Reply | Post Message | Messages List | Start a Board\nre: The Compliance Risk of Social Media This is quite interesting. Do you think risk management for social media will become a new field of specialization within financial services? But the notion of banning FS employees from accessing social media on their mobile phones, seems to contradict the point of social media."

Nearly 60 percent of the imports moving through the port come from China.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary John Bryson also encouraged more Chinese investment, commenting that \"America is truly open for business.\" However, he called for balancing the economic and trade relationship, which has been a lightning rod for critics of China.\nTrade between the two countries increased exponentially last year but the U.S. trade deficit also grew by 30 percent, Bryson said.\n\"We have to work harder to achieve balanced trade growth,\" he said.\nAny view that the U.S. is the loser in its trade relationship with China \"does not square with facts,\" Xi said through a translator.\nChinese imports have helped Americans improve their standard of living and created more than 3 million new jobs in the U.S. from 2001 to 2010, Xi said.\nU.S.-China trade is expected to top $500 billion soon, and the countries have moved from \"mutual estrangement to a close exchange with increasingly intertwined interests,\" he said.\nOutside the hotel hosting the trade forum, picketers protested Chinese policies in Tibet and its treatment of Falun Gong followers. Two protesters were cited for standing in the roadway but no one was arrested, Los Angeles Police spokesman Cleon Joseph said.\nAfter the trade forum, Xi and Biden visited a suburban school in South Gate that specializes in Asian studies to promote more American students studying in China.\nThe vice presidents watched a traditional Chinese \"dragon dance\" performed by middle- and high-school students at the International Studies Learning Center, a public school that is part of the Asia Society's network of schools across the country.\n\"You are an impressive group of students,\" Biden said. \"Thank you for making America look so good.\"\nBiden told the students that the U.S.-China relationship is the single most important relationship the country has in the 21st century. He said he and President Barack Obama believe that the most significant factor in improving U.S.-China ties is increasing educational opportunity for American students in China.\nUnder the 100,000 Strong Initiative, the White House aims to have at least that many American students studying in China.\nXi, who spoke with a class of high school students learning Chinese, lauded their Mandarin skills, saying it was important to learn the culture as well as the language to avoid misunderstandings.\nLater, Xi and Biden both addressed a luncheon at the trade forum, saying how they had developed a close, personal friendship through visits. \"I can say with confidence my visit has been a full success,\" Xi said.\nThe officials then met with governors of seven Chinese provinces and five U.S. states and one U.S. territory  -  the Northern Mariana Islands  -  to further promote commerce.\n\"We have a significant opportunity to increase trade with China but we have some impediments on both sides,\" Biden said. \"We are working through them. We are convinced they can be overcome.\"\nBiden said he appreciated Xi's candor. \"He is very, very direct. When we disagree, there's a clear statement of disagreement,\" Biden said. \"I was impressed by how much he wants to know about how our system works.\"\nXi was scheduled to attend a Lakers game before departing.\nXi's U.S. tour comes at a politically challenging time in U.S.-China relations, with the White House sending stern messages on currency exchange, intellectual property protection and trade policies, and Republican presidential candidates claiming Obama isn't doing enough to keep America's economy competitive with China's.\nThe Asian power sells four times as many goods to the U.S. as the United States sends in return to China. However, China became the top market for U.S. agricultural goods last year, purchasing $20 billion in U.S. agricultural exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture."

        "webpage": "Obama decides not to extend term of jobs council\nBy JOSH LEDERMANAssociated Press\nGeneral Electric Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt listens at right as President Barack Obama meets with the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. WASHINGTON, D.C.  -  President Barack Obama is letting his jobs council expire, cutting off one source of input from business leaders while unemployment remains stubbornly high.\nObama formed the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in January 2011, when unemployment was about 9 percent. It's now 7.8 percent, though more than 12 million people are out of work.\nObama's executive order establishing the council said it would go out of business Jan. 31, 2013. The White House said Thursday that Obama had no plans to renew its charter.\n\"The work of the jobs council was very valuable,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \"While the president didn't agree with all of its recommendations, he agreed with many of them and acted on a number of them.\"\nWhite House officials said Obama intended for the council to fulfill its mission and then wind down, and that he would seek input about the economy from business leaders in other ways. Among the steps Obama plans to pursue are expedited permits for public works projects, plus programs to boost entrepreneurship and workforce development.\nEven before Obama's decision was clear, Republicans seized on the council's likely expiration as evidence the president hadn't spent enough time on trying to create jobs, which is a priority for Americans. The Republican National Committee called it part of \"the failed Obama record,\" while the House Republicans' campaign committee, in an online petition, accused Obama of laying off his own jobs council.\nAdding to the concern about the job market's vulnerability, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December of last year, the first quarterly drop since 2009. The Federal Reserve said the economy appears to have \"paused in recent months.\"\nThe jobs council was a successor to an economic advisory board Obama created at the onset of his presidency. The panel was chaired by General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt and included prominent business leaders and economists. Immelt said Thursday that progress has been made on putting in place 90 percent of the council's recommendations.\nObama met with the council only a few times. During the last meeting, in February 2012, the president and the council highlighted an engineering education initiative alongside school deans.\n\"The president treated his jobs council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nThe council's main product was a report, \"Roadmap to Renewal,\" that was released in January 2012. The council also organized a series of meetings across the country last year with business owners, elected officials and academics; Obama didn't attend those election-year sessions.\nCritics have argued that the council's primary purpose was to create the appearance of action at a time when the nation was pining for something to rein in soaring joblessness. The administration acted on many of the council's recommendations, including suggestions to streamline permitting and small business loans, increase tourist visas and boost energy efficiency.\nBut the White House was at odds with several council members on tax policies, particularly a proposal to exclude overseas corporate earnings from U.S. taxes. That idea divided even the jobs council, whose membership included labor and Obama's political allies.\n\"It was helpful in terms of putting a spotlight on a variety of issues, but particularly helpful in the area of entrepreneurship,\" said AOL co-founder Steve Case, a member of the panel, in an interview. \"There's still work to be done, but we did make good progress.\"\nThe council's dissolution also comes as White House aides are optimistic about the prospects for a second-term detente with business.\nDuring Obama's first term, business leaders bristled at his harsh depiction of \"fat-cat bankers\" and his efforts to impose regulations, tax policies and spending initiatives they argued were unfriendly to business. Obama aides hope the warming of ties between the president and the business world can benefit the White House in future fiscal debates with Republicans.\nWhite House officials said the president made a fresh effort to reach out to business in the days following his re-election. Between the November election and the end of 2012, in the height of negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff,\" more than 400 business leaders, ranging from CEOs of large multinational companies to small business owners, met with Obama or his aides at the White House, officials said."

Garsson(202) 874-5770\nComptroller Dugan Defends Strong National Standards for Financial Providers\nWASHINGTON  -  Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan said today that uniform national standards have proved to be a powerful engine for prosperity and growth, and urged Congress to strengthen federal consumer protection rules and ensure they are applied to all providers of the same financial products.While many parts of the Treasury Department's regulatory reform proposal would enhance consumer protection, provisions that would repeal preemption should be rejected, Mr. Dugan said in a speech to Women in Housing and Finance.\"This radical change is fundamentally at odds with the concept of efficient national standards for national products and services offered across state lines in national markets - a concept that has been central to the economic prosperity of the United States since the adoption of our Constitution, and one that has been critical to the flourishing of our national banking system since 1863,\" he said.Mr. Dugan noted that key parts of the Treasury plan promote the concept of uniform national standards, and said that one of the critical benefits of the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency would be to ensure that consistent federal rules apply to all financial providers, including the \"shadow banking system\" of nonbank lenders that was responsible for the largest share of the most abusive subprime loans that fueled the financial crisis.However, the Treasury proposal would allow states to adopt and enforce different rules, which would result in a patchwork of federal and state laws that disadvantage consumers and give rise to significant uncertainty about which sets of standards apply to institutions conducting a multistate business.\"More fundamentally, we live in an era where the market for financial products and services is often national in scope,\" Mr. Dugan said. \"In this context, regressing to a regulatory regime that fails to recognize the way retail financial services are now provided, and the need for a single set of rules for banks with customers in multiple states, would discard many benefits consumers reap from our modern financial product delivery system.\"There are a number of areas in which complying with different standards set by individual states would require a bank to determine which state's law governs - the law of the state where the product or service is provided, the law of the home state of the bank, or the law of the state where the consumer is located, and \"it is far from clear how a bank could do this based on objective analysis, and any conflicts could result in penalties and litigation in multiple jurisdictions,\" the Comptroller said.In the case of checking accounts, he said, there could be differences in rules on the number and amount of withdrawals or deposits, permissible minimum balance requirements and ATM screen disclosures. States could assert that these requirements apply according to the law of the state in which the branch offering the account is located, the home state of the bank, the state where the customer resides, or someplace else.\"How would a bank advertise in the newspaper or on the radio to promote its checking accounts if it were located in a multistate region - such as the Washington DC area - if different states imposed different requirements regarding terms and disclosures?\" he asked.\"Even if the bank figured all this out for a particular customer, that could all change if the customer moved, or if the bank merged with another bank located in a different state,\" he said. \"Would that mean the customer would have to open a new account to incorporate the state's required terms? And even if Congress added language to address some of the questions we can think of today, there would only be more uncertainties tomorrow - and no realistic possibility of writing a fix into national law each time a new issue arose.\"The Comptroller also noted that many arguments for abandoning preemption are simply wrong, including the notion that national banks were the source of predatory and unsafe mortgage loans, while state institutions were not.\"It is widely recognized that the worst subprime loans that have caused the most foreclosures were originated by nonbank lenders and brokers regulated exclusively by the states. Although the OCC has little rulewriting authority in this area, we have closely supervised national bank subprime lending practices. As a result, national banks originated a relatively smaller share of subprime loans and applied better standards, resulting in significantly fewer foreclosures - as demonstrated in an attachment to this speech prepared last year by OCC staff,\" he said.\"Meanwhile, nothing in federal law precluded states from effectively regulating their own nonbank mortgage lenders and brokers,\" he added. \"Indeed, that's why the plan's grant of strong rulewriting and enforcement authority at the federal level over the shadow banking system of unregulated financial providers, through the CFPA, is such a good idea.\"Related LinksRemarks before Women in Housing and FinanceOCC Paper on Worst 10 Mortgage OriginatorsComptroller of the Currency John C.

        "webpage": "Cyprus Lifts the Curtain (Peter Schiff)This week financial analysts, economists, politicians, and bank depositors from around the world were outraged that European leaders, more specifically the Germans, currently calling many of the shots in Brussels and Frankfurt, could be so politically reckless, economically ignorant, and emotionally callous as to violate the sanctity of bank deposits in order to fund a bailout of Cyprus. The chorus of condemnation may have been the deciding factor in giving the Cypriot parliament the confidence to unanimously vote down the measures in hopes that Berlin will cave or Russia will swoop in with a bailout.\nThe decision to inflict pain on both large and small depositors was almost universally described as a historic blunder. But the mistake was to do so in a manner that was not camouflaged by financial smoke and mirrors. In truth, rank and file depositors have been paying, and will continue to pay, for all manner of bailouts and stimulus. (Read about the Stimulus Trap in my just released newsletter). Whether it's through lower interest payments on deposits, inflation, higher taxes, higher borrowing costs, or the accumulation of unsustainable sovereign debt, Cypriots will bear the burden of past profligacy. But the new plan for Cyprus was far too transparent, simple, and direct to survive in a world dependent on deceit and obfuscation. It was dead on arrival.\nAll over the world, most notably in the United States, Britain and Japan, central bankers are actively pursuing inflation targets of two to three percent. But isn't inflation, which allows governments to pay off debt through the creation of new money that transfers purchasing power from savers to borrowers, just a deposit tax in disguise? (Read more about Japan's plan to do just that). British citizens of all means have been living with such a three percent stealth tax for the past three years, and it is expected to stay that high for at least two more years. Yet a one-time tax of 6.75% in Cyprus is seen as the ultimate act of betrayal? Many are lamenting that Cyprus' membership in the EU prevents it from devaluing its own currency to get out of the jam. How would such a course be morally superior? Taking actual losses on deposits is no different than taking losses through devaluation and inflation. Both result in the loss of purchasing power. Asking for a depositor haircut at least deals with the problem honestly and immediately. Although it's not quite as honest, devaluation can also be effective.\nThe same dynamic holds true with bailout funds. Suppose the EU were to come through with more funds? All that means is that Cypriots will have to pay more in future debt and interest repayments. In so doing they would saddle future generations with a burden that they had no hand in creating. How is that fair? And it's not as if depositors at Cypriot banks, many of whom are reported to be Russian citizens seeking tax havens, were not complicit in the risk taking. Bloomberg reports that over the past five years euro deposits at Cyprus banks returned more than 24 percent cumulatively, almost double the returns on comparable German accounts. The banks were able to offer such returns because they were exposed to riskier assets (i.e. Greek government bonds). What's so wrong with asking those who took greater risks to earn higher returns to give something back when their decisions go bad?\nCypriot citizens, as members of the EU, had the choice to put their deposits in any EU bank. Even after paying the taxes that had been proposed in the bailout, long-term depositors would have made more money by keeping their savings in th"

        "webpage": "Statement by SEC Chairman:\nRemarks at the Commission Open Meeting\nChairman Harvey L. Pitt\nGood morning. This is an open meeting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January 8, 2003, our first of the New Year.\nIt begins a month in which Congress directed the Commission to complete what I believe is the most extensive rulemaking agenda in the shortest period of time in the agency's history. When we finally turn the page on the calendar at the end of this month, we will have considered nine final rules and produced four major studies related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To put that in perspective, the Commission adopted a total of 23 final rules in all twelve months of 2000.\nConsidering the obligations we have under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission's chief focus on the rulemaking front of late necessarily has been implementing the Act. This does not mean, however, that we can or will let other important efforts fall by the wayside. Investment Company Transactions with Portfolio and Subadviser Affiliates The first item on the calendar is a fine example of the regular work of the Commission continuing apace during these extraordinary times. The Division of Investment Management recommends that we adopt rule amendments to permit investment companies to engage in transactions with affiliated subadvisers and portfolio companies without first obtaining an exemptive order from the Commission. In the past decade we have seen a number of changes in the way that funds operate. Fund investment advisers, who once managed a small number of funds, today may manage a dozen or more funds, and these investment advisers often rely on subadvisers to manage the funds' investment portfolios.\nThese changes in business practice, coupled with the affiliated transaction prohibitions of the Investment Company Act, have produced unnecessary consequences. Funds are constrained from buying or selling shares of a company in which another fund in the same complex owns a significant stake, and subadvisers to one fund cannot do business with any other funds in the same complex, even funds that they do not manage. Even though the risk of harm to funds and their investors is, at most, theoretical, the affiliated transaction provisions of the statue prohibit these transactions.\nThe amendments we are considering today would help restore balance to our regulation of affiliated transactions. They would allow funds and advisers to engage in transactions with these remote affiliates without having to obtain individual exemptive orders from the Commission, which Congress authorized us to permit in appropriate circumstances.\nThese amendments should reduce costs for funds and the millions of investors who own fund shares, without sacrificing one iota of investor protection. The amendments would also permit the Commission and its staff to shift precious resources away from routine exemptive applications that do not raise investor protection concerns and toward novel and/or complicated applications, allowing more timely resolution for funds and their investors. Standards Relating to Listed Company Audit Committees\nThe second item on today's calendar is a recommendation from the Division of Corporation Finance that the Commission propose new Exchange Act Rule 10A-3, pursuant to Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 301 of the Act requires the Commission to direct national securities exchanges and national securities associations to adopt certain listing requirements related to the independence and functioning of their listed companies' audit committees, including\nthat they be responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of any registered public accounting firm employed to perform audit services; all members be independent of the issuer; and they have complaint procedures, the authority to engage advisers, and the ability to determine appropriate funding for the audit.\nOnce implemented by the self-regulatory organizations, the Section 301 listing standards will be an important complement to other SRO listing standards related to corporate governance, both existing and planned."

Brown of TheReformedBroker.com reveals \"the reality behind all the false glamour, contrived accuracy, and manufactured confidence\" in Backstage Wall Street: An Insider's Guide to Knowing Who to Trust, Who to Run From, and How to Maximize Your Investments (McGraw-Hill, 2012). Brown escaped from the brokerage business in 2010 after a decade of being in \"the very worst profession in all of financial services.\" As he writes, \"I will starve on the street before I will ever be a retail stockbroker again.\" (p. 34)\nBy relating in graphic detail how brokers' interests were misaligned with their clients', Brown brings to life a story that investors may have heard before but most likely didn't heed sufficiently. He explains how ordinary folks got involved in the stock market in the first place, how financial entrepreneurs created enticing investment products (think mutual funds and ETFs), and how stock brokers didn't care what they sold - they just had to sell, sell, sell.\nHe caps off his tale with the script for the Straight-Line Pitch (also known as the Lehman Method). This \"infamous but never-before-published script\" has \"sold thousands of stock ideas and opened millions of retail brokerage accounts over the last 50 years.\" (p. 173) In a call that can last between ten minutes and two hours, the broker makes a pitch, encounters an objection, rebuts that objection, encounters another objection, rebuts that one as well, and eventually aims for the power close. The script is almost thirty pages long. He describes common objections, such as \"let me call you back,\" \"I don't like the market right now,\" \"send me some information on the stock or your firm,\" or \"let me speak to my wife about this.\" For each objection there are at least four rebuttals. Apparently \"one out of ten qualified investors will open a new account when a broker uses this pitch.\" (p. 173) Frightening! By the way, men are much more receptive to the straight-line pitch than women are.\nMajor traditional brokerage firms no longer pitch to the small account; for the most part they've moved into wealth management. For some time online brokers have at least partially filled that void, catering to the do-it-yourself investor. Brown recalls the days of the dot.com frenzy, describing the \"borderline psychotic\" advertising campaigns of online brokers. \"The central conceit of the online brokerages' ad campaigns back then was that any schmuck could be a billionaire and that riches were only clicks away.\" (p. 71) His criticism is on target. But I think he's too kind to today's online brokerage campaigns to enlist clients, asking for instance \"who doesn't love the E*TRADE Baby?\" Me, for one. And he doesn't mention those \"trade free for 60 days\" come-ons that encourage overtrading and that are designed to generate lots of commissions after the initial free period. There's always a pitch somewhere.\nBrown offers tips for staying out of \"murder holes\" - such demonic investment vehicles as SPACs (special-purpose acquisition corporations), Chinese reverse mergers, one-drug biotechs, and private placements. Even as you're avoiding these murder holes, beware of other investor traps as well. My favorite is: \"Brokers with thick New York accents and Boca Raton area codes. (Florida's Homestead Act has led to a preponderance of bad guys from New York setting up shop in southern Florida; the civil courts can't touch their property.\" (p. 220)\nBackstage Wall Street is a quick-paced, well-written book by someone who's been there and done some of that.

Technology's impact on lending\nBack from the brink\neBay's old-school business wisdom\n\u00a9 Nathan Mandell\nNobel Prize Laureate and Princeton Psychology Professor Daniel Kahneman addresses the Kellogg School on the subject of behavioral economics during the May 2004 Nancy L. Schwartz Memorial Lecture.\nBehave yourself!\nBehavioral finance adds 'psychological realism' to an academic discipline with a reputation for embracing the theoretical\nBy Deborah Leigh Wood Paola Sapienza and Christopher Polk don't consider themselves staunch supporters of behavioral finance, which rejects the popular efficient markets theory in favor of the belief that behavioral factors associated with decision-making can cause inefficiencies in financial markets. Nevertheless, these assistant professors of finance at the Kellogg School saw enough evidence of this relatively new theory to pique their interest in discovering whether market inefficiencies have influence on manager's real investment decisions, such as capital expenditure.\nWhat they emerged with in their working research paper, \"The Real Effects of Investor Sentiment,\" is that misvaluation of stock prices may influence capital investment. In other words, macroeconomic output can be distorted by inefficient stock markets.\nThe authors say their paper is controversial because it suggests new consequences when human error and/or market frictions allow stock prices to get out of whack. Behavioral finance, and more generally behavioral economics, does have its share of highly respected proponents, including Sapienza's adviser, Andrei Schleifer, professor of economics at Harvard University, and Daniel Kahneman, this spring's Nancy L. Schwartz Memorial Lecture speaker at the Kellogg School. Kahneman, professor of psychology and professor of public affairs at Princeton University, was named the 2002 Nobel Prize Laureate for his psychological insights into economic science.\nThough applications in finance are relatively new, behavioral theories originated as long as 30 years ago, growing out of research into the influence of rewards and punishments on decision-making, conducted at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nBehavioral finance also has its detractors, chief among them Eugene Fama, who in the 1960s developed the \"market knows best\" theory at the University of Chicago - where he served as Polk's mentor.\n\"I haven't yet told him about the paper,\" Polk says with a wry smile.\nWhile most behavioral finance research focuses on \"who gains and who loses,\" says Sapienza, she and Polk wanted to know about \"the real economic consequences\" of overvalued and undervalued stock. Could a manager of an overvalued company invest in projects that rationally should be considered as negative net present value (NPV) but are temporarily in vogue by players in the stock market? Similarly, could managers of undervalued companies forgo positive NPV projects because the market is overly pessimistic about their prospects?\nTheir interpretation of anecdotal evidence concerning the online grocer Webvan drove Polk and Sapienza's early discussions about the real effects of investor sentiment. Early in its existence, each time that the startup announced the opening of another $25 million automated warehouse, its stock price increased. Only later did investors realize that that expensive technology did not automatically turn a questionable business model into a profitable enterprise, as evidenced by Webvan's bankruptcy in 2001, after a short shelf life of two years.\n\"A CEO may be concerned about stock prices in the short run, but in the long run [investing in negative NPV projects] destroys the company's value, hurting the economy,\" Sapienza says. She and Polk found patterns in stock returns consistent with overpriced firms investing too much and underpriced firms not investing enough. Companies that had relatively low investment had stock returns that were subsequently high (after controlling for investment opportunities and other characteristics linked to return predictability). Companies (like Webvan) with relatively high investment subsequently underperformed. Sapienza points out that this evidence confirms a link between market inefficiencies and some of the most important decisions within firms, including \"not only how a firm chooses its amount of physical capital but also how many people a firm employs and how a firm budgets R&D.\"\nPolk says he and Sapienza believe most skeptics would at least grant that during the Internet bubble of the 1990s, many entrepreneurs built startups based on misleading measures, such as the number of projected Web clicks, rather than on justifiable financial analysis such as NPV. From that common ground, Polk hopes that these skeptics will consider their research as an attempt to see if similar mistakes occurred in other time periods.\nThe lesson for companies focused on the stock price in the short run, Sapienza says, is that eventually \"the market catches up with you.\"\n\u00a92002 Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University"

        "webpage": "Fun as an economic gauge\nSeptember 29, 1999 Save for later\nMeasuring living standards is no snap for economists. It opens the way for disputes over whether Americans are better off today than, say, 20 years ago.Liberal economists tend to be on the gloomy side. They frequently would like the government to give the poor a boost. Reforms are needed. Conservatives are commonly on the upbeat side. That suits a preference for less government intervention. If all is fairly hunky-dory, Washington's help is not needed. The economic system is working.The usual way to measure prosperity is to look at changes over time of total income per person after inflation. More money, it's assumed, means better living standards. These statistics aren't too cheery. Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute, reckons that the typical worker's wages only recovered their 1989 level earlier this year.\nBut economist Dora Costa cautions: \"Real income is an imperfect measure of trends in living standards.\" For one thing, the consumer price index exaggerates inflation. So real income is higher than measured by the CPI. Also, real income doesn't account for such goods as health that aren't purchased in the marketplace, for some quality improvements, for technological change, and for increases in leisure, Ms. Costa maintains.\nAnother way to examine living standards is to count the products and services consumed by a household - the square footage of a home, how many bathrooms, the number of TVs, VCRs, phones, cars, and so on.W. Michael Cox, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, has explored this technique for several years.\"We've experienced splendid economic progress over the past quarter century...we should give thanks for the blessings of free enterprise,\" he says in a new book he co-authored, \"Myths of Rich & Poor: Why We're Better Off Than We Think.\"Costa, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has a third method for estimating living standards - an examination of recreation spending trends since 1888. This technique assumes that people, after providing for food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities, use some of whatever income is left over on purchasing recreation. As the proportion of income needed for necessities declines, they will have more money for vacations, radios, TVs, CDs, concerts, circuses, dances, toys, pets, sports, novels, newspapers, magazines, pianos, and other recreational goods and activities that strike their fancy. Rising recreational expenditures - \"the quintessential luxury goods\" - are seen as a sign of rising living standards.Using old and more recent surveys, Costa figures living standards have risen faster than conventional income measures indicate, particularly during times of innovation in consumer goods and reductions in work hours such as in the 1920s and the 1970s and 1980s.In the late 1880s, less than 2 percent of household spending was devoted to recreation. By 1991, it had risen to 6 percent.Recreational expenditures also tend to rise with income. At the start of this century, pleasure spending was a luxury not affordable to low-income households. By the mid-1930s, low-cost recreational activities, such as motoring, movies, and radio had already spread widely. Meanwhile hours of work declined, and health improved as public health spending increased.Costa finds that income underestimates living standards by 2.4 percentage points per year between 1919 and 1935, and 1.8 percentage points per year between 1972 and 1991. So even during the Great Depression, living standards rose - for those with jobs. Liberal economists admit that Americans are accumulating more \"things\" than in the past. And they acknowledge that entertainment and the time to enjoy it is more abundant. But they point to the gloomy side. Income has become more skewed to the rich in the past two decades. It takes two earners in a family to provide all those goods. Rent and university education have become much more expensive. The poor, presumably stressed by their financial status, tend to be less healthy. Because they can't afford campaign contributions, the poor have less say in politics. Commutes have become worse.Trends in living standards, in other words, are fuzzy, not black and white.*David R. Francis is senior economic correspondent for the Monitor.(c) Copyright 1999.

While banks understand the benefits of using more modern systems, they often shy away from the transition because of its complex process. Transforming core banking systems often involves a multi-year, multi-phase makeover that can be costly and time intensive. Additionally, where banks are expected to provide their services 24/7, replacing these core systems can significantly impact their ability to service their customers. Also, in recent years, financial institutions have experienced a significant increase in regulatory requirements, making it more cumbersome than ever to properly integrate these new systems onto their platforms.\nHowever, banks do not have the option to put off this core system transformation for much longer. The economics of the industry are no longer allowing these financial institutions to continue to delay this inevitable renovation, as the benefits far outweigh the negatives. Modern banking systems allow banks to be more flexible and enable them to act more efficiently in response to the changing market opportunities. For example, on a newer, more modern system, banks have the capabilities to launch products more quickly by reusing already existing components rather than having to replace individual parts on legacy systems. Unlike legacy systems, modern systems also allow banks to have a single and complete view of the customer in real- time. Finally, research has shown that banks that stay on these legacy systems ultimately spend more money trying to upgrade their systems piece by piece than they would if embraced a newer, more modern platform. [The challenges of core systems modernization projects: Pride and Prejudice and Core Systems]\nNot surprisingly, banking institutions worldwide are investing in technologies that help them modernize their existing systems. For example, Indian banks went through this complicated process between 2004 and 2008. Now, five years later, all of these banks are on real-time views, are heavily involved in e-banking, have reduced process turnaround and are better at understanding customer insight. Banks in China, Eastern Europe and the EU market also are undergoing this major transformation, which shows that this is truly a global transformation for the banking industry.\nRecent research also has indicated that the global banking industry could regain a significant proportion of the profitability lost during the financial crisis by adopting these new modern-day systems. According to new research by Temenos and Deloitte, the implementation of modern banking platforms could close the gap by as much as 60%, or US $180 billion. Over the past three years alone, banks that have adopted these new modern platforms have experienced on average 25% higher return on assets and a 37% higher return on capital compared to banks that are still running on their legacy applications.\nOnce financial institutions realize that this change needs to occur, they can begin the replacement process. This typically begins with building a business case. A bank must identify the specific problems that need to be solved to ensure it is receiving a valuable return on investment. For example, banks should ensure that they replace their existing systems with a centralized platform that can deliver speed to market and is more flexible and accountable. It is no secret that replacing your bank's core legacy system is a major endeavor for any bank to undertake. However, it does not have to be as challenging and costly as many assume. By investing the right resources into modernizing these systems, banking institutions can not only save money but also advance their customer offerings.

Melvin Watt, D-N.C, said of the House action. \"It is a statement by the American people that it is time for us to straighten up the ship.\"\n\nBlame Them For Your Empty Wallet\n\nAware of voter outrage about the bonuses, Republicans were reluctant in Friday's debate to push back, even though they voted overwhelmingly against the bill. They said severe restrictions should apply only to banks that accept government aid. The legislation's ban on risky compensation would apply to any firm with more than $1 billion in assets, including bank holding companies, broker-dealers, credit unions, investment advisers and mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nThe White House and Senate Democrats haven't endorsed the measure, leaving its prospects uncertain. The Senate Banking Committee planned to take up the proposal in the fall as part of a broader bill overhauling financial regulations.\n\n\"Obviously it has some important things that we think need to become law, and we'll take a look at the full bill,\" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Friday.\n\nThe legislation includes President Barack Obama's suggestion that shareholders get a nonbinding vote on compensation packages. It also would prohibit members of compensation committees from having financial ties to the company and its executives, as Obama wanted.\n\nBut House Democrats added a provision that would require regulators to issue new guidelines prohibiting pay packages that encourage \"inappropriate risks\" that could \"threaten the safety and soundness\" of the institution or \"have serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability.\"\n\nRep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the extra regulation would ensure that bankers and traders who take big risks and lose on them don't continue to get rewarded anyway.\n\nWithout such restraint, \"the company loses money and the economy may suffer, but the decision makers do not,\" said Frank, D-Mass.\n\nCorporate pay became a hot-button issue for the public and Congress this spring when American International Group Inc. paid $165 million in bonuses to its employees after accepting $182 billion as a federal bailout. Among the employees in line for the rewards were those who worked in the financial products division, which underwrote the risky credit derivative contracts that nearly destroyed the company.\n\nThe House angrily responded by voting to tax away the bonuses, but momentum behind that legislation waned as Obama warned against vilifying Wall Street and investors who were crucial to restoring the economy.\n\nThen, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo reported this week that large bailed-out banks, including Bank of America Corp., Merrill Lynch & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., had awarded about 4,800 million-dollar-plus bonuses.\n\nCitigroup, which is now one-third owned by the government after taking $45 billion in federal money, gave 738 of its employees bonuses of at least $1 million, even after it lost $18.7 billion during the year, Cuomo's office said\n\nSince the new legislation would apply to companies not receiving bailout money, the effect will be to force \"financial institutions who did not contribute to the crisis to pay for the mistakes of others,\" said Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del.\n\nRep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, said a better solution would be to terminate the $700 billion bank bailout program established last year.\n\nFrank snapped back: \"We are not taking orders from the Obama administration.\"\n\nAlso on Friday, a group of 11 bipartisan senators pressed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to name the financial institutions that have received emergency assistance from the Fed and disclose how much help each received.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has invoked its emergency powers to provide assistance to some banks but has not disclosed the details out of concern that the information might cause a run on the institutions.\n\nThe senators, led by North Dakota Democrat Byron Dorgan and Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, said the information should be released now that banks are reporting profits and paying back the bailout money."

That would be the same as last year's pace, which was the weakest in 13 years.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index of domestic Chinese shares sank 1.1 percent on Monday last week to the lowest level this year after the GDP data. The gauge rebounded later for its first weekly gain in a month.The pace of economic growth in the first quarter marked the first time in data going back two decades that four periods in a row have seen expansion of less than 8 percent.China's long-term growth rate may be limited by declines in the working-age population, income gains that are pushing up costs and public concern at the environmental toll from polluting factories.Li pledged last year to open the economy to more market forces and strip power from the government as part of efforts to restructure the economy.The statement cited views the Chinese delegation expressed to the meeting of central bank governors and finance ministers from the G20 nations in Washington last week. Zhou and Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei (\u6a13\u7e7c\u5049) both took part in the event.\"China's structural adjustment has scored notable achievements,\" according to the PBOC statement.The contribution of service industries to economic growth in the first quarter exceeded that of manufacturing for the first time, it said.In his statement to the IMF, which was posted on the lender's Web site, Zhou reiterated that changes in China's financial sector will involve \"further interest-rate liberalization, capital account convertibility and exchange rate reform.\""

The city was hosting the \"Invest in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Forum (ICI) 2014,\" a conference bringing together more than 2,000 participants, including entrepreneurs, government officials, business people and development partners. The Forum's objective is to mount a large-scale mobilization of private-sector support for economic recovery as C\u00f4te d'Ivoire gets back on its feet after 10 years of political upheaval that has shaken the country's economic and social foundations, causing it to lose its status as West Africa's driving force.\nThe Ivorian Government intends to use this Forum to restore investor confidence by sharing its vision for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's development in the years ahead.\nIn an opinion piece published on the Forum's website, President Alassane Ouattara expressed his aspirations for his country: \"We are striving to be the subregion's hub, the entry point to West Africa, a market of over 300 million individuals. Reaching this goal entails forging strong, sustainable partnerships with economic operators who can seize the opportunities created by growth.\"\nIn 2012, GDP growth stood at 9.8% (compared to a negative rate of -4.7% in 2011), and in 2013, growth was estimated at around 9%. The country aims for double-digit growth in 2014-2015.\nImproving the ability for entrepreneurs and others to do business in Cote d'Ivoire has become a chief government priority. According to the report Doing Business 2014, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is among the countries that implemented the highest number of reforms in improving the business climate in the 2012-2013 period. Conferences and workshops held over the four-day investment Forum will focus on agribusiness, economic infrastructure, public-private partnerships, the promotion of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and renewable energy --all investment opportunities that the government hopes will attract investors to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nIn his remarks at the opening ceremony of the Forum, Makhtar Diop, World Bank vice president for the Africa Region, commended C\u00f4te d'Ivoire for the major reforms it has implemented to support the private sector. \"We all know the private sector is the engine of wealth and job creation,\" he stated, \"and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire offers a host of opportunities, particularly in the agribusiness sector.\" The country's central location, he added, provides access to a vast regional market. \" We all know the private sector is the engine of wealth and job creation. \"Makhtar Diop\nWorld Bank vice president for the Africa Region\nUnwavering World Bank support\n\"The World Bank Group has supported the Government's efforts to attract investors not only through technical support but also through numerous financing programs intended, among other things, to improve the business climate and promote competitiveness in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire,\" explains Lorenzo Bertolini, senior private-sector development specialist for the World Bank in Africa.\nIn infrastructure for instance, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has provided over US$700 million in investment guarantees backing US$2 billion in direct investments for three major projects: building a third bridge in Abidjan, boosting production capacity for the Azito thermal power plant along with financing from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and constructing a new gas platform together with an IDA partial risk guarantee.\nThe World Bank Group has been paying close attention not only to the development of Small and medium sized enterprises, but also to helping Cote d'Ivoire with its business climate improvements  -  for example, by creating a commercial court, establishing an anti-racketeering unit, and reducing the time needed to start a business and obtain a construction permit.\nA day before the opening of the forum, Air France's brand new superjumbo, double decker Airbus 380 landed at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny international airport in Abidjan (a first for francophone Africa), symbolizing the private sector's renewed commitment to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.

Floating markets in Thailand feature the old style and traditional way of selling goods from small boats on canals between traditional Thai houses and are also popular tourist attractions. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj\nWASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The financing arm of the World Bank launched a $600 million programme on Wednesday to support lending to women-owned small businesses as part of its drive to promote gender equality and economic opportunities for women.\nThe Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility will help as many as 100,000 women running small and medium enterprises in emerging markets gain access to financing, the International Finance Corp (IFC) said in a news release.\nAn estimated $300 billion credit gap exists for women-owned enterprises, according to IFC research. Failure to recognise the credit-worthiness of women, and unfavourable business and regulatory conditions are some of the barriers that impede development of women-owned businesses, it said. The new facility will extend lines of credit and share risk with local banks in developing countries as a way to support bank initiatives to provide loans to women entrepreneurs, the IFC said.\nInez Murray, chief executive of the Global Banking Alliance for Women, welcomed the initiative, noting that women account for one-third of small- and medium-sized enterprises and yet banks grant them only a fraction of the available credit. This discrepancy exists even though women have proven themselves to be profitable bank customers. They have a better track record than men in repaying loans and a higher savings ratio, plus they purchase a wide range of bank products, she said.\n\"A lack of awareness on the part of banks and a lack of understanding on how to reach the women's market are holding back bank lending to women,\" Murray said at a White House event on women and economic empowerment to mark International Women's Day.\nChristine LaGarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, speaking at the same event said that promoting women's economic participation will reap huge growth dividends. An IMF study has estimated that half of women globally do not work, making them an under-utilised economic resource, and when they do work, they are underpaid and exploited.\nBy changing these dynamics, a country can raise its GDP by anywhere from 7 percent to 27 percent, depending on its starting point, LaGarde said. She cited recent initiatives by Japan to promote women in the workplace to help it overcome two decades of very slow growth and huge social costs of an aging population.\nKorea is crafting a similar programme, and finance ministers from the Group of 20 leading industrialised and developing countries - anxious to jump start sluggish world growth - adopted a work plan in February to increase and improve women's participation in the workplace, she said.\nThe IFC programme is investing $100 million in its new facility for women entrepreneurs, Goldman Sachs Foundation's 10,000 Women programme is adding $32 million and the IFC expects to garner $468 million from other private and public investors, it said.\nBritain could allow women in army close combat role from 2016\nKanaz gets out of car after practical driving lesson, Afgahanistan"

        "webpage": "From the July 17, 2013 issue of Credit Union Times Magazine \u2022 Subscribe! New Deadline Reveals Benefits, Traps of Obamacare Rules\nJuly 17, 2013 \u2022 Reprints On the surface, it might appear that a recent extension of the deadline for large employers to comply with providing health insurance under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act from 2014 to 2015, is a cause for relief. But some are not so sure.\nCredit Union Exchange Blueprint, a Birmingham, Ala.-based private exchange for credit unions and members that provides online access to insurance carriers, said it believes the decision to extend the compliance deadline for providing health insurance coverage to employees will cause more companies to drop their group coverage and send staffers to the individual market.\nEPL, the company in Birmingham, Ala., that provides the technology behind CUEB, said large employers will also hurt many of their employees by offering coverage, but they've been stuck between a rock and a hard place since they faced severe penalties of $2,000 per full-time worker if they failed to provide coverage.\n\"With that threat removed, large employers can now make their decision the same way small employers will-based on what's best for the employees,\" EPL said.\nOn July 2, the White House posted an announcement on its website saying that it would extend the deadline from 2014 to 2015 to allow employers with 50 or more employers to test the new reporting systems and make any necessary adaptations to their health benefits.\n\"This delay will give all of us enough time to work through the many issues and provisions that will be in effect for 2014 and beyond,\" said Sherry Campbell, benefits consultant and chief operating officer for CU Benefits Alliance, a Salem, Ore.-based CUSO owned by 18 credit unions. \"This delay will give us some relief in efforts to meet all the timelines of the legislation.\"\nPrior to the announcement of the extension, businesses with more than 50 workers that did not provide health care coverage faced paying fines of $2,000 per employee starting next year.\nCampbell said the federal government has realized the complexity of this particular provision and the reporting involved for compliance. \"So many times law makers do not understand the unintended consequences of passing new laws,\" Campbell said.\n\"And, they heard from so many mid-size and large groups that benefits are made available to most of their employees now, why place this requirement in front of them in 2014, when employers in this market already see the value of providing a robust benefit package,\" she questioned.\nAnother issue that has come up from the new PPACA deadline is the use of federal subsidies. Under the new law, low-income individuals and families above 100% and up to 400% of the federal poverty level will receive federal subsidies on a sliding scale if they choose to purchase insurance via an exchange. Those from 133% to 150% of the poverty level would be subsidized such that their premium cost would be 3% to 4% of income.\nOffering coverage that is affordable for employees blocks all related individuals, generally, the spouse and tax dependent children, from accessing a government subsidy, said Josh Hilgers, president of Health Partners America, a Birmingham, Ala.-based provider of coverage tools to insurance brokers that is working with CUEB. As it turns out, nearly two-thirds of U.S. households earn less than 400% of the federal poverty level, the cutoff point for the subsidies, according to the firm.\n\"And the bar hasn't been set very high,\" he offered. \"If the employee would not have to pay more than 9.5% of his household income for his portion of the single (employee-only) premium on the employer's plan, his entire family is firewalled off from getting the subsidy.\"\nEric Johnson, director of education for Health Partners America said the IRS has concluded that congressional intent was to block these individuals from obtaining the tax credits. Instead of basing the affordability determination on the cost of the family premium, he said they're basing it only on what the employee would pay, which means that coverage will be considered affordable for most employees and their family members will be locked into the employer's plan, even if it's significantly more expensive and the employer isn't contributing to the dependent premiums.\"\n\"It really doesn't make any sense,\" Johnson said.\nSome experts believe that, as employees learn how the tax credits work, they may ask their employers to stop offering health insurance altogether so that they can afford coverage for their families, according to EPL.\n\"When you look at the numbers, it's clear that most employees will do better with a subsidized plan,\" Hilgers said. \"That's because the amount a family would pay is limited to a percentage of its income. The less people make, or the more children they have, the more affordable the subsidized coverage becomes.\" Show Comments"

        "webpage": "Why the recovery is feeble\nWASHINGTON  -  - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke last week became the latest economist to ask why the current economic recovery has been so weak. The question has inspired a cottage industry of studies, papers and speeches with often-esoteric and murky theories. The explanation is actually straightforward: The financial crisis and Great Recession scared the wits out of most Americans -- not just consumers but also corporate managers, bankers and small-business owners. They are reacting accordingly. They're cautious, risk-averse and defensive. They're spending less and saving more.\nThe recovery's languor is striking. Bernanke, speaking to the New York Economic Club, noted that the economy's annual growth rate had averaged only about 2 percent since the recession officially ended in mid-2009. By contrast, the average growth rate of post-World War II recoveries at a similar stage is almost 4.5 percent. This means the economy is producing about $1.4 trillion less of everything, from Big Macs to cars, than it would if we'd had an average recovery. To be sure, the recession's severity stemmed from the housing bubble and the damage to homeowners and financial institutions. From the third quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2009, household wealth (net worth) fell $16 trillion, reflecting a collapse of home and stock prices. In the same period, the number of unemployed workers jumped by 6.4 million. People -- again, not merely consumers but also business managers, bankers and others -- were shell-shocked. To conserve cash, consumers curbed spending; businesses did likewise by canceling investment projects, firing and not hiring. But remember: This was more than three years ago. Typically after a recession hits bottom, there's a period of above-average growth. Excesses (too many houses or dot-com startups) are cured by fire sales or bankruptcies. Pent-up demand or government \"stimulus\" policies spur spending. Surviving businesses begin to hire to meet added sales. Confidence revives. Recoveries become self-sustaining. In today's recovery, this recuperation has been partial. One theory is that recessions accompanied by a financial crisis are harsher and longer. To repay debts, borrowers reduce spending. Facing bad loans, lenders lend less or go bankrupt. But again: Time has passed. Many adjustments have occurred. Household debt payments (interest plus principal) as a share of disposable income have dropped to 1993 levels, says the Fed. Banks have raised billions of capital to offset loan losses. Still, the recovery stumbles. The residue of fear and anxiety is far greater than after other postwar recessions, with the possible exception of the deep 1981-82 downturn. Bad things happened that were not supposed to happen. We were supposed to be immune from major financial crises or anything resembling the Great Depression. Economic progress -- the advance of knowledge and policymaking -- had cured us of these afflictions. Not so, it turns out. If the impossible happened once, it could happen again. Better to be cautious and prepared. This was the lesson. It's been reinforced by other events. Since late 2008, the federal government has run $5 trillion of deficits; the Federal Reserve has held short-term interest rates at near zero and has, through purchases of bonds, pumped more than $2 trillion into the economy. Economists argue whether more could have been done. But to typical Americans, these sums seem huge and have produced, at best, only modest benefits. The tools of economic control don't work so well. It's hard to avoid a sneaking suspicion that the people at the top don't know what they're doing. And then there's Europe. As Bernanke noted, its budgetary crisis was \"not anticipated.\" A decade ago, hardly anyone thought that advanced nations might default on their government debt. Now the possibility is openly discussed. Mark this as another instance of the \"impossible\" happening and confounding confidence. We have gone from \"irrational exuberance\" to chastened restraint. The first fueled borrowing and spending, while the second -- the past's costly surprises and the future's unknowns -- discourages the same. Companies have $1.7 trillion in spare cash, reflecting a reluctance to invest and to hire. The Fed's low interest rates and plunging home prices (down about a third nationally) might have triggered a strong housing revival. But that's been frustrated by lenders maintaining \"tight terms and conditions on mortgage loans, even for potential borrowers with relatively good credit,\" Bernanke complained. Consumer optimism has improved but remains at low levels. Savings rates could rise. All this affects policy. President Obama's anti-business rhetoric and the complexities of Obamacare may also have weakened confidence. But in the election, voters gave him a pass on the economy, blaming mainly his predecessor. Still, Obama knows he cannot escape responsibility forever. Avoiding the \"fiscal cliff\" and doing so in ways that build Americans' faith in the future serve almost everyone's interest. Psychology matters.

CKGSB, a leading business school with headquarters in Beijing and satellite campuses in Shanghai and Shenzhen, is China's first privately funded and faculty-governed business school. \"China has been totally globalized since Deng Xiao Ping's tour to the south in 1992,\" said Xiang, adding that the extent of China's globalization is underestimated by the West and by the Chinese themselves. One feature of China's economy is trade dependence. But \"while China is the largest export nation, the majority of exports are not done by Chinese companies,\" said Xiang. Foreign investing companies contributed more than 55 percent of exports from China. \"You have nothing like this in the U.S., U.K., Japan, or Germany. ...That's one [piece of] evidence of China's economy being more open than many others'.\" China's enormous amount of foreign reserves, extensive trading with many other countries, and number two ranking in foreign direct investment inflow constitute further evidence of China's openness, according to Xiang.\nXiang is very positive about China's future economic growth. The service sector in China only contributes 43 percent of GDP now, which indicates \"great potential for improvement,\" he said. China also has a large domestic market. \"The wealth creation in China is unbelievable,\" says Xiang, noting that China Life and China Mobile, two of the biggest companies in their respective industries in terms of capitalization, operate only domestically. In addition, the urbanization trend in China will drive demand in the country for at least 10 years.\nIn terms of crediting China's rapid economic growth, Xiang highlighted the great contribution the private sector has made to China's economy. Even excluding foreign companies, that contribution amounts to 71 percent of China's GDP. The private sector is responsible for 80 percent of China's jobs and creates 90 percent of new jobs.\nDespite the overall positive outlook, Xiang points out that the inequality of wealth distribution in China could be a serious problem. Another potential limitation is Chinese companies' low value capture. For example, Chinese companies only capture 1.3 percent of the retail value for the iPhone 4S. At the same time, China is paying an enormous price in terms of pollution and human sacrifice. \"China has been subsidizing the global living standard for many years,\" Xiang said. \"The products made in China are underpriced. The environmental costs are not fully captured. The model is not sustainable.\" And yet, he noted so much of the international perception is focused on the \"China threat.\" \"China is not doing a proper job of explaining itself,\" he concluded. \"Peace is essential for progress. China does not want conflict with anyone.\"  -  Yuezhou Huo '15 is an intern in Marketing and Communications at Johnson.\nNews Headlines Index\nJohnson Home\nAbout Cornell Enterprise Online\n\u00a9 2011 Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management"

U.S. Startups Fight SEC Over Fundraising Disclosures\nSEC proposal for advance disclosure runs counter to startups' less predictable fundraising efforts.\nBy Dave Michaels, Bloomberg September 23, 2013\nStartup companies that celebrated the passage of a U.S. law allowing them to solicit investors more more openly say regulators may undercut that move by requiring detailed disclosures of their fundraising.\nAn 80-year-old ban on advertising private investments ends today, allowing businesses to make public pitches to certain investors. At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing whether to require companies to file advance disclosures of those efforts. Failing to file could trigger a one-year disqualification from selling shares.\nStartups say the SEC's proposal was written with more established companies in mind. The cycle of fundraising at younger companies can be less predictable, relying on chance introductions and pitches at meetings of investors known as demo days.\n\"The market place is feeling a little unsure and insecure about how to move forward, particularly when they rely on venture fairs and demo days,\" said Catherine Mott, a Pittsburgh investor who formerly led the Angel Capital Association. \"This flies right in the face of the JOBS Act.\"\nThe JOBS Act, the acronym for the Jumpstart Our Business Startups law, passed Congress in 2012 with the goal of deregulating how emerging companies raise money. The law jettisoned advertising restrictions intended to help ensure small investors aren't lured into out-sized risks.\nFor the first time, companies raising money outside of a public offering will be able to advertise that they're seeking funding. The pool of eligible investors will remain restricted to only those considered sophisticated enough to evaluate the risk, or wealthy enough to absorb a loss. The SEC defines such \"accredited investors\" as having with annual income exceeding $200,000 or net worth of $1 million excluding a primary residence.\nPrivate offers are the biggest source of funding for small companies. The U.S. market for such securities was $903 billion last year, according to an SEC analysis published in July. The median amount raised was just $1.5 million.\nThe SEC voted in July to lift the advertising ban. At the same time, it proposed new rules intended to mitigate the risk of fraud created by allowing riskier ventures to solicit investors more directly.\nThe proposal would require companies publicizing their fundraising to file a form 15 days before seeking capital, a change from the current rule of that asks for the disclosure 15 days after of the first sale of shares. Any written advertising materials would have to be submitted to the SEC.\nThe form increases the amount of information companies must disclose, including additional details on how they will use the money. A company that fails to file the form could be banned from conducting a similar offering for a year.\n\"Basically, this is a booby trap, and lots"

Professors Robert J. Shiller of Yale University and Eugene F. Fama and Lars Peter Hansen, both of the University of Chicago, won \"for their empirical analysis of asset prices,\" the Royal Swedish Academy said in announcing the honor Monday. \"The Laureates have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices,\" the academy said. \"It relies in part on fluctuations in risk and risk attitudes, and in part on behavioral biases and market frictions.\" The economists' research spans decades, stretching back to the 1960s. They pursued their theories independent of one another, laying the groundwork for the rise of index funds and \"behavioral finance,\" which takes investors' motivations and limitations into account. Here's how the academy summarized their contributions: \"Eugene Fama and several collaborators demonstrated that stock prices are extremely difficult to predict in the short run, and that new information is very quickly incorporated into prices. These findings not only had a profound impact on subsequent research but also changed market practice. The emergence of so-called index funds in stock markets all over the world is a prominent example.\" \"Lars Peter Hansen developed a statistical method that is particularly well suited to testing rational theories of asset pricing. Using this method, Hansen and other researchers have found that modifications of these theories go a long way toward explaining asset prices.\" \"Robert Shiller ...found that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends, and that the ratio of prices to dividends tends to fall when it is high, and to increase when it is low. This pattern holds not only for stocks, but also for bonds and other assets.\" Fama, 74, began his work in the mid-1960s; as Bloomberg notes, he is often called the \"father of modern finance.\" In an interview with the academy conducted minutes after the phone call informing him of his win, Fama explained that he might not have embarked on his legendary career, if he hadn't lost his passion for studying French. \"In my junior year in college, I was getting kind of tired of French. So, I took an economics course, and I loved it,\" he said. \"The rest of my two years in college I spent in economics.\" In winning the Nobel, they will split a cash award of 8 million Swedish kroner, a bit more than $1.2 million.Copyright 2013 NPR.

        "webpage": "Fund of Information\nMoney-Market Compromise?\nMoney-market reform is in the hands of another set of regulators now, including Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Federal Reserve Chief Ben Bernanke. But it's Charles Schwab that's publicly changing the conversation.\nBeverly Goodman\nFund Scope | Scoreboard The debate over money-market reform has been one long, ugly slog, and it's far from over. But the conversation is changing. After the SEC failed to garner enough internal support to bring its proposal to a vote, its chairman and money-fund bogeyman, Mary Schapiro, essentially tossed the hot potato to the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Created by Dodd-Frank, FSOC (pronounced f-sock) is made up of representatives from all of the financial-regulatory bodies. Its proposal, announced Nov. 13, looks suspiciously like the SEC's, involving a floating net asset value and capital requirements. FSOC is headed by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, and Fed chief Ben Bernanke is a member; both have been vocal in backing money-fund reform. The fund industry's lobbying arm, the Investment Company Institute, immediately responded that the proposal \"failed to advance the debate over how to make money-market funds more resilient in the face of financial crisis\" and that \"ICI and its members continue to oppose these reform concepts.\" It's worth noting, however, that the FSOC's cross-agency heft does allow it to think - and act - a little more creatively than the SEC. For instance, the regulators acknowledged the problem of recording thousands of minuscule capital gains and losses that would be incurred as individuals and institutions wrote checks and moved funds around. Its solution: to direct the Internal Revenue Service to come up with a solution, allowing for \"administrative relief for both shareholders and fund sponsors\" in terms of calculating basis and other tax matters, like the wash-sale rule. But the \"let's get this done\" tone has been largely ignored. \"Money funds feel backed into a corner,\" says Pete Crane, publisher of the eponymous and ubiquitous Crane Data. \"For them, this is life or death.\" Enlarge Image\nThat is, until Charles Schwab - which has $155 billion in money-fund assets and had been ardent in its opposition to any money-fund reform - publicly called for compromise. CEO Walt Bettinger put forth the firm's proposal in an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal (published by Dow Jones, as is Barron's). \"The money-fund issue is indicative of the broader issues facing our country,\" Bettinger tells Barron's. \"Someone has to take a step forward.\" Schwab's proposal delineates the risks inherent in money funds: \"breaking the buck,\" when the net asset value falls below $1 per share, and a run, in which investors yank too much money out too quickly. Both risks, Bettinger says, are much higher in so-called prime money-market funds, which invest in a wide array of government, corporate, and international securities, than they are in money funds that invest exclusively in federal and state-government notes. The latter funds, according to Schwab, should be left alone, while prime funds should be regulated, according to how much institutional money they hold, since it's institutions that are most likely to react quickly and cause a run. Treating prime funds differently than government-only funds is legitimate and shouldn't be hard to implement. Distinguishing between institutional and retail money is trickier, as even Schwab acknowledges. The proposal is light on details, which has emboldened some critics to note that Schwab has very little in the way of institutional money, compared with money-fund kingpins JPMorgan, Federated, Fidelity, and others. Bettinger bristles at the notion that his proposal would be less onerous for Schwab than for other firms. \"That's a complete smoke screen, put out by someone who wants to discredit our compromise,\" he says, adding that almost half ($762 billion) of Schwab's $1.9 trillion in assets are managed by registered investment advisors, who manage their clients' money en masse. \"If there's a problem, an RIA isn't going to move just one customer's money; he's going to move all $100 million that he has power of attorney over,\" Bettinger says. \"That would likely fall under the definition of institutional money.\" E-mail:  Email\nLatest in Fund of Information 1.

(MarketWatch)  -  Should you use the stock market's turmoil as the occasion to get a jumpstart on the much-vaunted \"Sell in May and Go Away\" indicator? \"Yes\" is the answer from one of the two advisers I monitor who not only follow this indicator, but try to do even better by selling in April rather than always waiting until May Day. And the other is poised to give a \"sell\" signal as early as this coming Monday. This seasonal pattern, also known as the Halloween Indicator, refers to the stock market's tendency to turn in its best performances between Halloween and May Day (the \"winter\" months) and to produce mediocre returns, at best, the other six months of the year (the \"summer\" months). Since the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -3.39%\nwas created in 1896, the market has produced a 5.2% annualized return during the winter months and 1.7% in the summer. How to speak to aging parents about money(2:38)\nTo be sure, these are averages, and the seasonal tendency doesn't work every year. The summer months in 2013 were one such exception, when the Dow rose 4.8% between May Day and Halloween. But it works enough of the time to be significant at the 95% confidence level that statisticians often use to decide whether a pattern is more than just a fluke. Another impressive statistical feat achieved by the Halloween Indicator: It's become even more pronounced in recent decades. That's noteworthy, because the more usual pattern is for tendencies to stop working once they are discovered and lots of investors begin to follow them. But not in this case. Ben Jacobsen, a finance professor at Massey University in New Zealand, says he found an article as long ago as 1935 in the Financial Times in which the \"sell in May\" pattern is referred to as something that was already well-known and followed. Even though the pattern nearly 80 years ago already had a solid historical foundation, Jacobsen says that, since then, the difference between the average returns in winter and summer has become even bigger. Given this impressive record, the odds would seem to be quite low of being able to do even better by exiting and entering the market during April and October rather than automatically waiting until May Day and Halloween. Stock-market timers in general have very poor success rates, rarely doing better over the long term than simply buying and holding. Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. And over the past 12 years, one of the two market-timing services that I monitor that regularly second-guess the \"Sell in May and Go Away\" system  -  Sy Harding's Street Smart Report, edited by Sy Harding  -  has significantly increased that seasonal pattern's performance. While the other one  -  Almanac Investor Newsletter, edited by Jeffrey Hirsch  -  has not improved on the Halloween Indicator, it at least has still beaten a buy-and-hold strategy. Both advisers pursue surprisingly similar modifications to this basic seasonal pattern: Each relies on a technical indicator known as MACD to pinpoint the precise day on which they enter and exit the market. (MACD is a short-term momentum indicator, standing for moving average convergence divergence.) Annualized Gain Risk reduction relative to overall stock market Sharpe Ratio Buy & Hold 7.7% 0% 0.13 Mechcanical version of Halloween Indicator 7.9% 38% 0.20 Almanac Investor variant of Halloween Indicator 7.9% 36% 0.13 Sy Harding variant of Halloween Indicator 9.2% 39% 0.24 The Hulbert Financial Digest data in the accompanying table was calculated assuming these advisers earned the return of the Wilshire 5000 Index when on a \"buy\" signal, and otherwise the 90-day Treasury bill rate. The Almanac Investor's Hirsch is the one adviser of this pair who is already on a \"sell\" signal, which he issued the evening of April 7. The particular rules Harding follows say that the earliest date on which he could get a \"sell\" signal is this coming Monday, and only then if the MACD is on a \"sell\" signal on that date. To be sure, you shouldn't even consider selling in May and going away if you're investing in a taxable account, since you will have to pay taxes on the capital gains you realize when selling. But if you're investing in a tax-deferred account, both of these advisers will soon be in agreement that you may want to consider going to cash and thereby take the rest of the spring and summer off from stressing about the stock market.

By Chris Isidore, senior writerNovember 3, 2010: 11:18 AM ETNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The economy was a Democrat's worst enemy in this year's midterm elections. Will President Obama face the same fate in 2012?Political scientists say the direction of the economy is what colors an incumbent's re-election chances most. And even though sluggish growth is widely expected to continue next year, economists are generally forecasting better growth, and improvements in the job market in 2012. That could well be enough to save Obama's job. Email\nWhat effect will the 2010 midterm election have on the economy?\nImprove it\nMake it worse\nNo impact\n\"The next two years will be more important for [Obama's] prospects than the first half of his first term,\" said Douglas Hibbs, a retired professor at the University of Gothenburg who has studied the impact of the economy on voter choices over the last 60 years.Unemployment currently stands at 9.6%, just a pinch below the 10.1% peak hit last October. Economists surveyed by CNNMoney.com expect unemployment will still be barely over 9% a year from now. But the long-term outlook is rosier -- overall, they forecast unemployment to drop to about 8.1% on Election Day 2012, with some predicting it'll drop as low as 7% by then.That kind of improvement could lift income enough to make Obama a winner, said Hibbs. His model to predict elections focuses on average growth rates in personal income rather than political polls. It has proven very accurate in elections since 1954. And he said gains in employment would almost certainly bring about the kind of significant gain in per capita income that could help the incumbent.\"If we get into a jobs recovery, the American economy is capable of extraordinary growth rates,\" Hibbs said.See full survey resultsObama wouldn't be the first president to ride the improving job market wave. During the 1982 recession, unemployment peaked at 10.8%. A year later it fell to 8.5%, and by Election Day 1984, it was down to 7.4%, allowing Reagan to run his now-famous \"Morning in America\" commercials hyping a more optimistic outlook for the economy. The aggressive campaign was a success, and Reagan was re-elected in a landslide victory.But the economy doesn't necessarily need to be strong to get the president re-elected, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. It just needs to improve enough to not be considered weak.0:00\n/2:25It's the economy! (Again)\"Right now all incumbents are being hammered by the bad economy,\" said Zandi. \"Two years from now, if we're at 8% unemployment, it'll be moving fast enough in the right direction to not be the major issue.\"But while improvement in income and employment is important, other economic issues could impact the next election -- namely voters' view of their own net worth and the value of their homes, said Mark Peterson, a professor of public policy at UCLA.\"When people perceive the whole system is doing better, if we return to a period where housing is rebounding and foreclosures are down and there's a sense of turning a corner, that's the kind of thing that Reagan was able to tap into,\" said Peterson.If the true test will be in the court of public opinion, the president could be facing an uphill battle, said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist for the Potomac Research Group. While economists proclaim a \"recovery,\" real people are still hurting. If that doesn't change before November 2012, Obama could be in trouble.\"I'm not sure you can make the case in the next two years that the public will perceive a clear recovery,\" said Valliere.

He tweeted: \"The worst part of today's jobs report? It provides just enough inane talking points for both sides of politics.\" Of course, that could probably be said most first Fridays of the month during a general-election year when Democrats and Republicans try to extract any advantage they can from the latest employment report from the U.S. Labor Department. In any event, what is or isn't considered inane is typically in the eyes of the partisan beholder. What isn't in dispute is that the party in power always tries to focus voter attention on whatever part of the report that can be seen as the half-full glass while the out of power party always points out the half-empty glass. The report showed the economy adding the fewest jobs  -  115,000  -  since October. It also indicated that the percentage of people of working age who were actually working or seeking employment fell to its lowest point since 1981. That helps explain why the unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent. Still, Obama and others in his White House stressed the positive, as you'd expect, since the greatest threat to his re-election would be the widespread perception that he doesn't have the cure for what ails the economy. At an appearance at Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, VA Friday morning, Obama said: \"After the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have created more than 4.2 million new jobs over the last 26 months. More than one million jobs in the last six months alone. So that's the good news. But there are still a lot of folks out of work which means that we've got to do more. If we're going to recover all the jobs that were lost during the recession, and if we're going to build a secure economy that strengthens the middle class, than we're going to have to do more...\" Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, interpreted the report as yet one more signal failure to lay at Obama's feet and another reason why he and not the Democratic president should be in the White House. On Fox News he said: \"Well, we should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month. This is way, way, way off from what should happen in a normal recovery. The reason that you're seeing the unemployment rate go down is because you have more people dropping out of the workforce than you have getting jobs. It's a terrible and very disappointing report this morning. Clearly the American people are wondering why this recovery isn't happening faster, why it's taking years and years for the recovery to occur and we seem to be slowing down, not speeding up. This is not progress, this is very, very disappointing and a lot of American people are having hard times and this is not good news this morning.\" Actually, most economists would be ecstatic if the economy started to create 250,000 jobs a month, or half the number Romney cited. That's especially true since the Great Recession wasn't your father's typical business-cycle recession but contractions caused by a financial crisis of the type that hit in 2007 generally take much longer to recover from, according to experts like Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff in their book \"This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\" If there continues to be an irony in the how the jobs situation is playing out, it's that Obama, who embodies his party's general warmth to government workers compared with Republicans, has presided over a particularly bad period for those employees. On his watch, they have seen the number of government jobs shrink significantly while private-sector jobs have expanded. Matter of fact, one of the biggest wet blankets on the economy has been job losses at the state and city levels as recession-strapped governments have thrown teachers and other public workers overboard. The Washington Post recently examined the situation and how it has militated against Obama's efforts to boost the overall economy. The trend continued in April, with governments cutting 13,000 jobs during the month, bringing the total government jobs lost since Obama became president in January 2009 to 607,000. As the Post story reports, many government job cuts would've likely happened sooner, and there would have been more of them, without the stimulus money Obama and Congress directed to the states in 2009 as part of the American Recovery Act. The president was able to get some additional aid to states and locals approved by Congress but not as much as he had thought necessary.Copyright 2012 National Public Radio. To see more, visit .

        "webpage": "Eliot Spitzer agrees with those criticisms - to a point. \"There is some legitimacy to the notion that insider-trading cases do not confront the structural problems that undergird the most significant cancers that metastasized on the Street prior to '08 - the conflicts of interest woven into the business models of the major banks,\" he told me. Few regulators and prosecutors understood Wall Street from the inside out the way that Spitzer did. As New York attorney general, he went after the knots of conflicts after the dotcom bust, making Wall Street banks settle and change their research practices, nailing big mutual funds for abusive trading, and pushing the giant insurer AIG to remove its CEO.\nBut Spitzer doesn't buy into the popular progressive critique that the insider-trading prosecutions have been a sideshow. \"Having said that, [the prosecutors] deserve an awful lot of credit for having pursued insider trading in the very determined way that they have,\" said the former New York governor and current Viewpoints host. \"It is an area of fraud that has always been there, and probably will always be there, because the temptations are there.\" What's more, he notes, \"They haven't just gotten small fish, they got big players.\" For example, the U.S. government has won convictions of a ring involving Raj Rajaratnam, the former billionaire head of the hedge fund Galleon Group, and Rajat Gupta, the former head of McKinsey & Co. and a Goldman Sachs board member. And now it is pursuing hedge-fund giant SAC Capital.\nThe problem for prosecutors is that the sins of the financial crisis were very difficult to pin on the head honchos as crimes. \"The issue of corporate remedies is the most difficult and the most challenging issue we have to deal with in this whole mess,\" he said. \"Finding and ascribing criminal intent to a CEO is rarely going to happen.\" Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein, he notes, wasn't directly involved in the Abacus transaction - a collateralized-debt obligation (CDO) deal gone bad that led to a $550 million settlement. \"You'd never see an email where the CEO talks about doing that deal. This isn't how business is being done.\" And so in many cases, the best that prosecutors can hope for is a settlement, in which companies pay penalties and neither deny nor admit their guilt. In the meantime, the CEOs stay on.\nIn the 80s, the Securities and Exchange Commission took the lead in prosecuting insider trading. A decade ago, it was Spitzer's New York attorney general's office that went after big Wall Street firms. Now the prosecutorial energy is coming from Preet Bharara, the ambitious U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\nThe case developing against SAC is another sign of Bharara's ambition. Last week, the government charged (PDF) Mathew Martoma, a junior executive at the huge hedge-fund complex, with trading on insider information gleaned from a doctor who helped oversee drug trials. Having secured the cooperation of the doctor, the government is aggressively pursuing Martoma. And on Wednesday, SAC told investors it has received a Wells notice - a formal notification from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it plans to pursue the company.\nIt seems Steven Cohen either has remarkably bad judgment choosing employees, or he has set up an environment in which some people feel compelled or welcome to cheat.To a degree, Steven Cohen may be an irresistible target for prosecutors. It seems he either has remarkably bad judgment choosing employees, or he has set up an environment in which some people feel compelled or welcome to cheat. Even though he has yet to be directly implicated in any wrongdoing, the government has busted several people for insider trading who were either former SAC employees or SAC employees at the time of their alleged wrongdoing. For all intents and purposes, however, Cohen is SAC. He owns most of the capital SAC manages and makes all the key decisions. \"He's like the John Gotti of the hedge-fund world,\" Spitzer notes, taking pains not to compare hedge funds with organized crime. In a prior generation, government prosecutors would put charts on the wall to identify the five organized-crime families"

The bank agreed to compensate borrowers who were steered into higher-priced loans or whose income was exaggerated.\nThe Fed said a unit of Wells Fargo inflated borrowers' incomes on loan documents to qualify for mortgages they otherwise couldn't afford from 2004 until 2008. Sales personnel also pushed borrowers toward higher-interest, subprime loans, even though they were eligible for lower-interest mortgages, the central bank said.\nSeparately, Wells Fargo is fighting a lawsuit by the City of Baltimore, which accuses it of targeting residents of Baltimore's predominantly African-American neighborhoods for disadvantageous loans. The city has claimed that the bank steered black borrowers who qualified for prime loans into more onerous subprime loans and targeted unqualified homeowners for refinance or home equity loans that caused them to lose their houses. As a result of the foreclosures, the city claims it suffered reduced property tax revenue and increased demand for municipal services, such as fire department and police assistance.\nIt took more than three years and three major edits, but in April, the city's first-of-its-kind suit survived a defense motion to dismiss the case. A hearing on how discovery will proceed is scheduled for Aug. 10.\nA bank spokeswoman said she does not expect Wednesday's settlement to have any impact on the Baltimore case.\n\"This agreement with the Federal Reserve doesn't include any mention, any allegation that lending practice had any disparate impact on racial minorities,\" Mary Eshet, the spokeswoman said, distinguishing it from the city's reverse-redlining lawsuit. \"They're two very different, distinct situations.\"\nBetween 3,700 and roughly 10,000 people could be compensated under the $85 million settlement, the Fed said. The payments will likely range from $1,000 to $20,000.\nThe loans were issued by Wells Fargo Financial Inc., a subsidiary of the bank that closed in July 2010, the bank said.\n\"The alleged actions committed by a relatively small group of team members are not what we stand for at Wells Fargo,\" said Chairman and CEO John Stumpf in a statement. The bank has already paid restitution to about 600 customers, it said.\nThe alleged actions by Wells Fargo are similar to accusations made against many subprime lenders during the housing boom. Hundreds of those smaller lenders went bankrupt when the housing market collapsed in 2007.\nMillions of homeowners who took on subprime loans during the housing boom have since lost their homes to foreclosure.\nAttorneys general in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are jointly investigating whether lenders cut corners and improperly handled hundreds of thousands of foreclosure cases over the past several years.\nMany lenders, including Bank of America, temporarily halted their foreclosure cases in October after allegations surfaced that employees signed but didn't read documents that may have contained errors.\nWells Fargo also admitted it had made mistakes in thousands of foreclosure cases and promised to fix them. But it did not stop its foreclosures.\nBoth lenders say they're fixing the problems.\nIn April, more than a dozen lenders and servicers singled out by the Federal Reserve were ordered to hire independent auditors to figure how many homeowners may have been improperly foreclosed upon in 2009 and 2010. As part of agreements, the financial firms will \"remediate all financial injury to borrowers caused by any errors, misrepresentations, or other deficiencies.\"\nFederal regulators and state attorneys general are meeting with banks to try and strike a settlement that will significantly change the mortgage industry, forcing lenders to modify more mortgages and provide greater protections for borrowers. A final agreement is not expected for several months.\nThe Daily Record's Brendan Kearney contributed to this article.\nShare  +1 borrowers federal reserve higher interest rates loan documents mortgage mortgage abuse subprime mortgages washington wells fargo wells fargo & co 3:30 pm Wed, July 20, 2011\nPrevious: Blistering heat wave stressing nation's power grid\nNext: Eagle Bancorp gets $56.6M investment from U.S. Treasury"

Costs of a Floating NAV\nThe SEC's proposed change to money-market funds would cost an estimated $4.8 billion over 10 years. How much of that burden would fall on your business?\nBy Meg Waters August 28, 2013 \u2022 Reprints\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently considering a proposal that would require institutional investors to account for their holdings in prime money-market funds - those that invest in short-term corporate debt - using a variable net asset value (NAV), rather than the stable NAV that is currently the industry standard. The proposal was announced in June, and the deadline for comments is September 17.\nThe goal would be to increase transparency, in order to avoid a run on money funds in future financial crises like the run that occurred in September 2008 when the Reserve Primary Fund \"broke the buck,\" repricing shares below $1 to devalue investors' holdings. Critics of constant NAV money funds argue that their constant $1 price masks movement in the market and that if they're going to promise liquidity on par with bank accounts, they should be regulated like banks. The problem is that what may seem like a fairly minor accounting change could have a major impact on corporate usage of money funds.\nConsulting firm Treasury Strategies conducted a study for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that pins a dollar figure on the impact to institutional investors of a move to a floating NAV for money-market funds: between $1.8 billion and $2 billion up front, then another $270 million to $280 million per year. Treasury Strategies came to these numbers by analyzing the effects of the change on investors in an array of different categories, including corporations of all sizes and public institutions such as municipalities and universities. \"We applied a lot of different cost components and then generated a very conservative estimate,\" says Steve Wiley, a manager with Treasury Strategies.\nThe study identified seven areas in which corporate investors would incur significant costs if they continued using prime money funds under the new proposal:\nInvestment policy development. Many companies' current investment policies include language that would prohibit investment in a floating NAV money-market fund. Although money funds' prices might hover around $1 per share, the SEC proposal envisions rounding to four decimal places, so prices might swing frequently. To continue using money funds, organizations might have to rewrite their investment policies to take into account mark-to-market valuations in calculating parameters for NAV fluctuations and acceptable levels of counterparty risk in money fund investments, as well as to ensure that their money fund accounting meets GAAP requirements.\n\"You'll need to establish acceptable net asset value parameters within investment policies, or else say that a prime money-market fund is no longer acceptable,\" Wiley says. \"You'll have to go through the process of having the board and senior executives review and approve that policy. Then there's another dynamic. An institutional investor's counterparty risk policy specifies the total amount of exposure across all financial instruments - credit facilities, bank balances, investments, derivatives - that you're willing to accept with a particular counterparty. That will have to change a little bit as well, to factor in the mark-to-market position for the company's money-market funds.\"\nInvestment process reengineering. Today, processes for initiating and redeeming holdings in money-market funds are usually as simple as transferring funds between accounts. Treasury Strategies anticipates that if money funds moved to a floating NAV, companies would have to take the extra step, before every initiation, of verifying that the investment instrument is acceptable at its current net asset value. This step would need to be taken during automatic sweeping of funds into money-market accounts, which would obviously complicate that process, possibly requiring automatic sweeps to involve a great deal more manual intervention.\n\"Companies will have to put in place a confirmation process,\" predicts Paul LaRock, a Treasury Strategies principal. \"Right now, when you buy or sell a money-market share, you know the price: It's a dollar. With the floating NAV, the price will vary slightly up and down around a dollar. Buyers and sellers will have to confirm with each other the exact purchase price, out four digits right of the decimal, just like when they trade ultrashort bond funds or equities. That will require a formal confirmation process to be put in place. To the extent that a buyer and a seller have slightly different prices on a trade, there will have to be an exception resolution process to mitigate those problems, and that will require staffing. When they don't match, people will have to get on the phone and fix it.\""

        "webpage": "Encyclopedia > Social Sciences and the Law > Economics, Business, and Labor > Economics: Terms and Concepts production\nproduction, in economics, all those activities that have to do with the creation of commodities, by imparting to raw materials utility, added value, or the ability to satisfy human wants. The farmer who grows wheat, the miller who grinds the wheat into flour, and the baker who transforms flour into bread are examples of producers who, each in his own way, impart utility to a natural or partially processed material. Production was the major thrust of industry until at least the beginning of the 20th cent., when sales and marketing began to be considered equally important in the transference of commodities from producers to consumers. Today, the prevailing mode of production is called mass production, with cottage industry accounting for only a minor portion of the market in most areas of the world. Many historians place the beginnings of mass production around 1800, with Eli Whitney's firearms factory approximating the labor process of modern industrial production. The mass production method, generally involving the piecing together of standardized, interchangeable parts by a number of workers, reached its apex in the automobile manufacturing of the early 20th cent. Increasing automation, with attendant increases in the division of labor, allowed manufacturers to hire unskilled or semiskilled labor, which would repeatedly perform small tasks in the ultimate production of a commodity. Hence, mass production often took the form of an assembly line, in which a continuous flow of products moves steadily forward toward completion. For most kinds of production in modern society, large amounts of capital in the form of machinery are required. Equally essential are land and its natural resources, from which the raw materials are obtained, and labor, which, with the aid of capital, extracts and transforms the raw materials. To these three primary factors of production is sometimes added a fourth: the entrepreneur who organizes the forces of production and assumes the risks. Since under capitalism production is for a market, an important function of the entrepreneur is to anticipate as accurately as possible the economic demands for goods and to produce the kind and quantity of goods that will meet that demand. In order to meet the great expenses of mass production, particularly the capital necessary in most industries, groups of speculators often take on the risks of production, and the individual entrepreneur has become less significant. Another late 20th-century trend has been toward greater computerization of the production process; increasingly, computers are not only being integrated into the machinery of production but are replacing much of the human labor as well. Computerization has made assembly lines faster and more accurate and has given them more flexibility. Through computerized instructions, the design and manufacture of many mass-produced products can easily be modified to suit the needs of the individual customer.

        "webpage": "Unreported Foreign Accounts - \"Should I Just Close The Account And Hope I Don't Get Caught?\"\n\n\"Should I just close my foreign account and hope I don't get caught?\" We frequently get asked this question. With the penalties so high for unreported offshore accounts, many taxpayers are tempted to simply close the account and transfer their money back to the United States. That may sound like a great plan but it isn't.\n\nBy now, anyone who reads this blog knows that foreign financial accounts must be reported annually to the IRS. Qualifying accounts include bank accounts, foreign hedge funds, brokerage accounts, CD's and even some insurance products. Those required to file include all U.S. taxpayers as well as Americans living abroad, dual nationals, American students living abroad and green card holders. (If you wish to read more information about offshore reporting, simply use our search engine in the upper right corner of our blog, Due Diligence. Terms such as FBAR, FATCA, OVDI and offshore reporting will bring you hundreds of informative articles we have written.)\n\nForeign accounts are reported annually on a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). The penalties for not filing an FBAR range from a low of $10,000 per account for negligent violations to 5 years in prison and $100,000 or more per account per year if the failure to report was intentional. The current IRS amnesty program, called the 2012 Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program or \"OVDP\" calls for a one time 27.5% penalty. (There are lower penalties for some taxpayers - consult with an experienced tax attorney to see if you qualify.)\n\nWith such high penalties, it is easy to see why so many taxpayers simply want to quietly close their foreign accounts and bring home their cash. Unfortunately, such a plan is fraught with peril.\n\nFirst, the U.S. Treasury has signed tax exchange agreements with many foreign governments. More are being added every year. These agreements allow the government to seek account records from foreign banks. Often the government seeks records going back several years. That means closing your account today doesn't necessarily mean that your account won't be discovered. Generally the IRS can only look back 6 years but there is some recent case law that suggests there is no statute of limitations for unreported foreign accounts.\n\nNext, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) will soon require foreign financial institutions to report account holders with ties to the United States. Even if your account is held in the name of a foreign trust or entity, your bank will soon be required to investigate and ascertain who holds the beneficial ownership in the account. Obviously, some folks will slip between the account but the hundreds of thousands who are identified will face huge penalties.\n\nIf these are not not enough good reasons to not avoid reporting, the IRS plans to have banks retroactively identify Americans who recently closed or moved their account.\n\nMoving your account in anticipate of the new FATCA rules could also be interpreted as evidence of your guilt.\n\nWhile some folks think they can simply bring back their offshore funds, others wonder if they can quietly late file an FBAR form for this year and ignore the prior years. The IRS calls this a \"quiet disclosure\". This too is fraught with peril.\n\nThe IRS has specifically warned taxpayers about trying the quiet disclosure route. If you are asked or questioned about how long you owned your foreign account and lie, the penalties include prison. In other words, your problems can quickly escalate.\n\nThe best advice we offer is coming clean with the IRS. If you deliberately hid or concealed money offshore, the amnesty program offers you a way to avoid prosecution and greatly reduce your penalties. If your failure to report was truly innocent, consider having your attorney \"opt out\" of amnesty. There are no guarantees once outside of amnesty but for those who can demonstrate that their failure to report was a mistake or for those who relied on bad tax advice, a traditional disclosure may be the best bet. in some cases, the IRS can waive all penalties and just give you a warning.\n\nThe tax lawyers at Mahany & Ertl have helped many taxpayers with offshore accounts. We can help you decide what option is best for you and minimize any penalties you may be facing. Most importantly, we can eliminate the anxiety and need to look over your shoulder for months and years.\n\nFor more information, contact attorney Bethany Kroes at *protected email* or by telephone at (414) 223-0464.

Bennett, CNN Contributor\nWilliam Bennett: National debt doesn't look like a priority for President Obama\nBennett: Obama more concerned with his legacy rather than our economic well-being He asks why the president is so unwilling to cut the size and scope of government\nBennett: GOP should make it clear that it will fulfill our debt obligations in a responsible way Editor's note: William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of \"The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood.\" He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush.\n(CNN) -- Second terms, untainted by re-election posturing, often reveal a president's true governing philosophy. In the case of President Obama, two recent revelations have confirmed all we may need to know about his agenda for the next four years.\nOn December 30, the president sat down for an interview with David Gregory on \"Meet the Press.\" Gregory asked the president, \"So what is your single priority of the second term? What is the equivalent to health care?\"\nPresident Obama replied, \"Well, there are a couple of things that we need to get done. I've said that fixing our broken immigration system is a top priority. I will introduce legislation in the first year to get that done.\" He went on to say, \"The second thing that we've got to do is to stabilize the economy and make sure it's growing.\"\nDuring his first term in office, coming off \"the worst recession since the Great Depression,\" to use the president's own words, it appeared to many that he prioritized Obamacare over the economy. Now it appears that the economy, and all that goes along with it, like the ever-growing national debt, will again play second fiddle, this time to immigration reform.\nIf priorities are any reflection of politics, it appears the president is more concerned with what he regards as historic, landmark legislation to build his legacy, rather than the economic well-being of the nation. If that seems like a harsh assessment, consider that just this week we learned from Stephen Moore's interview of House Speaker John Boehner in the Wall Street Journal that the president told Boehner during the fiscal cliff negotiations, \"We don't have a spending problem.\"\nIf $16 trillion of national debt and the huge deficits each year aren't spending problems, then what is? The United States most certainly has a spending problem. For the president to insist otherwise is dumbfounding but at the same time entirely consistent with his policies.\nHe called for the Simpson-Bowles Commission on deficit reduction, but ignored their recommendations. He campaigned ad nauseam about the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but the latest fiscal cliff deal is almost entirely tax hikes and even includes more stimulus spending. The only spending cuts he agreed to, the sequestration cuts, he had announced during one of the presidential debates \"will not happen.\"\nDems push for $1 trillion tax revenue\nThere seems to be a near invincible unwillingness by this president and his advisors to cut the size and scope of government. How then do conservatives negotiate the coming debt ceiling extension, especially when they control neither the White House nor the Senate?\nThere is no easy answer, but perhaps they should begin by explaining to the American people \"the politics of reality,\" as William Buckley aptly defined conservatism.\nThe recent elections seem to indicate that a majority of the American people want lower taxes for themselves but approve of the president's increased spending programs. In the end, they cannot have both. A vibrant and prosperous private sector cannot coexist with a one-size-fits-all caretaker state. One relies on low taxes and limited government interference, the other on high taxes and government redistribution of resources.\nSo Americans must choose between the two and conservatives must make that choice clear: higher taxes, higher spending and more government services, or opportunity and upward mobility with lower taxes and less government interference.\nThe debt ceiling is just the first of many opportunities to bring this choice to the public. Republicans should make it clear that they will fulfill our debt obligations in a responsible manner, but they will only give the president short-term debt ceiling extensions until we get this problem under control. If Obama doesn't want to cut spending in a meaningful way he's going to have to explain that to the American people every couple of months for the next four years.\nThe purpose isn't to thrash the president and his party or be ideological shock troops, as Ronald Reagan once warned against, but to hold a national education seminar on fiscal responsibility. Republicans have not won the argument, and will not win it, when these fiscal deals are made behind closed doors before the strike of midnight.\nSunlight is the best disinfectant and so too in politics. Republicans can win the argument by making a clear and cogent public articulation of the president's spending problem and how the American people, especially the lower and middle classes, will be the ones to suffer as a result.\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J.

        "webpage": "Business | National / World Business Holiday shopping is expected to be up ... unless\nBy ANNE D\ufffdINNOCENZIOThe Associated Press | October 04,2013\nNEW YORK \ufffd Americans, who are increasingly optimistic about improving economic conditions, are expected to spend at a more rapid clip during the upcoming holiday shopping season than they did last year. But that could change if the partial government shutdown that has forced about 800,000 federal workers off the job continues and causes shoppers to lose confidence in the economy.The National Retail Federation, the nation\ufffds largest retail trade group, is expected to release Thursday a forecast that sales in November and December will rise 3.9 percent to $602.1 billion. That\ufffds above the 3.5 percent increase a year ago and the 10-year average in holiday sales growth of 3.3 percent.But Matthew Shay, the group\ufffds president and CEO, said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday that the forecast was calculated before the government shut down after Congress failed to pass a spending bill by Monday\ufffds midnight deadline. In addition to the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers, that resulted in the shuttering of national parks and halting of a range of government services. Shay said the group\ufffds forecast does not account for the possibility that the shutdown, now in its third day, could go on for a prolonged period of time that he defines as two weeks or more. But it does factor in the optimism Americans feel as jobs have become easier to get and the housing recovery has gained momentum. \ufffdWhat we are trying to balance here is the underlying fundamentals with the economy, which seem strong, against all that consumer unease and the uncertainty coming from Washington,\ufffd Shay said.Shay acknowledges that predicting how the holiday season will fare is difficult. In fact, the National Retail Federation has often been either too cautious or too optimistic. Last year, for instance, the group\ufffds forecast of 4.1 percent increase was far higher than the 3.5 percent rise retailers actually saw. But the forecast nonetheless is an important indicator for retailers who rely on the last two months of the year for 20 percent to 40 percent of their annual sales. The estimates also provide insight for economists into consumer spending, which accounts for up to 70 percent of economic activity.A big concern is that a prolonged government shutdown could severely hurt the economy and necessarily, consumer spending. For each week the government remains shut, the U.S. economy would lose 0.15 percent of annualized growth, estimates David Stockton, a former research director at the Federal Reserve who is now at the Peterson Institute. And even before the government shutdown, retailers had reasons to be cautiously optimistic. While the job and housing markets are improving, that hasn\ufffdt yet translated into sustained spending increases among most shoppers. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other low-priced chains say that customers continue to struggle with a 2 percentage-point increase in the Social Security payroll tax that started on Jan. 1. Those worries hurt stores\ufffd sales during the back-to-school shopping season, the second largest shopping period behind the winter holidays. And a slew of retailers lowered their expectations for the rest of the year.An extended government shutdown would only further threaten holiday sales, but it wouldn\ufffdt be the first time the government\ufffds actions have had that impact. Last year, many Americans were worried about tense negotiations to resolve the fiscal cliff, a simultaneous increase in tax rates and a decrease in government spending. Congress and the White House reached a deal on Jan. 1 that prevented income taxes from rising for most households, but many store executives blamed the uncertainty during the height of holiday shopping for a slowdown in sales in late December.Unlike that battle last year, Shay, with the National Retail Federation, said he expects the government shutdown to be over well before the official kickoff to the holiday period on the day after Thanksgiving. \ufffdWe are optimistic that it could get resolved,\ufffd he said. \ufffdBut we still have to be realistic.\ufffd"

By\nNa'ama Sheffi |\nMar. 22, 2009 | 2:15 AM\nA specter is haunting the Israeli free market: How should the government respond to declining tax revenues and rising unemployment? It is not a simple math problem, but rather an issue that affects people's lives. All the options are difficult, but only a few of them will also help protect the fabric, humanity and morality of Israeli society. Bank of Israel governor Stanley Fischer has opted for the go-for-broke approach that worked in the U.S. during the Great Depression: Massive government investment in infrastructure aimed at jump-starting the economy. Although one can question whether an economic panacea that worked 70 years ago will work in the 21st century, it is clear that such a measure will help reduce unemployment and prevent a moral collapse of society. However, some prefer an ostensibly easier solution: Last week TheMarker revealed that the treasury has put forward a shocking proposal that would target specific parts of the economy. In its sights is the soft underbelly of Israeli society, including physicians and educators. No doubt, we shall regret harming these vital professions long after prosperity returns. Schoolteachers, university lecturers and physicians make a decent living, no more. Those who choose to pursue these professions rather than the private sector are idealists who seek to educate future generations, to heal the sick and to improve society as a whole. Cutbacks will sentence them to the same fate as other important and doomed sectors of society. Dozens of state-employed psychologists will soon be dismissed, along with art teachers and driving instructors, whose professions the Ministry of Education has deemed nonessential. It's more than a mere mathematical equation. It's a question of what Israeli society decides is important. Obviously, the deep recession demands serious cutbacks. But is instruction in schools a luxury? Is higher education \"fat\" in the budget? Is adequate medical care something that can be pared to the bone and even beyond? Idealists or not, doctors will soon find jobs in the private sector or abroad. Lecturers, especially those in practical fields, will find similar solutions. Good teachers will offer their services on the \"gray market\" - where parents fund teaching hours outside the school's budget - or focus on private tutoring. The long-term harm is plain to see. Less education means less development once the economy stabilizes. Less health care means the disadvantaged will have to pay huge costs for years to come. Then there's the short-term damage: Students whose parents are unemployed or in financial distress will not get assistance from the shrunken welfare system. Who will help expand their horizons? Certainly not the art teachers, who'll all be sacked by then. The ease with which we are willing to sacrifice the salaries of the superficially comfortable academics conceals the significance of the act. College and university teachers will continue to give and to receive the services needed to advance in life. But those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder will remain defenseless. Their education and health will decline. When prosperity returns, we will learn that cutthroat capitalism cuts even deeper in a recession."

        "webpage": "The Economic Reality That No One Wants to Talk About\nChancellor's Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, 'Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few''\nMost ideas for creating more jobs assume jobs will return when the economy recovers. So the immediate goal is to accelerate the process. A second stimulus would be helpful, especially directed at state governments that are now mounting an anti-stimulus package (tax increases, job cuts, service cuts) of over $200 billion this year and next. If the deficit hawks threaten to take flight, the administration should use the remaining TARP funds.\nOther less expensive ideas include a new jobs tax credit for any firm creating net new jobs. Lending directed at small businesses, which are having a hard time getting credit but are responsible for most new jobs. A one-year payroll tax holiday on the first, say, $20,000 of income - which would quickly put money into peoples' pockets and simultaneously make it cheaper for businesses to hire because they pay half the payroll tax. And a WPA style program that hires jobless workers directly to, say, insulate homes.\nMost of this would be helpful. Together, they might take the official unemployment rate down a notch or two.\nBut here's the real worry. The basic assumption that jobs will eventually return when the economy recovers is probably wrong. Some jobs will come back, of course. But the reality that no one wants to talk about is a structural change in the economy that's been going on for years but which the Great Recession has dramatically accelerated.\nUnder the pressure of this awful recession, many companies have found ways to cut their payrolls for good. They've discovered that new software and computer technologies have made workers in Asia and Latin America just about as productive as Americans, and that the Internet allows far more work to be efficiently outsourced abroad.\nThis means many Americans won't be rehired unless they're willing to settle for much lower wages and benefits. Today's official unemployment numbers hide the extent to which Americans are already on this path. Among those with jobs, a large and growing number have had to accept lower pay as a condition for keeping them. Or they've lost higher-paying jobs and are now in a new ones that pays less.\nYet reducing unemployment by cutting wages merely exchanges one problem for another. We'll get jobs back but have more people working for pay they consider inadequate, more working families at or near poverty, and widening inequality. The nation will also have a harder time restarting the economy because so many more Americans lack the money they need to buy all the goods and services the economy can produce.\nSo let's be clear: The goal isn't just more jobs. It's more jobs with good wages. Which means the fix isn't just temporary measures to accelerate a jobs recovery, but permanent new investments in the productivity of Americans.\nWhat sort of investments? Big ones that span many years: early childhood education for every young child, excellent K-12, fully-funded public higher education, more generous aid for kids from middle-class and poor families to attend college, good health care, more basic R&D that's done here in the U.S., better and more efficient public transit like light rail, a power grid that's up to the task, and so on.\nWithout these sorts of productivity-enhancing investments, a steadily increasing number of Americans will be priced out of competition in world economy. More and more Americans will face a Hobson's choice of no job or a job with lousy wages. It's already happening.\nCross-posted from Robert Reich's Blog\nFollow Robert Reich on Twitter:\n\nFinancial Crisis Robert Reich Economic Stimulus Package Unemployment Jobs Summit"

        "webpage": "Is the $100 bill the next to go?\n\nThe latest attack on the money in your pocket is the talk about eliminating the highest denomination banknotes. This discussion was intensified in the political policy world with the article by Lawrence Summers that appeared in The Washington Post. Summers is a professor at Harvard and had once been the Secretary of the Treasury and Director of the White House's National Economic Council.\n\nSummers cites a paper by Peter Sands of Harvard and students that claims to make a compelling case to stop issuing high denomination notes and possibly withdraw them from circulation because of its use in crime and corruption.\n\nCrime is mostly a cash-based enterprise. Criminals do not use gold, checks, or credit cards. As those of us who use cash over other payment types understand, cash is more anonymous. Cash transactions can be used to perform untraceable transaction that could be used to evade taxes. Criminals use cash to avoid law enforcement and terrorists use cash to fund their activities outside of the monitoring of financial transactions. In fact, Sands notes that these criminals have nicknamed the \u20ac500 note the \"Bin Laden.\"\n\nIn order to carry out cash-based transactions is the ability to carry the cash. Sands' paper and Summers' article both say that lower denomination currency will make it difficult to carry large volumes of currency in order to make these transactions. Considering the weight of United States currency, carrying $1 million worth of $100 Federal Reserve Notes would weigh about 10 kilograms (22.0462 pounds). Using a 15 liters (just under 4 gallons) as the \"standard\" briefcase capacity, you could carry $1 million in 0.7 cases.\n\nAs a comparison, $1 million worth of $50 Federal Reserve Notes would require 1.4 briefcases and 3.5 briefcases when using $20 notes. If the $1 million was being paid using \u20ac500 notes, it would weigh 2.2 kilograms or about 4.85 pounds that takes up a quarter of a briefcase.\n\nComparison of the weight of the equivalent of $1 million using U.S. Federal Reserve Notes\n\nComparison of the weight of the equivalent of $1 million using euro currency\n\nSands says:\n\nBy eliminating high denomination, high value notes we would make life harder for those pursuing tax evasion, financial crime, terrorist finance and corruption. Without being able to use high denomination notes, those engaged in illicit activities - the \"bad guys\" of our title - would face higher costs and greater risks of detection. Eliminating high denomination notes would disrupt their \"business models\".\n\nSummers agrees with Sands and even suggests that the baseline currencies, specifically the dollar and the euro, should \"stop issuing notes worth more than say $50 or $100.\" Both consider demonetizing these high denomination notes a step in the right direction.\n\n$207 Million in $100 notes seized as part of a drug raid in 2007\n\nIn the world of policy analysis there is the concept of the three-legged stool. The first leg is to identify the policy, which is what Sands' paper does. Next would be to translate the policy idea into something that could be used as the basis for a law. The final step is something to drive the policy to be considered by the lawmakers in order to do something with the policy.\n\nThis is how the one cent coin went from being 95-percent copper to being copper-covered zinc. There was the idea to change the composition of the coin in order to save money. After the idea, there was the research and the law writing that went into changing the composition. As part of that second-leg exercise was the creation of the 1974 aluminum cent pattern. Finally, by 1982, the costs were so out of line that it became the driver that forced action.\n\nAlthough the article and report has been well discussed as part of the financial press it is not likely to be acted on in the near future. It is only the first leg. It will take time before this stool gets its two other legs.\n\nImages were copied from the report \"Making it Harder for the Bad Guys: The Case for Eliminating High Denomination Notes,\" by Peter Sands, et. al."

We consider the GMAT only in the context of a holistic review of all criteria, including the applicant's academic, practical, and socio-economic background. As practical guidance, however, most successful applicants score above 650 on the GMAT, and often score above 700. In addition to the overall score, it is also important to evidence balance between the verbal and quantitative dimensions of the GMAT.\nDoes the Department accept the GRE instead of the GMAT?\nSubstantially all applicants to the accounting Ph.D. program submit GMAT scores. Therefore, for maximum comparability, the Department of Accounting strongly urges Ph.D. applicants to take the GMAT. This advice does not necessarily apply to other departments within the McCombs School of Business.\nWhen is the TOEFL required?\nThe University of Texas at Austin requires the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) for international applicants who do not have a previous university degree from a country in which the only official language is English. Applicants should be cautioned that successful accounting Ph.D. applicants often score in the upper 30s or 40s on both the verbal and quantitative dimensions of the GMAT. In general, the Department evaluates many sources of information that evidence the applicant's English communication skills, so the TOEFL (or its waiver) should not be overemphasized.\nWho should write my three letters of recommendation?\nThis is of course up to you, but if you have both academic and work experience in accounting, a reasonable strategy is to ask two of your former professors and one contact from your work experience to write letters of recommendation. (If you have not informed your employer of your doctoral aspirations, it is fine to request only academic references.) Please be sure to request that your recommenders not only fill out the recommendation grid on the form, but also append comments that attest to your potential for teaching and research in accounting. A free-form recommendation letter is fine for this purpose.\nDoes one need a previous accounting degree to apply to the Ph.D. program in accounting?\nThe program assumes a reasonable institutional background in accounting, equivalent to an undergraduate or master's degree in accounting. We do from time to time admit Ph.D. applicants who do not have an accounting degree (such as applicants with an MBA degree), but these applicants typically have taken enough accounting courses to understand the institutional fundamentals of accounting. Applicants with no accounting background should first take enough accounting courses to acquire knowledge that is the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in accounting before beginning Ph.D. coursework.\nDoes one need accounting work experience to apply to the Ph.D. program in accounting?\nWork experience in accounting, like other credentials, is not so much a requirement as it is a factor that is considered at the margin in a competitive admissions process. Evidence from recent years indicates that successful applicants usually have at least one year, and often two years or more of full-time work experience in some facet of financial reporting, which can involve public accounting, accounting in industry, or taxation. Work experience helps Ph.D. students to incorporate new insights and developments from practice in future research and in teaching.\nWhat quantitative skills are desirable prior to beginning the Ph.D. program in accounting?\nStrong grades in Calculus I and II, Statistics, and Linear Algebra are useful. If your coursework in these subjects is more than five years old, we urge you to systematically review these subjects before you apply.\nHow exactly do I apply?\nFor step-by-step instructions, see How to Apply.\nMcCombs School of Business, The University of Texas at Austin\nPrivacy Policy | Accessibility Policy"

Local governments receive only 5 percent of their revenue directly from the U.S. government, and school districts also only get a sliver of their funding from federal programs, Moody's said. On the whole, the rating agency expects local governments' revenue declines to be limited from sequestration. Still, the $85 billion in automatic cuts stretching from last month through September will lead to $58 million in reductions to \"federal impact aid,\" which is provided to school districts near Native American reservations, military bases and other areas where property tax revenue is kept low by a federal presence. The cut is \"a minimal amount in aggregate, but a material amount for certain districts,\" Moody's said. Those districts can mostly be found in New Mexico. Federal impact aid provides 54 percent of the revenue of Dulce Independent School District, which sits on the state's Northern border, and 47 percent of Gallup-McKinley County School District, in the western part of the state, according to Moody's. The state's Bernalillo Municipal School District, Pojoaque Valley School District and Grants Cibola County School District all depend on the aid for 18 to 23 percent of revenue. New Mexico as a whole is particularly vulnerable to sequestration, and Moody's has a negative outlook on its \"Aaa\"-rating because of the state's close ties to the U.S. government. Federal spending is 12.8 percent of the state's gross domestic product, according to the Pew Center on the States. The Defense Department also is a major employer, and Moody's warned in December that military cuts could put the state's economy at risk. For Lac Du Flambeau School District, in Wisconsin, federal impact aid is 27 percent of general fund revenue and for Indian River Central School District in New York, it is 25 percent. Texas has two school districts that will be affected - Copperas Cove Independent School District, where aid is 23 percent of revenue, and Killeen Independent School District, where it is 19 percent. In California, Muroc Joint Unified School District relies on the funds for 16 percent of revenue.

Dissemination of Data Glossary\nAppendix D Publication information\nFor help viewing PDF files, please click here\nBackground of Statistical Standards\nData quality is the cornerstone of all official statistics programs. To this end there are a number of international and national groups that have devoted considerable time and effort to delineating important concepts and principles for official statistics. On the international front, the United Nations (UN) and the Economic Commission For Europe (ECE) have both adopted a set of \"Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics.\" Included among the 10 principles are calls for statistical agencies to use professional standards that are based on scientific principles to guide the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage, and presentation of statistical data. The principles also call for the inclusion of relevant information on the sources, methods, and procedures of the statistics. In a similar vein, one of the main objectives identified by the Statistics Directorate of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) includes the development of international statistical standards, systems, and collaborations. Similarly, the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) data dissemination standard includes the integrity and quality of data, coverage, periodicity and timeliness, public access to data, and full documentation of the data collection.\nIn the United States, there are two national committees that have each been working for a quarter of a century to improve statistical methods and data quality-the Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (FCSM) and the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT). The Office of Management and the Budget (OMB) convenes the Federal Committee to provide a forum for communicating and disseminating information about statistical practices among all Federal statistical agencies. The FCSM also recommends the introduction of new methodologies in Federal statistical programs to improve data quality.\nThe National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences convenes CNSTAT, a committee of prominent researchers from universities and private research organizations, to study statistical topics to improve the effectiveness of the Federal statistical system. CNSTAT monitors the statistical policy and coordinating activities of the Federal government, reviews the statistical programs of federal agencies and suggests improvements, reviews data-handling and privacy and confidentiality policies and provides recommendations for best practices, studies data gaps and recommends additions as necessary, and reviews extant methodologies and suggests improved statistical methods.\nCNSTAT published a monograph on the \"Principles and Practices for a Federal Agency\" to assist Federal statistical agencies. The main principles include relevance of data, credibility among data users, confidentiality of data, and trust among data providers. Many of the practices identified parallel the \"Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics\" promulgated by the UN and the ECE. For example, statistical agencies should have a commitment to high quality and professional standards. In discussing openness about the data, CNSTAT stresses the importance of providing a full description of the data, the methods used, and assumptions made. The description should include reliable indicators of the kinds and amount of error in the data. CNSTAT also stressed the importance of wide dissemination of data presented in a user-friendly format. The CNSTAT guide was one of the tools used by NCES staff in planning their current revision of the agency's statistical standards. Continue ... IES"

Millennials were also significantly more likely than baby boomers to say they preferred \"tried and true\" investment options. They were four times more likely than baby boomers to say they were unwilling to act on the advice of a financial advisor without first consulting other sources. Forty-four percent said they \"spend a lot of time researching alternatives before making a major purchase decision,\" compared with 33% of baby boomers.\nForty percent millennial respondents said they were \"determined\" to pass along wealth to their families, compared with 25% of baby boomers and Gen Xers (aged 31-45). Forty-four percent described themselves as \"extremely\" interested in improving their understanding of investing, compared with 38% of older respondents.\nAccenture said the survey pointed to unmet demand for online investor education and advisor-interaction tools that could increase millennial investing and help bridge the \"trust gap\" with financial advisors. Presented with concepts for new online educational resources, it said, millennial respondents showed overwhelming interest.\n\"The behaviors and attitudes of millennials are not just a matter of long-term strategy for wealth managers; they are a leading indicator of the need for change today,\" Pigliucci said.\n\"With half of all baby-boom investors currently active in social media and a vast majority active online, the innovations that will capture the millennial generation also will help capture the most coveted demographics among Gen Xers and baby boomers.\"\nAccenture's research has found more than 75 million digitally savvy investors in the U.S. with high income, assets and education, and refers to as \"Generation D\" or \"Gen D.\" This investor demographic, on which Accenture's survey focused, comprises 44% of the online U.S. population, age 18-65, and represents a staggering $27 trillion in total assets.\nThe survey found that Gen D members saw investing as a viable path to building and passing wealth to future generations. They also recognized the need for financial advice, but were less and less likely to view financial advisors as trusted sources.\nFor example, 59% of respondents across all generations said they had actively sought financial advice recently, but only 40% had turned to a financial advisor.\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

        "webpage": "Let's not forget that there are stocks representing both domestic and foreign companies. The market capitalization of all US based companies is a little over \u00bd of the value of all worldwide traded stocks. Many of these foreign stocks are traded on US exchanges. Others can only be traded on the exchanges in their home countries. Also, keep in mind that many US based companies do significant amounts of their business in foreign countries even though they are considered a \"domestic\" company. These would be referred to as multi-national corporations. For example, McDonalds (MCD) has restaurants worldwide. So if you own their stock you would consider it a domestic stock even though it derives more than half of its revenue from outside of the US. Why is this significant? McDonalds is not dependant upon just the US economy for its growth. Also, there is a level of \"currency\" risk for multi-nationals. The earnings from their foreign operations must be \"repatriated\" to US dollars. When the US dollar is weak, this tends to boost their foreign earnings when converted to dollars. Conversely, when the dollar is strong, this will reduce their foreign earnings.\n\nStock indexes are a way to group stocks in various related ways. This provides a way to evaluate or address a related group of stocks using a single reference point. For example, there are indexes based upon market cap and indexes based upon industry segment. There is an index classification for growth stocks versus value stocks. Also, there are indexes that combine one or more of these classifications, for example, an index for large cap growth stocks, etc. So, you can see that the number of indexes can grow quite large. Some of the most well known stock indexes are the Dow Jones Industrials, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Wilshire 5000.\n\nNaturally, there are indexes related to foreign stocks. One of the most referenced is EAFE (Europe, Australasia and the Far East). Naturally, there are market cap and industry sector indexes for foreign stocks as well.\n\nAs for classifications for the universe of bonds or fixed income investments, there are corporate, agency, municipal, US Treasuries, high yield and of course, foreign bonds. When bonds are issued they are assigned a credit rating by agencies such as Moody's or Standard and Poors. Now, you may recall that credit rating agencies played a significant role in the run up to the collapse of credit markets in 2008, so, as always, buyer beware. These credit ratings are supposed to reflect the credit worthiness of the bond issuer and indicate the possibility of a default. These ratings can change after the debt has been issued if the finances of the issuer change significantly. During the credit crisis, the ratings for lots of companies were downgraded, especially for banks and other financial institutions. Debt issued by the US government is considered to be the safest of all. Everything else will be rated accordingly."

The disputes between Google Inc. and the Chinese government have been one factor; others have included the continued concerns raised in the West about China's currency policy, and in China about Western financial policies. Moreover, questions about intellectual property protection in China have not gone away. At the same time, the consumer markets within the country are more vibrant as its pace of growth increases, and Chinese businesses are becoming innovative, fierce competitors within their country, and increasingly in the world outside. There has never been a time when getting China right is more important  -  or more difficult.\nIn this interview, conducted in London in March, strategy+business raised these issues with Edward Tse, author of The China Strategy: Harnessing the Power of the World's Fastest-Growing Economy (Basic Books, 2010). Tse also wrote \"The China Challenge,\" the cover story in s+b's Spring 2010 issue. He is a senior partner with Booz & Company and the firm's chairman for Greater China; he has been advising companies in China and about China for more than 20 years. Tse has written extensively, in our pages and elsewhere, about China's role in global political and business affairs. Here, he looks more closely at the tensions that are raising concerns among some businesspeople, at the reasons most companies cannot afford to ignore China, and at the long-term trends that will likely supersede today's headlines.\nNote: This transcript contains some material not used in the video.\nS+B: What do you say to business leaders who are wondering, \"Do I really have prospects in China?\"\nTSE: I think leaders of global companies have to step back and try to understand what China means to their business. They also have to understand what China has been achieving over the last couple of decades, since it started its economic reforms. Ignoring China is not an option. But the only way a company can take advantage of its massive opportunities is by placing its China activities in a global context  -  as part of an integrated web of capabilities, including manufacturing, marketing and sales, innovation, new business model incubation, and talent development.\nI would recommend that global executives not pay too much attention to the day-to-day news. Instead they should step back and take a longer view.\nS+B: What does that mean? How long is the appropriate distance to look?\nTSE: You could begin by looking back to the start of economic reform by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s. And, more precisely, to 1992, when Deng made his now famous visit to Shenzhen. It was called the \"Southern visit\" at the time, to one of the places where entrepreneurial China got its start. And it was basically to set the tone: \"Look, we've got to continue to open up and integrate ourselves into the global economy.\" Over the decades since, China has held true to that path  -  and it will continue to do so, at least for the next couple of decades.\nIt's important to recognize that China is still undergoing tremendous changes. In the early 2000s, China was seen as principally a source of goods for export and a potential market for multinationals. Now we're going to see a wave of Chinese-developed products, Chinese multinationals, and Chinese money entering the global economy.\nFor example, China has become an incubator for every kind of business  -  from tiny startups to giant multinationals, both foreign and homegrown. Local companies are building platforms with sufficient scale to take their business worldwide. International companies will go to China to integrate this vast market and sourcing hub with their global strategies and operations.\nPage 1 2 3 | All | Next Last> E-Mail"

        "webpage": "BY LEAH BETH WARD, JEFF McKINNEY and PERRY BROTHERS\nGovernments and private banks are offering grants and low-interest loans to help individuals and businesses clean up and rebuild. But borrowers beware: Not all loans are created equal.\nMany area banks are offering special financing and much quicker approval than the government, whose loans can take several weeks or longer to process.\nBank loans can be used immediately to start the repair process or supplement a strained family budget until insurance claims or other disaster relief is paid.\nAnd the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB) on Friday established a $100 million disaster recovery fund - available through June - for communities affected by the flooding in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. A list of participating institutions will be available next week.\nBut the government's terms are hard to beat, especially for lower-income flood victims, and should be considered before a private-sector loan, officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) say.\nIn either case, experts say borrowers need to step back first and approach their situation analytically. Bernard Kaiser, executive director of Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS) of Cincinnati, said it is crucial to work out a budget before asking for a federal or bank loan.\n''Don't jump into anything,'' he said. ''Look at your assets and then sit down and figure out 'What do I need to get by?' - the bare basics.''\nFEMA money can be a direct grant for housing assistance, which does not have to be repaid, or a loan for physical damage and economic loss through the federal Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBA's involvement should not deter individuals; they are eligible for loans along with businesses.\nFEMA loan rates start at 4 percent and can go to 8 percent, depending on the borrower's personal financial situation and credit history, according to Carl Suchocki, spokesman in Washington, D.C.\nMr. Suchocki noted that FEMA loans, unlike bank loans, are restricted. ''The use has to be dedicated to the disaster,'' he said.\nHousing grants are capped at $10,000. Homeowners can borrow up to $200,000 for their primary residence and up to $40,000 to cover personal property. Loans to businesses are capped at $1.5 million.\nLocal financial institutions are offering a variety of flood-related loans, and many say they will work with customers on a case-by-case basis to try to meet specific loan situations.\nCentennial Savings Bank in Westwood, which has made a commitment to receive $10 million through the FHLB fund, will offer loans at below-market rates, said Michael Collins, assistant vice president of lending.\nMr. Collins could not say how the loans will be priced but said the bank will try to process requests in a matter of days. Usually, the process takes two to four weeks.\nKeyBank in Cincinnati is offering special low-rate, no-fee, home-improvement loans to get cash to flood victims within 24 hours. The unsecured loans, which can be used for home repairs, will carry an interest rate 2 percent below the bank's regular rate. The minimum loan amount has been lowered from $3,000 to $1,000, and a $50 fee has been waived.\nCincinnati-based Star Bank is offering a package that enables borrowers to receive a half percentage point reduction in standard rates on new loans. The first payment can be deferred for six months, and there are no closing costs.\nBut bank loans most likely are out of reach for flood victims who have little or no credit or lack assets against which to borrow. Mr. Kaiser, the credit counselor, advises people in such situations to still prepare a budget that includes their income potential and a list of absolute necessities.\nFlood victims with substantial outstanding indebtedness should not dismiss creditors' willingness to work out lenient repayment terms. And don't borrow anew needlessly.\n''What you don't want to do is run to your bank and re-sign a mortgage or talk to credit organizations about consolidation,'' Mr. Kaiser said. ''Those might be good things to do at some point, but now is not the time to make that decision.''\nFLOOD STORIES\nFLOOD PHOTOS\nRecovering financially\nExperts from the American Red Cross and the National Endowment for Financial Education advise the flood-stricken to take the following steps for financial recovery:\nOnce back in your home, take an inventory.\nReconstruct lost records for insurance claims, tax deductions or government aid. County property records can help determine the value of land and buildings.\nCall creditors to negotiate payment reductions.\nPromptly file an insurance claim even if your home is not specifically covered for the type of disaster that occurred. You might be surprised at what's covered.\nWhen dealing with an adjuster, take notes and compare estimates with neighbors.\nConsider loans and grants. The Small Business Administration, despite its name, makes disaster-relief loans to homeowners and owners of personal property.\nWatch for opportunities for tax deductions.

Determined to avoid the mistakes of their predecessors in the wake of World War I, European leaders realised that the best way to ensure lasting peace was to encourage co-operation and reconstruction, rather than punish the defeated.\nThe Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) was established in 1948 to run the US-financed Marshall Plan for reconstruction of a continent ravaged by war. By making individual governments recognise the interdependence of their economies, it paved the way for a new era of cooperation that was to change the face of Europe. Encouraged by its success and the prospect of carrying its work forward on a global stage, Canada and the US joined OEEC members in signing the new OECD Convention on 14 December 1960. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was officially born on 30 September 1961, when the Convention entered into force.\nOther countries joined in, starting with Japan in 1964. Today, 34 OECD member countries worldwide regularly turn to one another to identify problems, discuss and analyse them, and promote policies to solve them. The track record is striking. The US has seen its national wealth almost triple in the five decades since the OECD was created, calculated in terms of gross domestic product per head of population. Other OECD countries have seen similar, and in some cases even more spectacular, progress.\nSo, too, have countries that a few decades ago were still only minor players on the world stage. Brazil, India and the People's Republic of China have emerged as new economic giants. The three of them, with Indonesia and South Africa, are Key Partners of the Organisation and contribute to its work in a sustained and comprehensive manner. Together with them, the OECD brings around its table 39 countries that account for 80% of world trade and investment, giving it a pivotal role in addressing the challenges facing the world economy.\nOrganisation for European Economic Cooperation\nThe Marshall Plan speech\nConvention on the OECD\nBetter policies for better lives: The OECD at 50 and beyond\nHistory of the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette\nList of OECD Secretaries-General since 1961\nLibrary & Archives: OECD Centre for External Researchers\nVisiting the OECD"

Worse, the new formula stops measuring strict want and instead measures a more vague \"inequality\" of income.\nThe Obama administration has reinvented the poverty formula and is now calling it the \"supplemental\" poverty line.\n\"'New' is not necessarily 'improved,'\" Kaus dourly notes.\nAs Kaus explains, the old formula was based on, \"the level that bought a minimal market basket of food in 1963-4, adjusted for subsequent inflation and multiplied by three.\" The goal was to measure what level of income could afford basic survivability in the current economy, giving a base line of income that could meet basic human needs.\nBut the new formula is more complicated and \"deceptive\" to boot.\nThe new \"supplemental\" poverty line is a complicated measure produced by formulas that are barely understood by poverty experts. It takes into account in-kind government benefits, which is fine, and regional costs-of-living. But at its core it is a deception: it measures not absolute poverty but relative poverty - i.e. inequality.\nKaus points out that in the past it was possible to see rates of poverty decrease as the nation grew, but now that won't be possible, much to the delight of the Old Media establishment.\nUnder the old poverty line, \"poverty\" could be eliminated as society got richer - an achievable and widely shared goal. But the new poverty line will rise as society gets richer (\"adjust for rising levels and standards of living\"). The newly measured poor will always be with us in substantial numbers, just as there will always be a third of the American population trapped in the bottom third of the income charts. That will yield a permanent, inextinguishable stream of NYT front page \"poverty\" stat stories - even if \"poverty\" no longer means \"poverty\" in the sense we now understand the term.\nKaus isn't the only one that noticed this change. Richard Bavier, a veteran economic analyst at the Brookings Institute, says the new poverty line formula is \"carefully designed so that the public will think it is one thing when it really is something else.\"\nGranted poverty will always be with us, but now the Obama administration and its compliant Old Media lapdogs have made sure that it can never improve regardless of how well the country does!"

The new report, \"Saving the American Dream: Heritage's Plan to Fix the Debt, Cut Spending, and Restore Prosperity,\" constitutes \"a complete rethinking and realignment of the federal government,\" Heritage President Edwin J. Feulner said.\n\"America is on the brink of national decline because Congress has been spending beyond its means,\" Feulner said. \"But we do not have to accept decline and the death of the American Dream. Our new report shows how - by getting entitlements under control, balancing the budget and, therefore, reinvigorating the economy and America's sense of self-reliance.\" The Heritage plan lays out specific policy recommendations in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, health insurance, the tax code and federal spending. A key element is replacing today's complicated tax system with a simpler, flat-rate system. The new rate would subsume all federal payroll and most excise taxes while eliminating double taxation on savings. The aim is to encourage savings and investments to spark economic growth. \"Faster growth through economic freedom will enable more and more Americans to build both a solid and secure life and retirement for themselves and the means, as a community, to help those who worked hard but did not have the means to support themselves in retirement,\" the report says. Heritage's plan also reworks Social Security and Medicare. Rather than serving as income-replacement programs with unsustainable spending levels, they would be reshaped to work as \"real insurance programs,\" ensuring that America's seniors don't spend their last years in poverty or face financial ruin due to catastrophic health care costs. The plan also stops the spiraling increases of non-defense spending by limiting the federal government's role in local issues, shifting more functions to the private sector and eliminating duplicative and inefficient programs. It holds defense spending at 4 percent so that the government's core constitutional responsibility of protecting the nation is not compromised. Heritage's economic modeling forecasts the plan:\nBalances the federal budget in 10 years and keeps it balanced. Preserves tax revenue levels at no more than 18.5 percent of the economy. Reduces the nation's debt from 70 percent (and rising) to 30 percent within 25 years, then continuing downward. Reshapes the size of the federal government by about half within 25 years. Eliminates the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act while creating an affordable health care system for the nation as well as families and individuals. Provides powerful incentives for workers to save, invest and create more wealth. \"The good news is that we can do this,\" the Heritage report concludes. \"We can guarantee economic security to middle-aged and older Americans even as we reduce the crippling debt that we have piled onto the shoulders of the young.\" The Heritage Foundation's Saving the American Dream plan was developed as part of the Solutions Initiative and funded by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. The Peterson Foundation convened organizations with a variety of perspectives to develop plans addressing our nation's fiscal challenges. Those receiving grants were: American Enterprise Institute, Bipartisan Policy Center, Center for American Progress, Economic Policy Institute, The Heritage Foundation and Roosevelt Institute Campus Network. The six organizations had discretion and independence to develop their own goals and propose comprehensive solutions. The Peterson Foundation's involvement does not represent endorsement of any plan. The final plans developed by each of the organizations will be presented as part of the Peterson Foundation's second annual Fiscal Summit later this month. The Heritage Foundation is the nation's most broadly supported public policy research institute, with more than 710,000 individual, foundation and corporate donors. Founded in 1973, it develops public policy solutions that advance free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional values and a strong national defense."

        "webpage": "The new paradigm\n\nDismantling Nancy Pelosi\n\nAccording to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, \"For every dollar a person receives in food stamps, $1.79 is put back into the economy. It is the biggest bang for the buck when you do food stamps and unemployment insurance. The biggest bang for the buck.\"\n\nIt's the biggest bang for the buck versus what? There is a basic concept in economics known as opportunity cost, which teaches us that for every choice we make, there is a cost which is related to the next-best choice available. In other words, if unemployment and food stamps provide the biggest bang for the buck, does that mean it's better to be unemployed than employed? Let's put this under the microscope.\n\nJoe the Salesman generates commission income for his company of 5% of the amount of sales produced. Out of the income generated for the company, Joe receives a cut of 50%. Let's assume that Joe personally makes gross pre-tax commission income of $50,000 in a year. In order to generate this income Joe's sales must have been $2,000,000 for the year. The company Joe works for receives commission income of $100,000 and pays Joe his cut of 50%, or $50,000.\n\nWhat has Joe produced? Joe has contributed a total of $2,000,000 in economic activity in order to earn his pay. This $2,000,000 will multiply throughout the economy vertically and horizontally through related businesses and suppliers. Joe earns his keep and is a productive member of society.\n\nNow let's look at Joe after he has been laid off and becomes a recipient of unemployment benefits and food stamps:\n\nJoe is now on unemployment and he receives $15,800 per year in unemployment benefits and $5,000 in food stamps. Joe produces nothing to receive this income. Sure, Joe still spends all of his money on rent, food and the basic necessities, but the multiplier effect can only be calculated on the $20,800 that Joe receives and spends. The unemployment checks that Joe receives are generated from unemployment insurance payments made by his former employer, leaving the employer with less money to work with, as well as a smaller amount of sales and productivity. The food stamps he receives are funded by taxpayer dollars, which are currently paid for by money, which is being borrowed by the federal government. [Note: When congress chose to extend unemployment benefits for up to 99 weeks, the added cost was also deficit-financed.]\n\nSo if we are talking about the multiplier effect, then which Joe has the greatest impact, the working Joe, or the unemployed Joe?\n\nAssuming that Nancy Pelosi was correct in her statement that, for every dollar spent on unemployment insurance and food stamps $1.79 is added to the economy, and assuming that the same multiple applies to the private sector, which sector will provide the biggest bang for the buck?\n\nWorking Joe produced $2,000,000 in gross sales, so he will have added $3,580,000 in economic activity.\n\nUnemployed Joe produced nothing, but did consume $20,800 worth of goods and services. However, out of this, $15,800 was taken from his former employer, and $5,000 from taxpayers, which reduced their consumption dollar-for-dollar. In effect, unemployed Joe took $20,800 from another working Joe and spent the other working Joe's money. But the other working Joe would have spent or invested the same money anyway. Thus, in my opinion, the multiplier effect of unemployed Joe is zero, since just a different Joe is spending the same money.\n\nTo make matters worse, not only is the unemployment and food stamps multiplier zero, it is negative, in my opinion. Why? Because of the fact that unemployed Joe's food stamps and part of his unemployment benefits were paid for with deficit-financed money. Generations of working Joe's across the country will be paying interest on this debt, through higher taxes, for years to come and eventually will have paid more than twice the initial amount in principal and interest payments. On top of this, Joe's former employer is on the hook for higher unemployment insurance premiums, which could have been invested or spent to create additional jobs.\n\nLesson: All private sector employees produce more than they are paid, that's the whole point. Unemployed persons produce nothing and merely spend dollars that would have been spent or otherwise invested more productively. The biggest bang for the buck is achieved through implementing government policies, which promote private sector growth, not through unemployment insurance and food stamps."

Economy\n6 Things Surnames Can Say About Social Mobility Share Tweet E-mail Comments Print By Dustin Dwyer Originally published on Tue October 16, 2012 3:31 pm\nUsing data on surnames dating back almost 1,000 years, economic historian Gregory Clark says he's found evidence that families rise and fall across generations at a much slower rate than anyone previously thought. And he says that rate remains constant across national boundaries and time periods. Clark is writing a book about his research, and he says he's still working out some of his conclusions, but here are six possible takeaways from what he's found so far: 1. Some names are more informative than others. Much of Clark's research comes from rare surnames. In some cases, only a few dozen people might have the name in any country. Names like Bazalgette or Pepys are very elite names in England. But extremely common names also tell Clark a lot. Names like Smith or Baker started out as working-class names. Using the records at Oxford and Cambridge, Clark was able to figure out when those names reached average representation among the elites. You can also use names to identify minority groups. For example, 90 percent of people in the United States who have the name Washington are African-American. But not every name is interesting. I asked Clark to look at my name. We found out that there is nothing special about Dwyers. 2. Swedish bus drivers have it made. Part of the reason Clark's data is so different from what other researchers have found is that income is not always a good measure of a person's status. For example, many previous studies have shown that Sweden has a high level of mobility compared with other countries. Clark says that's because Sweden has much less income disparity. On average, Swedish doctors make less money than doctors in the U.S., and Swedish bus drivers make more. Clark's point is, in terms of class standing, a bus driver is a bus driver. Still, if you're a Swedish bus driver, the extra income probably seems like a good thing. 3. India is the outlier. Clark's research shows a remarkable consistency for social mobility rates around the world, with one exception: India. Families in India seem to be stuck in their class group for longer than in other countries. The obvious explanation for this is India's historic caste system. Clark looked at surnames in West Bengal and found that policies to undo the effects of the caste system have helped some groups. But the overall rate of mobility is still very low compared with the rest of the world. Clark believes that's because people in India still tend to marry within their class group. 4. The effects of slavery in the U.S. will finally fade away  -  in a few hundred years. By showing that social mobility happens much more slowly than previously thought, Clark makes a strong case for why the effects of slavery are still with us. The good news in Clark's research is that African-American families seem to be climbing the social ladder as quickly as other groups in the U.S. today. But his model predicts it will take a long time before we can say we've actually moved beyond slavery. It might happen sometime in the 2300s. 5. French-Canadian immigrants are a disadvantaged minority in the U.S. Clark says there was a substantial immigration of French-Canadians into the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th century. This is a distinct group from the descendants of French immigrants you might find in Louisiana, and Clark says you can track them through names like Gagnon, Hebert and Cote. \"Only half as many people from French-Canadian origin are doctors than you would expect,\" Clark says. \"Half as many are attorneys.\" This leads to one of the benefits of using surnames to track status, according to Clark. \"You can discover kind of underprivileged groups within a society that people in general would probably not even have recognized,\" he says. 6. Your ancestors may determine your fate, but you still need to get out of bed in the morning. \"Social mobility in some sense, it gets to one of the fundamental things that we think about,\" says Clark. \"Which is, what is the nature of human agency, and what is it to be a person in a society where eventually a lot of things may just be predictable about us?\" Clark says that as much as 60 percent of your outcome in life may be determined by your lineage. To some, that's a depressing number. But, remember, Clark is describing a model within which there can be a lot of variation. And even if you come from a long line of rich doctors, you still have to do the work if you want to be a doctor too.Copyright 2013 Michigan Radio. To see more, visit . View the discussion thread."

        "webpage": "Taking the Next Step in KYC and AML ComplianceRegulators are demanding more and more from banks' KYC and AML monitoring, making it increasingly necessary for the industry to collaborate on this costly area of regulation.Regulators appear to have increasingly high expectations for banks regarding their Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) policies and tools. And financial institutions are struggling to keep up with the pressure of those raised expectations, according to industry executives that participated in a panel on compliance yesterday at the SWIFT Business Forum.\n\"For securities regulators, everything right now is leading back to AML. They always ask, 'Why didn't your AML monitoring catch this?'\" Bill Fox, global financial crimes compliance senior executive and managing director for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told the audience.\nRegulators are expecting AML and KYC screening to help financial institutions identify a range of financial crime activities, said Richard Small, the SVP of enterprise anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and international regulatory compliance for American Express. \"To the regulators, it's about the AML controls. They're not alleging money laundering, they're identifying the faults with the controls in place,\" he explained.\n[For More from the SWIFT Business Forum This Week: Major Banks Sign Up for SWIFT's KYC Registry]\nThis regulatory focus forces banks to perfect those controls at a high cost, or face stiff penalties like the $2 billion in fines that J.P. Morgan Chase was leveled with earlier this year for failure to file suspicious activity reports. Many banks have invested in AML monitoring solutions to meet compliance standards, but monitoring solutions alone will not meet regulators' expectations. The industry will have to take the extra step to learn how to collaborate on KYC and AML to help deal with the growing cost of compliance and demands from regulators, Bank of America's Bill Fox said.\n\"If any financial crimes compliance people out there have just plugged in a monitoring system and think that they're done -- you're going to be flooded with alerts without any context,\" he warned.\nBank of America has taken a unique approach to AML that goes beyond their monitoring systems, and has seen impressive results in terms of efficiency, Fox related. Rather than hiring large numbers of staff to sift through alerts from their monitoring systems, the bank created an in-house system that compiles information from different sources such as its monitoring reports, news reports, alerts issued by regulators, and then turns that feedback into \"events,\" Fox said. Those events are then rated for risk, and if an event has a high enough rating then it is reviewed by a staff member.\nThat infrastructure has enabled the bank to achieve a 70% conversion rate in terms of how many alerts that it receives require an action for compliance, Fox reported.\nThat conversion ratio is far ahead of where many players in the industry are, Richard Small of American Express noted. Most banks have rates that are more like 5-7%.\nEven though Bank of America has seen great results from its controls and protocols, the cost of compliance is growing to a point that is not sustainable for many banks, Bill Fox suggested. \"The way that the regulators are setting standards now... I wonder if they are commercially viable,\" he said.\nControls have to be so tight now that it is damaging the correspondent banking system in that legitimate transactions are now being rejected because they are too difficult or expensive to verify, Fox shared.\n\"AML monitoring should be a net -- not a wall -- and the net should be tighter in certain places with higher risk... the thing now is that every single thing matters, and no one can afford to have a problem in this space. So firms are drawing the net tighter and tighter, and it's becoming a wall,\" Fox observed.\nThe high cost and stringent demands of regulatory compliance is also raising the cost of deploying new products, making it hard for banks to do their day-to-day business, Richard Small said. \"Every time we're trying to introduce a new product, and we have conversations about the necessary controls before launch, I get questions around the cost of controls... and the cost of a new product launch now is big,\" he related.\nBoth Fox and Small agreed that the best way to meet regulatory requirements while setting high standards for AML and KYC is for the industry to collaborate more. \"We should take charge as an industry of what we can take charge of,\" Fox stated. \"If we can get together and set high standards that are commercially viable... that is a much better place for us to be in.\"\nCurrently there is no set standard for gathering the information necessary for KYC and AML compliance, with different institutions taking different approaches, Richard Small said. \"I think if SWIFT can help set a standard on KYC maybe we can get to a standard that regulators are comfortable with,\" he added.\n[To learn more about how financial firms are preparing for and responding to security incidents, attend the Acknowledge the Inevitable: How to Prepare For, Respond to, and Recover from a Security Incident session at Interop 2014 in Las Vegas, March 31-April 4.

Good News: Finance Lowers Expectations\nFinance teams are getting less ambitious about their large-scale, transformational initiatives - which may result in finance actually getting more done.\nBy Treasury & Risk Staff February 14, 2014 \u2022 Reprints\nLast week, The Hackett Group released a report aptly titled \"Transforming the Finance Organization: Ambition vs. Reality.\" It combines the results of two Hackett research projects and reaches the conclusion that finance teams have been biting off more than they can chew when it comes to transformational projects. However, Hackett also finds that finance executives' change agenda in 2013 was considerably more modest than it was a couple years prior - suggesting that ambition in the finance function may be starting to align more closely with reality.\nIn its 2013 \"Key Issues Study,\" Hackett asked finance executives in a wide range of companies whether their organization has global standards in eight areas: technology infrastructure, key performance indicators (KPIs) and reporting, talent management, master data, centers of excellence/transaction processing centers, setting policies and strategies, designing and building processes, and operations/process execution. See Figure 1, below.\nIn each of these areas, respondents were asked to pick the category of global standardization that best describes their organization's current state and the category that they expect to reach in the next two to three years. Many respondents selected one category to describe their company's current state (e.g., \"predominantly global - 51% to 80%\") and picked the next category up to describe where they expect to be in a few years (e.g., \"maximum global level achievable - more than 80%\"). The category with the most respondents reporting that their organization already has global standards was \"policy/strategy standards\" - 19 percent said they're at the maximum level achievable, and 16 percent said they're predominantly global. These numbers are strong, yet 30 percent of respondents expect to reach the maximum level within three years, while 16 percent expect to be predominantly global at that time. If these projects are successful, the proportion of companies at the maximum achievable level of globalization in policy/strategy standards would increase by more than 50 percent in just a few years.\nThe question is: How likely are they to be successful? \"The reality is that over the past two years, the data from our annual 'Key Issues Study' show no measurable increase in the level of global standards across business services,\" last week's Hackett report states. Lynne Schneider, senior research director with Hackett and one of the report's authors, puts it this way: \"Across the board, people are optimistic about how much change they can execute in the next two to three years, relative to what they did in the past two to three years. I think the difference may be ambition versus reality.\"\nComparing the data from Hackett's latest \"Key Issues Study\" with the 2011 version of the same survey brings the challenge into stark focus. Look at how respondents' 2011 projections of where they expect to be in two to three years (the red lines on Figure 1) compare with the 2013 reality (the green lines). For example, organizations may be more advanced in global policy/strategy standards than in other areas, but three years ago 47 percent of companies expected to be at the maximum achievable level of global standardization by now, and only 19 percent have actually reached that goal.\nPerhaps because so many companies failed to achieve their goals from a few years ago, comparing finance's 2011 expectations (the red lines) with the expectations for two to three years from now (the blue lines) reveals a serious reduction in ambition. A quarter of 2011 respondents expected t"

The opposition MPs and the finance and economic affairs parliamentary committee asked the government to institute practical and strategic measures to curb money laundering in Tanzania.\n\"The government must be very tough in order to stamp out this dangerous vice,\" said Dr Abdallah Kigoda, when presenting the committee's views after the Finance Minister Mustafa Mkulo tabled the Anti-Money laundering (Amendment) Bill-2012  -  for debate and subsequent endorsement by the House.\nThe committee urged the government to fast-track preparation of relevant supportive regulations in order to enhance effective enforcement of the anti-money laundering law, considering the magnitude of the problem in the country.\nAccording to the committee, the regulations would set limits on the amount of money a foreign national or a Tanzanian would be allowed to transfer to other countries.\n\"Without strict regulations, it would be impossible to know the amount of money (money laundering) currently being transferred from our country to other countries,\" said Kigoda, noting: \"A lot of our money is being transferred to other countries...this is not healthy for the country's economy and of course, it is one of the forces behind rapid depreciation of the Tanzanian shilling.\"\nThe committee called on the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to put up strict controls to ensure effective implementation of financial laws in a drive to prevent money laundering, which is becoming a serious disease in Tanzania.\nKigoda underlined the need to adhere to ethics and patriotism, on the part of executives of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), as proposed in the Bill, in the course of conducting their duties. \"The committee proposes that these executive should keep secrets while in service and out of service,\" said the committee.\nThe opposition camp said money laundering was widespread in the country, and that pioneers of the illicit money were coming in the name of investors and importers of goods and services.\n\"These people using financial systems and structures...siphon a lot of money out of Tanzania. It's a big threat to our economy. It is a major threat to the economic and social future of Tanzanians,\" said Christina Mughwai, shadow finance minister, when presenting opposition views.\nThe opposition told the government to put up strong legal and regulatory frameworks to control money laundering, adding that the anti-money laundering unit (FIU) which would be formed by this law needs to be independent.\n\"It is illogical to put such a sensitive unit under finance ministry...it should be completely independent,\" said Mughwai.\nContributing, Zitto Kabwe said latest SADC reports show that Tanzania and Malawi are the main heavens of illicit money  - \"engineers of illegal money are coming into our country with dirty money...invest them in real estate, which is currently not even regulated.\"\nQuoting the same report, the legislator said Tanzania provides space for money launders to clean up their illicit money through various investments and later on transfer cleaned money to other countries.\n\"Worse, the finance minister has failed to draft regulations for the Anti-money Laundering Act since it came into force six years ago...how come, the minister is coming again to seek House approval for amendment of the Act, while he had failed to prepare supportive regulations for years?\" questioned the MP.\nThe amendments were passed by the National Assembly last evening."

This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.\nOn March 10, 2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with Paraguay.1\nParaguay's economic performance in recent years has been characterized by slow economic growth and increasing unemployment and poverty rates. This stagnation reflects structural impediments to growth, exacerbated by external and domestic shocks. In 2002, the economy fell into its worst recession in decades, with real GDP down by 2\u00bd percent, according to official estimates, or 4\u00bd percent, according to staff estimates, while inflation accelerated to 14\u00bd percent. The decline reflected a combination of factors, including the worsening external environment, a drought and the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, and political uncertainties which hampered economic policy making. The banking system was seriously affected by the recession and by contagion from the regional crisis, with the collapse of the third-largest bank triggering sizable deposit outflows. The guarani depreciated by 34 percent vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar, although in real effective terms it declined by only 2\u00bd percent due to the sharp decline of neighboring currencies. The public finances also deteriorated sharply in 2002. The consolidated public sector deficit increased to 3 percent of GDP, mainly because of weak tax revenues, higher capital spending, and financial difficulties in key public enterprises. Severe financing constraints led to sizable arrears by early 2003, including to multilateral lenders. Repeated attempts by the government to adopt a comprehensive adjustment and reform program with multilateral support failed, mainly because of the lack of domestic consensus in the increasingly politicized environment before national elections scheduled for April 2003. Paraguay faces a difficult economic outlook in 2003. While better climatic conditions in agriculture and some stability in Argentina will keep GDP from falling as sharply as in 2002, continuing domestic policy uncertainty and the effects of foot-and-mouth disease are expected to depress growth.2 With the new administration scheduled to take office on August 15, the policy making environment may improve.

October 2, 2013\nHow Heritage Financial Uses Withdrawal Rates and Alts for HNW Clients Everyone has budgetary issues, regardless of net worth, says Heritage's Bean\n\"We let clients know when it's time to get selfish,\" said Chuck Bean, when referring to one of the five high-net-worth markets his firm currently serves.\nBean, President and Director of Wealth Management with Boston-based Heritage Financial Services, was commenting on inherited wealth, and the tendency for high-net-worth families to want to help their children and grandchildren. All well and good, Bean noted, until it starts to negatively affect the parents. It's all part of a larger pattern Bean and his team are currently seeing.\n\"We're managing clients' cash flow and spending habits regardless of portfolio size,\" he told ThinkAdvisor on Monday. \"Managing their expectations is the single biggest challenge we face right now. It's something that comes up on a weekly basis during our client review meetings and the financial planning committee meetings we hold at our firm.\"\n\"With the stock market up nicely this year, he added, clients feel that their spending habits can increase. But, clients need to realize that within their diversified portfolio, there are other asset classes that are not performing as well. Their spending level must be consistent with a prudent withdrawal rate based on a long term expected return from the entire portfolio.\"\n\"Everyone has budgetary issues, regardless of net worth,\" he emphasized. \"For this reason, we employ a simple green, yellow and red light system to show them where they are using our financial planning spreadsheets. We tell them what they can afford and not afford to spend in order to secure or maintain their retirement.\"\nHeritage manages $825 million in assets for about 300 core families with investible assets \"in the low singles of millions to low tens of millions\" range. In addition to inherited or family wealth, the other four markets they serve include retirees; single and widowed women; business owners and entrepreneurs; and professionals (with a heavy emphasis on physicians).\nSophisticated clients typically require sophisticated strategies.\n\"As far as alternative investments, depending on the client, we allocate anywhere from 10-25% of the portfolio in total,\" Bean explained. \"We have about 10% in managed futures, which have been a sore spot in the portfolio since 2009, but historically has helped hold up the portfolio in bear markets. We also have about 2.5% in gold, which has also been down, surprisingly, even with the government shutdown. And, some clients have small allocations to hedge funds, private equity and private credit to help enhance risk adjusted returns.\"\nAside from alternative investments, he noted, the firm allocates to multi-asset-class funds. While not technically alternative investments, they still act to reduce correlation. These managers have the flexibility to dial up and down exposure to global stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.\"\n\"All of these things provide more diversity in the portfolio, but more importantly, they also provide more opportunities to rebalance.\"\nAs to the appropriate withdrawal rate for clients  -  even high-net-worth clients  -  Bean doesn't buy the academic mumbo-jumbo, specifically as it relates to \"rules of thumb\" for retirement income. \"We don't adhere to something like the 4% rule because it was constructed at a time when expected rates of return were much higher,\" he concluded. \"We, like many firms, employ model portfolios, and have target rates of return for each objective. If the long term target return is 6%, and we expect inflation to be 2.5%, then a viable rate of withdrawal might be 3.5%; or if the portfolio has an objective of returning 5%, a comfortable withdrawal rate would be about 2.5%. Anything more won't keep pace with inflation and maintain the buying power of the investments. Although, we do have clients that are not trying to preserve inflation-adjusted wealth for the next-generation, and don't mind spending down the principal. But, this can be a risky game of cat and mouse while trying to ensure the assets out last the client. \"We aggressively stress test the model portfolios in various scenarios, and the withdrawal rate is a constant challenge we deal with, yet we deal with it very successfully.\"\nCharles Bean will be a speaker at this year's Think Retirement Income Conference in Boston on Oct. 10 and 11.

Barrett and Steven Hadjilogiou\nIt is quite common that a single business operates through the use of multiple entities such as partnerships, corporations, and, in the international context, through foreign corporations or partnerships. For tax purposes, the intercompany transactions by and among commonly controlled entities may be scrutinized by the IRS and the income, deductions, credits, and other allowances among two or more organizations, trades, or businesses may be reallocated under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7482. The transfer of foreign intellectual property to foreign operating companies by a U.S. multinational business is an area that has been the subject of much discussion. The structure can often result in a foreign corporate subsidiary reducing its effective foreign tax rate to below 15 percent. Thus, a U.S.-based company that generates income and operates outside the United States, whether publicly traded or closely held, can be greatly benefitted by such a structure. In 2000, the world's gross domestic product (GDP) was $32 trillion.1 At that time, U.S. GDP accounted for about $10 trillion (or about one-third) of the world's GDP.2 Ten years later in 2010, U.S. GDP had climbed to $14 trillion, and the world GDP had climbed to $63 trillion.3 As such, in 10 years, the U.S. share of world GDP went down from one-third of the world's GDP to one-quarter. Similarly, the number of cell phones in the world has increased from 15.5 per hundred in 2001 to 86.7 per hundred (i.e., 4.6 billion) in 2010.4 Computers and telephones permit much easier access to individuals around the world. Thomas L. Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum illustrate how a multinational, closely held business can be readily formed in their recently published book That Used To Be Us.5 In their example, they discuss a company named EndoStim. The example discusses how six people from three continents readily formed a cutting edge company in the medical devices field to develop a sophisticated device based on a heart pacemaker. Through the Internet, they were able to obtain financing, develop a prototype, and supervise the manufacture of the device. Over the last 30 years, U.S. companies have significantly increased their international operations. These companies now have more significant marketing, research and development, and sales operations outside the United States. Inevitably, this has led to a greater number of employees working outside the United States. It also has led to a greater amount of intellectual property being developed and exploited offshore. Moreover, companies headquartered outside the United States account for a greater share of the world's sales.\nThe tax world has followed this trend. The increasing international presence of U.S. multinationals has resulted in a significant amount of public scrutiny. Feature articles on these ownership structures have been the subject of extensive articles in the New York Times,6 The Wall Street Journal,7 and 60 Minutes.8 Also, with regard to the legislative discussions concerning the future of U.S. income taxation of U.S. corporations, the taxation of internationally held intellectual property has constituted a significant portion of the tax debates in the U.S. Congress. This article describes how U.S. multinational corporations have held their intellectual property, the U.S. and foreign tax consequences to this ownership, and how the tax benefits of this ownership can be utilized by closely held businesses.\nDescription of Basic IP Ownership and Tax Benefits The ownership structure is designed to mirror the increased international nature of the U.S. company. Thus, a company that, initially, may have managed all of its IP in the United Sta"

More than two years after the revolution, Tunisia is struggling with high unemployment and rising violence in its politics.\nAmine Landoulsi\nThe Syria conflict was initially part of a wave of uprisings in 2011 known as the Arab Spring, which began in part as a cry for political freedom and more economic opportunity. Fast-forward to today, when unemployment in some of these countries is among the highest in the world. \"They are depressingly high if you look at the region as a whole,\" Sudeep Reddy, an economics reporter for The Wall Street Journal, tells Tell Me More host Michel Martin. \"About 25 percent of youth, 1 in 4 people, are unemployed, between the ages of 15 and 24  -  and that is actually, probably, undercounting the severity of the problem.\" Martin spoke about Arab youth and unemployment with Reddy and Shadi Hamid, director of research for the Brookings Doha Center. What follows are excerpts from the  Highlights Reddy on unemployment numbers \"It takes some time to get these figures, and most of these numbers are from last year or even the year before, and the economic environment in most of these countries has deteriorated substantially since then, so it's probably much higher. Certain countries, Tunisia, which was seen as the big hope of the region, the spark for the Arab Spring, youth unemployment is well above 30 percent, and there's really little prospect of it coming down anytime soon.\" Reddy on lack of investment \"For decades, these countries actually did a pretty good job of getting education for younger people, of advancing them into secondary education. Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, these are places where people were able to get college degrees, and now they're facing two problems. \"One is just the overall economic backdrop is miserable. When you have this kind of political dysfunction, you're not going to see businesses wanting to invest and create jobs. You're certainly not going to see foreign companies want to come in and do investment in a lot of these areas. \"But also, in many cases, the people who got educations might have gotten the wrong education. There's a lot of skills mismatch going on, and younger people who have these high expectations are waiting and hoping that they will get better jobs instead of getting the jobs that people without education would be getting right now.\" Hamid on economic difficulties in Egypt \"As long as there's a lack of political stability  -  whether that means protests or coups or repressive crackdowns against the opposition, all of that is going to contribute to an environment where not only tourists don't want to come in, but also investors. \"And investors have been waiting on the wings hoping that the situation in Egypt will stabilize so they can start bringing capital back in. But that hasn't happened, and it doesn't seem that Egypt is going to have the kind of necessary stability for the foreseeable future.\" Hamid on economic reforms \"It's simply too politically dangerous because that's going to affect the poor, that's going to affect how much bread or fuel costs. So the question is: Are political leaders willing to actually go through those difficult reforms when that might actually mean that people go to the street and protest? And no one wants to put themselves in that position in one government after another.\"Copyright 2014 NPR. To see more, visit . Peoria Public Radio"

Our governments and companies have continued to aid, trade and invest in the violence, but we can help stop it if we call on key banks, pension funds and businesses to pull out their investments.\n\nIt's not enough just to call for another ceasefire. It's time to take definitive non-violent action to end this decades long nightmare.\n\nOur governments have failed  -  while they have talked peace and passed UN resolutions, they and our companies have continued to aid, trade and invest in the violence. The only way to stop this hellish cycle of Israel confiscating Palestinian lands, daily collective punishment of innocent Palestinian families, Hamas firing rockets, and Israel bombing Gaza is to make the economic cost of this conflict too high to bear.\n\nWe know it works  -  when EU countries issued guidelines not to fund the illegal Israeli settlements it caused an earthquake in the cabinet, and when citizens successfully persuaded a Dutch pension fund, PGGM, to withdraw, it created a political storm.\n\nThis may not feel like a direct way to stop the current killing, but history tells us that raising the financial cost of oppression can pave a path to peace. Click to call on 6 key banks, pension funds and businesses to pull out  -  If we all take smart action now and turn up the heat, they could withdraw, the Israeli economy will take a hit, and we can turn the calculation of the extremists politically profiting from this hell upside down:\n\nIn the last five weeks three Israeli teenagers were murdered in the West Bank, a Palestinian boy was burnt alive, an American kid was brutally beaten up by Israeli police, and now over 40 Gazan kids have died in Israeli air strikes. This is not the \"Middle East conflict\", it's becoming a war on children. And we are becoming numb to this global shame.\n\nThe media makes out like this is an intractable conflict between two equal warring parties, but it is not. Palestinian extremists' attacks on innocent civilians must be condemned and ended but the root of the conflict lies elsewhere  -  in the dispossession of the Palestinian people. Israel currently occupies, colonises, bombs, raids, and controls the water, trade and the borders of a legally free nation that has been recognised by the United Nations. In Gaza, Israel has created the largest open-air prison in the world, and then blockaded it. Now as bombs fall, the families, literally have no way to get out.\n\nThese are war crimes and we wouldn't accept that anywhere else, why accept it in Palestine? Half a century ago Israel and its Arab neighbours went to war and Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza. Occupying territory after war happens all the time. But no military occupation should turn into a decades long tyranny which only fuels and benefits extremists who use terror to target the innocent. And who suffers? The majority of loving families on both sides that just want freedom and peace.\n\nTo many, particularly in Europe and North America, calling for companies to withdraw investments from financing or taking part in Israel's occupation of Palestine sounds completely biased. But it's not  -  this is the most potent non-violent strategy to end the ritual violence, ensure Israelis' security and achieve Palestinian freedom. Israel's power and wealth dwarfs Palestine, and if it refuses to end its illegal occupation, the world must act to make the cost unbearable.\n\nDutch pension fund, ABP, invests in Israeli banks that help fund the colonisation of Palestine. Massive banks like Barclays invest in suppliers of Israeli arms and other occupation businesses. Computer giant Hewlett-Packard supplies sophisticated surveillance to control the movement of Palestinians. And Caterpillar provides bulldozers that are used to demolish Palestinian homes and farms. If we can create the biggest global call ever to get these companies to pull out, we will show clearly that the world will no longer be complicit in this bloodshed. The Palestinian people are calling on the world to support this path and progressive Israelis support it too. Let's join them:\n\nOur community has worked to bring peace, hope, and change to some of the world's toughest conflicts, and often that means taking difficult positions to address the root cause. For years our community has looked for a political solution to this nightmare, but with this new round of horror unfolding in Gaza, the time has come to turn to sanctions and disinvestment to finally help end the horror for Israelis and Palestinians."

        "webpage": "Europe's Imperative: Save Greece, Save Itself\npreviousRemembering Remembering: The Inherent Danger of Giving a EulogyPerry Campaign Readies for Backlash Over Ranch Signnext story\nHilda Ochoa- Brillembourg\nAt this moment, it's more important to build confidence than character in Greece and other struggling countries in the EU. Why is that so hard for Europe's leaders to understand? Effective crisis resolution tragically requires a dynamic and subtle management of seemingly disparate objectives: building character versus building confidence. And \"tragically\" is the right adverb, because the European actors--Germany on one side, and most of Europe on the other--are clashing to destructive effect in negotiating these tradeoffs. Germany is intent on building \"character\" among the so-called PIIGS: Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain. To the Germans, building character is more important than building confidence. Ironically, when it comes to their own banks, the Germans have few qualms about building confidence in their banking institutions by helping restore liquidity and capital. As well they should, but that is not enough.\nOf course, the European Union was not put in place to promote moral hazard among its members. It was established to support trade, productive efficiencies and monetary discipline among European trade partners and the rest of the world. And it was a real success. But the job was left incomplete. Achieving fiscal coordination and discipline was not feasible when the agreements were being negotiated in the 1980s. That task is before us now, and this crisis gives the European leadership an opportunity to do exactly that. But first the most immediate liquidity and solvency problems have to be resolved in a way that builds confidence and an ensuing commitment to fiscal reform, as well as creating an effective lender of last resort to address fiscal unbalance. The cost of rescuing Greece is a fraction of the cost of the EU's collapse.Effective leadership in Europe requires building both character and confidence. The costs of allowing the PIIGS to default and leave the EU would be destructively high for all. UBS estimates that a \"weak\" country leaving the euro would suffer a 40%-50% loss in GDP in the first year alone, which would be followed by significant losses for many years to come. The cost to a \"strong\" country like Germany of leaving the Euro would be a 20%-25% loss of GDP the first year followed by an additional 10%-12.5% of yearly GDP losses for many years following. The losses would stem from unpaid debts leading to banking, corporate and other credit contraction failures. By contrast, the same analysis concludes that a rescue of Greece, Ireland and Portugal entirely by Germany would amount to about 3% of German GDP for one year alone. Of course, no-one is asking Germany to bear this whole load. Even the BRICs have indicated their interest in helping fund an organized debt restructuring. In fact, given the BRICs interest in solving the crisis, another alternative and potentially effective tradeoff between regional, political and economic realities, would be to accept the BRICs offer to help fund the European liquidity shortfalls. Simply, a special fund could be created at the IMF for the purpose of recapitalizing banks and facilitating debt restructuring, along with bringing fiscal policy coherence in the European Union. The BRICs would then get their fair share of voting power at the IMF, which they so clearly want, need and deserve. This would be a good bargain to strike at the right time: Now!\nBuilding confidence, it should be clear to all, is less expensive than building character at this juncture. But building both is paramount and possible, if politicians focus on leadership rather than placating impulsive voters. We can build character along the way by acknowledging there is much blame to go around and correcting the weaknesses imbedded in the European Monetary Union. There is no foolish debtor without a foolish creditor, much like there is no graft without those willing to support corrupt politicians. There should be failures at times like this--but individual depositors need to be protected, and bankers cannot be shielded from their own mistakes at the expense of governments.\nSo yes, European leaders have to build both confidence and character, and they must assume political and financial responsibility for their own lending recklessness. These responsibilities include strengthening the European Central Bank's balance sheet, or indeed its multilateral equivalent; serving as a lender of last resort; and agreeing to coordinated fiscal policy practices over time, as the IMF has encouraged developing countries to do in exchange for facilitating sources of capital. It will take years to do so. But enough already about moral outrage: The stakes are too high. Intelligent process management must trump even the most outraged moralists in this debate.>\nHilda Ochoa- Brillembourg is the president and CEO of Strategic Investment Group."

        "webpage": "Fed Approves Higher Bank Capital Standards\nMARTIN CRUTSINGER | AP Economics Writer\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve approved higher requirements for the amount of capital reserves banks must hold to cushion against unexpected losses. The change is aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed voted 7-0 on Tuesday to approve the 792-page rule. The changes were mandated by the 2010 financial overhaul law and an international agreement. The rule must also be approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Those agencies were expected to act as soon as next week. Banks had lobbied to modify the requirements on higher capital, saying they could hamper their ability to lend. But experts said most big banks have already increased their capital reserves. \"With these revisions to our capital rules, banking organizations will be better able to withstand periods of financial stress, thus contributing to the overall health of the U.S. economy,\" said Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Critics say the rule failed to go far enough and kept taxpayers are risk of having to bail out banks again, should they suffer the kinds of losses incurred during the crisis. \"The rule announced by the Federal Reserve today fails to learn the lesson of the most recent crisis and makes the next crisis - and more bailouts - more likely,\" said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets Inc., a nonprofit bank watchdog group. Under the rule, all banks will need to maintain a level of high-quality capital equal to 4.5 percent of their loans and other assets, weighted by how risky those assets are. A Fed staff memo said that all bank holding companies with more than $10 billion in assets and more than 95 percent of bank holding companies with less than $10 billion in assets would meet the 4.5 percent capital requirement. There is currently a 4 percent requirement for capital but it is not restricted to just high-quality capital, such as bank stock or retained earnings. The nation's 19 largest banks with assets of $250 billion or more will have to start meeting the requirements by Jan. 1. All other banks will have to begin meeting the requirements a year later. The rules will be fully phased in by the end of 2018. The final rule dropped a provision from an earlier draft that required banks to hold higher amounts of capital for mortgage loans judged to be risky. The change was made after the housing industry and smaller community banks argued against this rule. They objected because they said it would restrict mortgage loans at a time when the housing industry was still struggling to recover. \"The smaller banks did ok and the mortgage lobby had its voice heard,\" said Alok Sinha, the head of the banking and securities team at accounting firm Deloitte & Touche. Fed officials also signaled Tuesday that they are considering moving forward on even tougher standards for the nation's largest banks. Fed board member Daniel K. Tarullo said during the discussion that \"we have a number of capital-related initiatives remaining.\" He said there were four rules being considered that would increase capital requirements for eight big banking organizations that have been identified as having global systemic importance.

IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn repeated on Friday that his organization believed the yuan was undervalued.\nChina abolished a yuan peg to the US dollar in 2005 and linked its currency to a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen, euro and the US dollar.\n\"We have an exchange rate setting of a managed float with reference to a basket of currencies and based on a market mechanism,\" Yi said. \"We will continue this mechanism while at the same time maintaining the stability of the market.\"\nA G7 statement in April said: \"We welcome China's continued commitment to move to a more flexible exchange rate, which should lead to continued appreciation of the renminbi in effective terms and help promote more balanced growth in China and in the world economy.\"\nYi also reiterated on Saturday that China had no plans for monetary policy tightening anytime soon.\n\"We will maintain the stability and continuity of monetary policy,\" he said.\nChina's annual economic growth reached 7.9 percent in the second quarter of this year and the latest data has showed strong momentum, raising the possibility of reaching a government-set annual growth rate of 8 percent.\nChinese officials, however, have consistently said the foundation of the recovery is not yet solid.\nThe G7, comprising the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US, has been eclipsed during the financial crisis by the larger Group of 20 (G20), which includes rising powers such as China and India.\nMeeting in Pittsburgh last month, leaders of the G20 agreed in principle to work towards cutting global imbalances and to tighten financial regulation.\n\"The G7 is not quite dead, but it is losing its relevance,\" Strauss-Kahn was quoted as saying by Emerging Markets magazine. \"It's on its way to extinction.\"\nMany officials, while saying the group still had a purpose, conceded that its role would have to change as the G20 took the lead in managing the global recovery.\n\"We have agreed to work on a more informal basis, that we step back to the way it was some years ago, and that we want to try to cut back the schedules for (numbers of) meetings,\" German Deputy Finance Minister Joerg Asmussen said.\nRecovery vulnerable\nThe G7 stressed that the world's economic recovery remained vulnerable to setbacks, despite the IMF's forecasts of growth across much of the G7 and elsewhere in the second half of this year and in 2010.\n\"In recent months we have started to see signs of a global economic recovery and continued improvement in financial market conditions,\" the G7 statement said.\n\"However, there is no room for complacency since the prospects for growth remain fragile and labor market conditions are not yet improving.

Unlike 1997, they are not overburdened with debt, and most have avoided significant layoffs, leaving them in a strong position to expand production as soon as demand returns.\nBut perhaps the most striking trend has been how businesses have streamlined their financial management to cut costs. Producers are taking an in-depth look at their supply chains - not just their tier 1 suppliers, but deep into the second, third and fourth tiers - in a drive to control costs and understand potential vulnerabilities.\nThe preference for connectivity has been amplified by cash-rich Asian businesses looking for competitively priced acquisitions in Europe and the US.\nWe have seen subtle and interesting shifts in acquisition profiles. Asian businesses are still interested in buying Western companies to establish a hold in developed markets and to use their technical advantage to move up the value chain, but they are now also looking for management skills that will assist them to take their business to the next level.\nIf Asian businesses spent 2012 looking inward to cut costs by pursuing greater integration and efficiency, they were also looking outward for new growth opportunities, particularly in other emerging markets - the so-called South-South trade routes.\nChina is leading the charge - overseas direct investment surged more than 25 per cent in the first 10 months of the year to reach USD58 billion. The flow of raw materials from the Middle East, Africa and Latin America to Asia is well-established, but Asian exporters are forging new trade links to provide infrastructure, goods and services to other emerging economies to take advantage of growing disposable incomes.\nThis is part of a long-term shift in the shape of global growth. Our research indicates that 17 of the world's 30 largest economies in 2050 will be what we now regard as emerging markets, and the International Monetary Fund predicts that more than 60 per cent of global GDP growth in the next five years will come from outside the developed world.\nThe continuing uncertainties in Europe and the US have weighed on Asian markets over the past year, but despite these difficulties and the slowdown in China, we are seeing a shift in sentiment, with the green shoots of cautious optimism beginning to emerge. Most importantly, from an Asian perspective, China seems to be back on the road to growth.\nThis year will present its own challenges.

Our guest speaker for the October webcast is Director General for Economic and Financial Affairs, Marco Buti. During this webcast, Mr. Buti will address the following:\nDespite major steps already taken to fight the crisis and address the weak spots of original institutional arrangements, European economies and in particular the euro area remain under pressure, as a result of continuing financial stress, slow growth and the adjustment process to correct pre-crisis imbalances. To respond to these short-term challenges and, on the longer-run, avoid a repetition of the current crisis, action is necessary on a number of different lines.\nLack of confidence of markets in general, and businesses in particular is a major factor in the current economic situation. It is therefore of the utmost importance that countries continue with credible fiscal consolidation increasing the sustainability of public finances. Furthermore, it is crucial to continue work to underpin the stability of the banking sector and prevent further financial fragmentation so that the flow of funds to the economy can be secured.\nMacro-economic and financial stability should be further underpinned by the implementation of ambitious structural reforms. Structural reforms in product, services and labour markets are necessary to improve the way markets function, remove barriers and strengthen the business environment by opening new opportunities and make economies more flexible to facilitate adjustment.\nAlso, to address confidence and mend the weak spots of original institutional arrangements of EMU, further integration is needed. The President of the European Council, in cooperation with the Presidents of the Commission, Eurogroup and the ECB are working on a report on four essential 'building blocks' for further integration: (i) an integrated financial framework, (ii) an integrated budgetary framework, (iii) an integrated economic policy framework and (iv) democratic legitimacy and accountability. An interim report will be presented to the October European Council, the final report to the December European Council. The State of the Union address by President Barroso on 12 September already presented the ambitions of the Commission to work actively in those directions. The Commission will publish a blueprint this autumn to identify the necessary tools and instruments to complete a genuine economic and monetary union.\nThomas Bernt Henriksen\nEconomic Editor B\u00f8rsen Thomas Bernt Henriksen is the Economic Editor of the newspaper B\u00f8rsen and solid economic commentator.

        "webpage": "Home \" Voters are no longer stupid about the economy\nVoters are no longer stupid about the economy\n| By Brad Stamm |\nMichigan's minimum wage and income inequality\nAuto industry no longer can support state's prosperity\n2015 forecast: a new age of wealth and poverty\nTEC (The Executive Committee) Meet and Greet\nPDMA: \"The Naked Brand\" Boldly Invades West Michigan\n25th Anniversary of the ADA Celebration\nIn 1992, James Carville, the political strategist for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign against the incumbent George H.W. Bush, coined the phrase \"the economy, stupid,\" which was later amended to include the word \"it's.\"\nToday, just like in 1992, the economy is still the foremost election issue in the battle for the White House between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. The difference is that most Americans are less na\u00efve  -  less, if you will, 'stupid'  -  and more educated and astute than they were 20 years ago concerning economic theory, principles and issues, all resulting in a substantial increase in \"economic intelligence\" since the early 1990s.\nWhen we hear talk of QE2, we know this is not a reference to the Queen Elizabeth luxury liner but the Federal Reserve policy of quantitative easing, which is a somewhat euphemistic term for printing more money. And few are unaware of the \"fiscal cliff\" we are soon approaching that could be triggered in early 2013 via automatic tax increases and government spending reductions, potentially resulting in another recession unless there is responsible congressional action.\nOne reason for this increased awareness, especially among younger voters, is that 60 percent of states now require either personal finance or economics for high school graduation. (Michigan requires half a year of economics credit.) Thus, young voters have a better understanding of free markets, the role of government, budget deficits and tax policies.\nAnother reason for the increase in \"economic intelligence\" that pertains mostly to adult voters is that more than 4 million individuals have read Steven Levitt's book, \"Freakonomics.\" Granted, the book is three-quarters entertainment and one-quarter economics, dealing with topics such as \"How Is the Ku Klux Klan Like a Group of Real-Estate Agents?\" and \"Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms?\" The book's success can also be loosely connected with the significant increase in the number of students choosing economics as their major in college.\nAccess to online sources of financial and economic information has also been a valuable tutor. The Grand Rapids Press, Mlive.com and Bloomberg.com offer valuable and timely financial and business insights, as do The Wall Street Journal and The Economist.\nThe economy itself has also been our teacher in an experiential way. That is, unemployment, the national debt and poverty have all been harsh teachers, and in many instances the instruction has been one-on-one. When we hear about the current unemployment rates of 7.8 percent nationally, 9.4 percent in Michigan, and 6.9 percent in Grand Rapids, these numbers aren't merely statistics to be bandied about but represent individuals whose contribution to society has been reduced or eliminated and whose self-worth might be challenged. And those who have either stopped looking for work or are underemployed recognize all too well that they aren't included in the 7.8 percent figure but in the larger U6 definition of unemployment, which is around 18 percent of the labor force. These individuals understand how the economy works better than most economists because they know it isn't working for them. And if you are below the poverty line, you don't need to sit in a classroom to understand its impact upon you and your family. In 2011, about 15.9 percent (48.5 million) of the U.S. population had incomes below the poverty level. Michigan has 9.8 percent in poverty (7th worst in the nation), and Grand Rapids 23.4 percent. These voters don't need to be enlightened by politicians or pollsters on their economic status, but have been taught by their personal experience and will vote based on that.\nThis year's election is certainly still very much about the economy, as it was in 1992. However, I believe it needs to be about more than this. That is, while our decisions at the ballot box can and should be to a large degree framed by economic principles, there is a distinct need to be guided inwardly by our personal conviction of right and wrong while anchored outwardly by a view of the world that seeks truth, shows compassion and acts justly. Our decision matrix must also include the important elements of protecting and promoting family, faith and freedom. So while \"economic intelligence\" is on the rise, we should not neglect a commitment to moral literacy and an increased awareness of the spiritual capital that is a necessary foundation for long-term economic prosperity.\nK. Brad Stamm is a professor of economics at Cornerstone University and author of the recently released book, \"Faithonomics: It's the Economy, But You're No Longer Stupid: The Rise of Economic Intelligence.\"\nBrad Stamm\nRecent Articles by Brad Stamm\nAn age of economic uncertainty"

        "webpage": "Practice Excellence Companies Struggle with New Chief Compliance Officer Position\nFinance Careers Aug 5th 2004 0 The overwhelming range of new duties brought on by corporate reform legislation has prompted many companies to create the position of chief compliance officer.\nThe problem is, companies are not always clear on who the chief compliance officer should report to or even what that person should do, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act does not require the new position, but 36 percent of companies now have a chief compliance officer, according to a recent study from market research firm Meta Group. In the pre-Enron era, the chief financial officer usually handled financial compliance work, while other types of compliance fell under the duties of a chief operations officer or were spread throughout the business.\nThe Meta Group found two common problems with how companies handle the new position: too many companies are allowing the CEO to supervise the CCO, and companies are not working on developing a good relationship between the CCO and chief information officer.\nMeta, which surveyed 300 executives, says 45 percent of companies with a CCO have that person reporting to the top executive, which is a bad idea. The CCO would be in an awkward position if the CEO was involved in any compliance problems.\n\"We believe this role should report directly to the board of directors,\" said Meta in its study. CCOs should meet regularly with board members, at a minimum. Only 10 percent of CCOs reported to the chairman or the board; 17 percent reported to the CFO, 13 percent to the chief information officer and 6 percent to legal personnel. And 7 percent of respondents didn't know who their CCO reported to, the study said.Trending\nAnother problem was the lack of coordination between the CCO and the CIO, who can help the CCO understand software used in compliance work.\n\"The chief compliance officer absolutely has to lean on the CIO to understand where the hooks and liabilities are,\" said David Yockelson, a senior vice president at Meta Group.\nThe CIO should create a technology blueprint for compliance functions as various Sarbanes-Oxley requirements require different kind of technology, the Meta Group says. The IT department's compliance is also a major part of a company's overall compliance work, according to the research group.\nTagsFinance"

States Move on Minimum Wage\nWhile Republicans in Congress balk, 19 states have enacted a minimum wage higher than the federal level.\nBy Lorraine Woellert, Bloomberg February 14, 2013\nPresident Barack Obama's proposal to increase the U.S. minimum wage by 24 percent faces long odds in Congress, where Republicans took aim at it minutes after the State of the Union address. That might not matter: beyond Capitol Hill, some states took action long ago.\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already require employers to pay more than the $7.25 an hour required by federal law, according to the U.S. Labor Department. At least eight more, including New York and New Jersey, are considering legislation to join them. On Jan. 1, Washington state, home to the highest minimum wage in the nation, raised its floor to $9.19, more than the $9 an hour proposed by Obama.\nThe patchwork of laws has offered new insight into the effect of higher wages on jobs. Some economists are challenging the traditional precept that as the price of something goes up, demand goes down, at least when it comes to labor.\n\"We've had this natural experiment where states that have raised their minimum wage border states that haven't,\" said Jack Temple, a policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a non-profit worker advocacy group. \"Businesses have adjusted without losing employment.\"\nTemple and others point to two studies that challenge the conventional wisdom that higher wages lead to fewer jobs. The first, a 1994 study by Alan Krueger, now Obama's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, and David Card, director of the Labor Studies Program at the National Bureau of Economic Research, compared fast food eateries in New Jersey and Pennsylvania after New Jersey raised its hourly minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05 in 1992.\n\"The increase in the minimum wage increased employment,\" the two found. For low-wage workers, job prospects actually improved in New Jersey, they concluded.\nThat finding was buttressed in 2010, when a group of economists used a similar approach to compare restaurant workers in neighboring states with different wage limits. The study, authored by a group that included Michael Reich, director for the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, concluded that minimum wage increases did not reduce employment.\nThe findings are at odds with other work, most notably from David Neumark, director of the University of California's Center for Economics and Public Policy in Irvine, who has studied the question with Federal Reserve economist William Wascher.\nTheir 2007 review of academic studies found that \"almost all point to negative employment effects.\"\n\"It's the law of demand,\" said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business, a lobbying group for small employers. \"The higher the price of anything, the less will be taken. That applies to labor.\"\nIn his speech Feb. 12 to a joint session of Congress, Obama proposed raising the hourly federal minimum wage to $9 from $7.25 by the end of 2015. That would return the wage to its highest inflation-adjusted value since 1981, under Republican President Ronald Reagan, according to the White House.\nEchoing Dunkelberg, House Speaker John Boehner dismissed the idea yesterday.\n\"When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it,\" the Ohio Republican told reporters. \"Why do we want to make it harder for small employers to hire p"

(AP)  -  Connecticut's comptroller is demanding more information be made public about hundreds of millions of dollars in state tax assistance to businesses, sparking debate among lawmakers about how much taxpayers are entitled to know about how their money is being spent.Comptroller Kevin Lembo is pushing legislation that would give the public access to information including how much state money went toward tax credits and other state aid, the number of jobs created and the purpose of the economic help.\"We don't always look at what kind of return on investment we get on economic development,\" he said. \"Transparency around this issue is important.\"Business lobbyists insisted on legislation that would require less detailed information from companies.The Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee voted 44-5 on April 12 to approve compromise legislation that addressed some concerns from business lobbyists that companies would be forced to disclose too many details, such as tax data that would help rivals. The bill, which is now awaiting action in the House of Representatives, would allow information to be gathered according to industry rather than specific companies.Bonnie Stewart, a lobbyist for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state's largest business group, said the legislation is improved but could do more to protect businesses from being forced to provide proprietary information. Broader industry groupings would help, she said.Republican Rep. Vin Candelora, who voted against the legislation, said businesses might refuse to seek economic assistance from the state if forced to disclose proprietary information in the name of transparency. The result would be reduced economic activity.\"I think maybe the bigger question is whether government should be involved in these programs at all,\" he said.The legislation has sparked at least the second battle in this year's legislative session over state economic development aid. Unions and their allies are pushing for separate legislation that would require businesses receiving $500,000 or more in economic development aid to pay wages and benefits higher than the minimum for janitors, guards and other service workers.Candelora said differences over state aid to business are tied to Connecticut's weak economic recovery, persistently high unemployment and tight state revenue.\"There are more arguments over how to prioritize,\" he said. \"We're seeing a greater fight over the philosophy of how to spend money.\"Connecticut is one of many states that offer financial help to companies to spur job creation or other business activity. Employers can take credits on taxes for hiring, buying machinery and equipment, creating jobs, spending money on research and development, and doing business at a specified urban industrial site.Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has promoted economic development programs to attract large companies such as Cigna, NBC Sports and ESPN that the state says spurred $561.3 million in investment in the budget year that ended last June 30. State tax credits totaled $75 million, and state investments, including loans and grants, were nearly $110 million.A small-business program also assisted nearly 150 businesses with $20.7 million in loans and matching grants in 2012, the state says.Catherine Smith, economic development commissioner, said lawmakers must avoid jeopardizing Connecticut's ability to lure more businesses by forcing companies to disclose private information. Employers would refuse, halting job creation efforts in Connecticut, she said.\"We are finally getting Connecticut back on the map in getting companies interested in the state,\" she said. \"We have a shot at getting companies out of Manhattan. I don't think we've had that shot in the past.\"Lembo, who had earlier said aggregate information was insufficient to determine if public money was getting the \"most bang for the buck,\" welcomed the compromise legislation.\"The current bill still moves us in the right direction,\" he said. If the intent of the legislation is to give lawmakers better information, \"this will give them a ton of information.\"\nBritain's World War II-era Prime Minister Winston Churchill's portrait will be featured on a new 5-pound note in 2016.

        "webpage": "Evidence on the Costs and Benefits of Economic Sanctions\nby Kimberly Ann Elliott, Peterson Institute for International Economics\nSpeech given before the Subcommittee on Trade Committee on Ways and MeansUnited States House of RepresentativesWashington, DC\nA nation that is boycotted is a nation that is in sight of surrender. Apply this economic, peaceful, silent, deadly remedy and there will be no need for force. It does not cost a life outside the nation boycotted, but it brings a pressure upon the nation which, in my judgment, no modern nation could resist.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, 19191\nThe reality, alas, has been far different from what President Wilson envisioned. The global, comprehensive, and vigorously enforced sanctions against Iraq and the former Yugoslavia have produced at best limited and tenuous results. Unilateral sanctions - even when imposed by the largest economy in the world - face far more difficult challenges, especially in an increasingly integrated international economy. Even against such small and vulnerable targets as Haiti and Panama, military force eventually was required to achieve American goals.\nExtensive empirical research on the effectiveness of economic sanctions throughout this century suggests that these two cases are not unusual. Since 1970, unilateral US sanctions have achieved foreign policy goals in only 13 percent of the cases where they have been imposed. In addition to whatever effect repeated failure may have on the credibility of US leadership, other recent research suggests that economic sanctions are costing the United States $15 billion to $19 billion annually in potential exports. This, in turn, translates into 200,000 or more jobs lost in the relatively highly compensated export sector.2\nPotential Benefits of Sanctions as a Foreign Policy Tool\nThe Institute's research program on economic sanctions began in the early 1980s, in the wake of the grain embargo, imposed in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the pipeline sanctions, imposed in response to the Soviet role in the Polish crackdown on the Solidarity trade union. The conventional wisdom then was that sanctions never work, that they are costly politically and economically, and that their use should be constrained.\nOur research addresses these issues empirically, through assessment of the outcomes in 115 cases of economic sanctions beginning with World War I and ending in 1990. In addition to assessing outcomes, our research also identifies the conditions under which sanctions are most likely to achieve foreign policy goals.\nWe judged 35 percent of these cases to be at least partially successful and concluded that sanctions are most likely to be effective when:\nThe goal is relatively modest. This also lessens the importance of multilateral cooperation, which often is difficult to obtain.\nThe target country is much smaller than the country imposing sanctions, economically weak, and politically unstable. (The average sanctioner's economy was 187 times larger than that of the average target.)\nThe sanctioner and target are friendly toward one another prior to the imposition of sanctions and conduct substantial trade. The sanctioner accounted for 28 percent of the average target's trade in success cases but only 19 percent in failures.\nThe sanctions are imposed quickly and decisively to maximize impact. The average cost to the target as a percentage of GNP in success cases was 2.4 percent and 1 percent in failures.\nThe sanctioning country avoids high costs to itself.\nOur forthcoming third edition will extend this dataset by roughly another 30 to 40 cases. Although the results to date are preliminary, we do not expect these conclusions to change significantly.\nOf the 115 cases studied, the United States was a participant in 78, usually as the leading sanctioner and often alone. The results for US sanctions are broadly similar to those described above because the United States has been the dominant user of economic sanctions. Thus, the 33 percent success rate for US sanctions was virtually identical to that for the sample as a whole.\nA striking result of our analysis, however, is the declining utility of US economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool, especially when they are unilateral (see table 1). Prior to the 1970s, sanctions in which the United States was involved, either alone or with others, succeeded at least partially just over 50 percent of the time. Between 1970 and 1990, however, US sanctions succeeded in just 21 percent of the cases initiated.\nThe results for unilateral US sanctions, those in which American policymakers received either no or only minor cooperation from other countries, are even more striking. In 55 post-war episodes, the success rate for such cases was only slightly below that for all cases involving the United States, 29 percent versus 33 percent. However, more than two-thirds of those successes o"

        "webpage": "'Bankers' New Clothes' Leave Too Little Skin In The Game By NPR Staff\nAnat Admati is a professor of finance and economics at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.\nAt a hearing in Washington on March 6, Attorney General Eric Holder admitted to senators why it has been hard to go after big bank executives: \"It does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy. And I think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large.\" The comment might be startling in Washington: Regulators recently gave a thumbs-up to nearly all of the big banks, after testing their ability to withstand another crisis. But Holder's less-than optimistic remarks come as no surprise to Stanford finance professor Anat Admati. She's co-author of a new book called The Banker's New Clothes, and she shares Holder's concern about overly large banks. But Admati emphasizes another problem: how much debt banks have. Banks can borrow cheaply, thanks to government guarantees, so they load up on debt. Admati says that heavy reliance on borrowed funds makes the banking system dangerously fragile. She joins NPR's Renee Montagne to explain why banks borrow more than they should, how new regulations aren't tough enough and how less government support would lead to a stronger economy.Interview Highlights On Eric Holder's claim that it's challenging to prosecute banks \"He was saying that the banks are too large, but the issue is really: Why would there be this negative effect on the world economy if he prosecutes them? And that's because they would somehow fail, or get distressed. And why does that happen? That happens when you borrow too much. So it's not about 'too big to fail,' but it's about the likelihood of failing, which is the likelihood of being, somehow having difficulty paying your debt, just like homeowners might when they have very little down payment or equity in their house. And for other companies, we don't regulate how much they borrow, and yet they don't borrow very much  -  not as much as banks  -  even though we allow them to. And so the banks just like to borrow, but as they do that they put all of us at excessive risk and danger.\" On the problems of excessive borrowing and the use of complex financial instruments \"It manifests itself in these instruments because they allow the banks to use all kinds of tricks to borrow more and to hide all the risk in borrowing that happens. And so they can manipulate the regulation and they can actually be riskier than they appear, and all of this is just living on the edge and not being prepared enough, with your own money, indeed, to various eventualities, to what might happen.\" On new regulations and banks' resistance to carrying more equity \"So the requirements now, which the regulators will tell you are so tough, actually still allow the banks to use borrowed money for 97 percent of their investment and have just 3 percent equity, so even if it's a little bit, just a little bit more of a buffer, it's still not a healthy place to be. ... \"If they find that they cannot live with much more equity, then we have to wonder about their business model and the viability of having such a banking system that possibly is quite bloated and is distorting the rest of the economy. If the only way they can live is on subsidized borrowing, then we have to be concerned about why that is.\" On what would make the banking system more stable \"Well, I would definitely want to move to a system in which the banks have a lot more skin in the game, are funding themselves with a much healthier mix of debt and equity, and to transition to that system shouldn't take very long. The banks that cannot raise new equity are showing us a great weakness, and some banks might be too weak to exist, and the time to take care of that is now and not in a crisis. ... \"I would like them to build up and maintain their ability to withstand losses through a much, much healthier range so that we deliver to the public a stable and healthy system that can make loans and that can do everything that we need it to do, and without being so distorted and dangerous. \"I think the banks should be made to be less dependent on supports. ... The government needs to make sure that they are safer on their own, because their support allows them to have better terms for borrowing, and that's unfair to the rest of the economy.\"Copyright 2013 NPR.

I submit, in my capacity as Chairman of the EU Council of Economic and Finance Ministers, this statement which focuses on: recent economic developments and policies in the context of a specific geopolitical situation; crisis prevention and resolution, including the two-track approach to sovereign debt restructuring; issues related to developing countries, including their voice in the IMF, and HIPC; and the fight against the abuses of the international financial system.\n2. This meeting is being held at a time of heightened macro-economic, financial and geopolitical uncertainty. The war in Iraq and the related further geopolitical tensions make it all the more necessary to promote sound macroeconomic policies, to implement the necessary structural reforms in our economies, and to strengthen the multilateral framework for international trade, finance and development.\nEconomic situation and outlook\n3. On the whole, the recovery of the global economy is weaker than expected one year ago. In addition, the global economic outlook is being clouded by geopolitical tensions that may affect further the level and volatility of oil and equity prices, and could more generally have a strong impact on confidence, of both consumers and businesses. Other issues of concern include issues related to financial stability, and the imbalances between and within the major economic areas. Addressing these issues calls for continued vigilance and co-operation at both the regional and the multilateral level.\n4. The recovery is underpinned by a number of forces, notably the supportive macroeconomic policies in the advanced economies. The pattern of growth, in the face of the global slowdown and associated shocks, has been uneven in both developed and developing countries and the resilience to these shocks has also differed significantly across countries. Against this background, it is especially important to address the consequences of the global slowdown for developing countries, including the poorest ones. The EU and the euro area\n5. Economic growth in the euro area has turned out to be weaker than anticipated. However, EU economies remain resilient. The response of economic policy-notably through the work of automatic stabilizers and the support of monetary policy-and sound and stable fundamentals, together with good inflation prospects over the medium term, should provide the platform for the recovery to gather strength during the second half of the year, with growth expected to return to potential next year. However, as in any other economic area, the outlook is clouded by economic uncertainties and global political risks. 6. In the current environment, economic policies in the EU will be oriented towards the restoration of confidence and economic growth by a determined implementation of the agreed economic policy strategy. Macroeconomic policies in the EU and the euro area are designed to restore non-inflationary economic growth in a context of less supportive global economic conditions. Budgetary policies continue to be geared to maintaining or achieving public finances close to balance or in surplus in the medium run, while supporting growth by letting the automatic stabilizers work symmetrically over the cycle within the framework of the SGP. Greater attention will be paid also to the longer-term sustainability and quality of public finances to meet the challenges of an a"

Times Are Good for Risk Managers\nInsurance prices are generally favorable, and terms and conditions have liberalized in the property/casualty market.\nBy Russ Banham, PropertyCasualty360 February 10, 2014 \u2022 Reprints\nPrices are holding steady for corporate buyers of casualty insurance products, and in cases where the loss experience has been particularly good, the premiums have fallen. On the property insurance side of the industry, it's a buyer's market, with prices falling at a quick clip. And in both industry houses, insurers eager to maintain market share are open to altering policy coverage terms and conditions.\nThese are just some of the enticing tidbits risk managers can anticipate as they head into the annual April policy renewal season. While not all companies renew their policies in the springtime, most do. Unlike past market encounters, this go-round promises good deals along with the sunshine and flowers.\nMany carriers, for instance, are open to writing casualty primary and excess lines of coverage in occurrence-based policies instead of less favorable claims-made formats. Additionally, multiyear transactions are available in property, new sources of private flood insurance capacity have opened up, and even terrorism-related coverage in many policies are there for the taking at little to no cost.\nThe future bodes even better, with 92 percent of insurance company CEOs in a survey by PwC expressing confidence that their revenues will increase over the next three years, provided not by increasing premiums but through technological advances, particularly the impact of data analytics on underwriting.\nGood Deals Galore\nAll in all, it's not only a good time to be a risk manager, it's about time, too. Four years ago in Treasury & Risk magazine, an article on risk managers began: \"They're frightened, they're angry, and they're sleepless.\" The title of the article was instructive: \"Dreaming of Better Days Ahead.\"\nThose days appear to have arrived. \"The property/casualty market is softening, apparently faster than we had predicted in October [2013]\" said Matt Keeping, chief placement officer at insurance broker Willis North America. \"At that time, we were suggesting that rates in the property, non-catastrophe market would be down 10 to 12 percent and the catastrophe market down 5 to 10 percent. There's been a bit of a change, with reductions now in the 15 to 20 percent range for non-catastrophe and in the 5 to 20 percent range for catastrophe. Things are accelerating.\"\nThe news is less bullish on the casualty side, but nonetheless upbeat. \"We estimate that average rates are tight around the zero mark, with a slight plus or minus,\" said Steve Kempsey, U.S. casualty leader at insurance broker Marsh. \"Rates essentially stabilized in 2013, although the guaranteed workers' compensation line is still difficult. Nevertheless, insurers are more willing than in the past couple years to be flexible. ... They're more apt to negotiate on renewals.\"\nHe notes that a company \"in a desirable risk class with a differentiating risk profile can still see a good premium reduction.\"\nRobert Hartwig, president and chief economist at the New York-based Insurance Information Institute, agrees that the market is softening in property, but less so for casualty business. \"I'd say prices are holding the line, depending on how aggressive the insurer is to acquire and/or retain business,\" Hartwig said. \"Nevertheless, this is an improvement over where we were a year ago.\"\nWhat accounts for this improving picture? The primary factor is a flood of capacity coming into the reinsurance markets, giving primary insurers more leeway to lay off assumed risks. For example, Everest Re's special purpose reinsurer, Mt. Logan Re, Ltd., secured additional funding in January, bringing its current committed capital to $370 million, well in excess of the initial target of $250 million. The special purpose reinsurance facility was formed last year to provide collateralized capacity to the global property catastrophe reinsurance market.\nSuch non-traditional reinsurance capacity, in addition to a lack of major U.S. catastrophe losses in 2013, have combined to lower reinsurance rates for primary insurers, which is now trickling down to soften commercial pricing. \"Everyone benefits when you've got a record level of reinsurance capacity, which is the case right now,\" said Keeping. \"And the spigot remains open.\" Additional sources of non-traditional capacity are flowing in from private equity, hedge funds, and pension funds, he explains.\nThis non-traditional capacity also is eviden"

(Read the paper, What to Expect When You're Electing,\" here.) Watch the FedIn particular, the authors said \"equity investors, especially those that target small-cap stocks, would be wise to monitor Fed policy actions, while paying limited attention to the party of the president.\" Consider: The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index SPX, -0.13%\nwas 11.7% higher and the U.S. small-cap index was 25.63% higher during expansive periods vs. restrictive periods. \"Clearly, the equity markets have prospered during periods when the Fed has maintained an expansive monetary policy stance,\" wrote the authors of the study.As for how you might invest now given the Fed's current policy stance, Johnson offered this: The Fed's current policy stance is neither restrictive nor expansive. \"It's almost indeterminate right now,\" Johnson said in an interview. \"The Fed has been giving mixed signals. You certainly can't say it's been a restrictive monetary policy given all the easing but if you look at our long-term and short-term indicators they have been at odds.\"According to Johnson, the study combined two metrics to capture the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The first metric is based on changes in the federal funds rate. This metric adjusts for \"Fed stringency\" in the short-term market. And the second metric is based on changes in the Fed discount rate. This metric captures fundamental long-term shifts in overall monetary policy. \"Using both variables more accurately assesses whether the Fed is pursuing an expansive or restrictive monetary policy,\" Johnson and his co-authors wrote.In effect, if the fed funds rate falls month to month, the stringency metric is considered expansive; if the fed funds rate increases month over month, stringency is considered restrictive. Changes in the discount rate are used in a comparable fashion and identify fundamental shifts in the Fed's monetary policy stance, the authors wrote. At the moment, the indicators are not giving a clear sense of the Fed's policy. But one thing seems certain to Johnson. \"There is a very high probability that the Fed will be much more restrictive in the future,\" he said.The authors also said Fed policy shifts should be viewed as potential signals of coming inflationary pressures. \"A shift to a restrictive policy stance should alert investors to higher future inflation and support a reallocation to securities that offer more inflation protection, such as commodities and TIPS,\" they wrote.Before you start selling your stocks though, consider this. A restrictive policy might bode well or poorly depending on 1) the political environment - whether there's political harmony or gridlock in Washington, D.C. -  and 2) the political party of the next president. Assuming the Fed maintains a restrictive monetary policy and assuming gridlock in Congress (and it is safe to assume this), whether you over- or underweight large-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, corporate bonds, Treasury bills or TIPS will depend on the political party of the next President, said Johnson. Johnson also suggested that investors use the table to make small tactical adjustments to their portfolio, rather than major adjustments."

        "webpage": "Guaranteeing Lower Borrowing Costs For Big Banks\nDaniel Indiviglio Nov 6 2009, 1:59 PM ET\nAs a part of the bank bailout, the government slapped federal guarantees on hundreds of billions of dollars in bonds issued by banks. This was above and beyond the direct capital infusions. The move was meant to calm investor fears in the banks' assets and provide more private capital to the struggling financial institutions. It worked, and they were seen as safer. Investors viewed them as so healthy, in fact, that big banks saved a great deal of money in borrowing costs. But the New York Times reports that a Congressional panel thinks this is a fishy situation. I find that reaction puzzling.Here's why the panel found so appalling: One of the federal government's most opaque methods for bailing out the banking system allowed a handful of giant institutions to save up to $25 billion on their borrowing costs, a Congressional panel estimated on Friday.Seven companies received about 82 percent of those benefits, the panel estimated. General Electric Capital was able to reduce its borrowing costs by about $1.9 billion, while Goldman Sachs saved an estimated $606 million. The other big beneficiaries were Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Company.Okay, there are two potential objections to this. The first is that the cheaper borrowing costs were provided to so few firms. That, unfortunately, is just pure logistics. These eight firms were much larger, so had much higher borrowing costs to begin with. They also had a lot more of the securities that needed guaranteeing than smaller banks. So I'm not sure how this problem was avoidable, given the government desire to protect the financial system and not let giant banks fail. This really just boils down to a dislike of having firms that are too big to fail, which is hardly a new concern. The second objection might be that banks received lower borrowing costs at all. This, however, is also kind of a strange complaint. This result should be neither shocking nor worrying. The entire purpose of guaranteeing bonds was to make sure the investment community felt better about the banks, and thus, provided cheaper capital in the form of debt or equity. The end that the panel is complaining about is exactly what was aimed for. The Times goes on to explain that these guarantees have actually worked out pretty well for the government so far: The good news for taxpayers, the panel said, is that the government has actually turned a profit thus far on the guarantees. The government has collected $9 billion in fees for guaranteeing bonds issued by the big financial institutions and a total of $17 billion in fees for all its emergency guarantees. Thus far, it has lost only about $2 million.That's like making a $2 investment and getting paid $17,000 in return. That's not exactly how I'd define a poor investment. I generally agree with the view that guarantees can be very dangerous, but so far, they've turned out just fine. There probably won't be many future losses from banks either. Unless Citi and/or Bank of America fail, I can't see the bank bailouts costing more than what the government has already collected. (Remember: AIG, GM and Chrysler are not banks.) Of course, the jury is still partially out on how large a bill the taxpayers will be left with thanks to the bank bailouts, but so far so good. And unless that changes, I can't see lamenting the use of guarantees just because they lowered banks' borrowing costs, as anticipated.\nNoah Berlatsky 2:45 PM ET Will Free Online Courses Ever Replace a College Education?\nBenjamin Winterhalter 11:08 AM ET In 1858, People Said the Telegraph Was 'Too Fast for the Truth'"

Stanley Fischer. Frenkel must be approved by a committee headed by Judge Yaakov Turkel, and then the full Israeli cabinet.In his previous term as BoI governor, Frenkel - an Israel Prize winner who currently serves as chairman of JPMorgan International - was credited with bringing Israeli inflation down to levels of other Western economies and liberalizing its financial markets and foreign exchange regime.\nBe the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Fischer himself has credited Frenkel's achievements in the past.\"I make special mention of the then-governor Prof. Jacob Frenkel, [who] succeeded in pushing the changes through, and the economy is currently enjoying the fruits of that success, and it can certainly be stated that it provided the very important infrastructure for the excellent situation of the economy today,\" Fischer said in a 2007 speech.Fischer announced in January that he would step down from his position on June 30, after eight years as governor. Until Frenkel is approved, Fischer's deputy, Karnit Flug, whose name had also been floated to fill the position, will serve as acting governor.Yet the Bank of Israel Frenkel returns to will not be the same one he left. Fischer made a point to effect institutional change at the bank, making it more professional and bringing it in line with international central banking standards. In 2010, the Knesset passed a new Bank of Israel Law, which gave the bank more independence, installed a seven-person committee to make its primary interest rate decisions, and made those decisions more transparent.How Frenkel's views will have evolved since his last term, how he will interact with the new banking structures and what lessons he has drawn from the financial crisis may mean his new stint at BoI will be markedly different from his previous tenure.But those changes aside, Israeli markets are likely to welcome the news that Frenkel, a known quantity who is just as much the \"responsible adult\" as Fischer, is coming back into the position.\"This is a surprising and positive development for the Israeli economy,\" the Halman-Aldubi investment group said in response to the announcement. \"It's important to note that the problems the economy faces today are totally different than those Prof. Frenkel dealt with in his previous term. The biggest problem today is slowed growth. [Frenkel] was known in his time as having fought inflation, even at the expense of growth.\"In his new term, the investment house said, he would have to lead a more expansionary policy, or risk recession.According to a Bloomberg analysis, Fischer was a master of surprise. \"The Fischer-led Bank of Israel has surprised economists in about a quarter of its rate decisions, more often than any other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development country for which comparable data is tracked by Bloomberg,\" analysts wrote in January, saying Fischer's outlook resembled the US Fed's emphasis on growth and employment more than the European Central Bank's focus on inflation.But not everyone was happy with the choice.MK Nachman Shai (Labor) said the decision proved that, despite Frenkel's previous achievements, Netanyahu \"is unable to think outside the box. What has been is what will be.\"Earlier in June, Netanyahu hinted that he was seeking to replace Fischer with a candidate residing abroad, saying at a Likud Beytenu faction meeting that his next nominee would \"continue the impressive list of Frenkel and Fischer\" - the two governors who had been plucked from international positions to fill the role.Frenkel, of course, fully fits the criteria.Last week, Globes reported that Netanyahu was trying to enlist Elhanan Helpman, a Harvard professor who was educated and had taught in Israel, and had also been sought out in 2005, when the post was ultimately offered to Fischer.Aside from his time at the Bank of Israel and JPMorgan, Frenkel was also chairman of the board of the NGO Group of 30 (G30), vice chairman of insurance giant AIG, and chairman of Merrill Lynch International. Before his first BoI term, he studied at the Hebrew University and University of Chicago, and was director of research at the International Monetary Fund.\nshekel"

        "webpage": "Click here to get the RSS Feed! Uncertainty, Unemployment, and Inflation\nby Guest Author - September 21st, 2012, 6:00am\nHeightened uncertainty acts like a decline in aggregate demand because it depresses economic activity and holds down inflation. Policymakers typically try to counter uncertainty's economic effects by easing the stance of monetary policy. But, in the recent recession and recovery, nominal interest rates have been near zero and couldn't be lowered further. Consequently, uncertainty has reduced economic activity more than in previous recessions. Higher uncertainty is estimated to have lifted the U.S. unemployment rate by at least one percentage point since early 2008.\nThe U.S. economy has slowed substantially in recent months. Many commentators argue that uncertainty about future economic conditions has been an important factor behind the tepid recovery. According to a recent New York Times article, \"A rising number of manufacturers are canceling new investments and putting off new hires because they fear paralysis in Washington will force hundreds of billions in tax increases and budget cuts in January, undermining economic growth.\" However, evidence supporting this view is scant. In a 2011 Wall Street Journal interview, University of Chicago economist Robert E. Lucas, Jr., said he had \"plenty of suspicion, but little evidence\" that uncertainty was holding back the recovery.\nIn this Economic Letter, we examine the economic effects of uncertainty using a statistical approach. We provide evidence that uncertainty harms economic activity, with effects similar to a decline in aggregate demand. The private sector responds to rising uncertainty by cutting back spending, leading to a rise in unemployment and reductions in both output and inflation. We also show that monetary policymakers typically try to mitigate uncertainty's adverse effects the same way they respond to a fall in aggregate demand, by lowering nominal short-term interest rates.\nOur statistical model suggests that uncertainty has pushed the unemployment rate up at least one percentage point in the past three years. By contrast, uncertainty was not an important factor in the unemployment surge during the deep downturn of 1981-82. One possible reason why uncertainty has weighed more heavily on the economy in the recent recession and recovery is that monetary policy has been limited by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Because nominal rates cannot go significantly lower than their current near-zero level, policy is less able to counteract uncertainty's negative economic effects.\nThe demand effects of uncertainty\nWe use data from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers in the United States and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Industrial Trends Survey in the United Kingdom to measure the perceived uncertainty of consumers and businesses. Since 1978, the Michigan survey has polled respondents each month on whether they expect an \"uncertain future\" to affect their spending on durable goods, such as motor vehicles, over the coming year. Figure 1 plots the percentage of consumers who say they expect uncertainty to affect their spending. The figure also tracks the VIX index, a measure of the volatility of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The VIX index is a standard gauge of uncertainty in the economics literature (see Bloom 2009). The consumer uncertainty sample goes from January 1978 to November 2011, the latest month for which we have data. The VIX sample begins in January 1990 and ends in June 2012.\nFigure 1 shows that both the VIX index and consumer uncertainty are countercyclical, rising in recessions and falling in expansions. For example, both measures of uncertainty surged in 2008 and 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis. However, they do not always track each other. The 1997 East Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian debt crisis led to large spikes in the VIX, but did not have much impact on consumers' perceived uncertainty. It is possible that U.S. consumers paid less attention to financial developments in emerging markets during that period.\nTo study the macroeconomic effects of changes in uncertainty, we use a statistical model that includes consumers' perceived uncertainty, the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, and the three-month Treasury bill rate. We measure inflation as the 12-month percentage change in the consumer price index. All macroeconomic data are seasonally adjusted. The sample goes from January 1978 to November 2011, matching the Michigan survey sample.\nIsolating the effects of uncertainty on the economy is difficult. As Figure 1 shows, uncertainty fluctuates with the business cycle, typically falling in expansions and rising in recessions. To identify the effects of uncertainty, we take advantage of the timing of the survey interviews relative to the timing of macroeconomic data releases (see Leduc and Sill 2010 and Leduc, Sill, and Stark 2007). For example, in the Michigan survey, telephone interviews in a given month are typically conducted before that month's macroeconomic data are released. Survey respondents do not have information about current macroeconomic conditions when they participate in the interviews. Therefore, movements in perceived uncertainty are probably not driven by concurrent economic conditions (see Leduc and Liu 2012).\nWe use the timing difference between the survey and data releases to build what might be thought of as a small statistical laboratory. This allows us to measure how, all else equal, an unexpected increase in uncertainty would affect unemployment, inflation, and the nominal interest rate. We compare the result with the situation in which there is no disturbance to uncertainty. As the effects of the unexpected i"

But does that reflect a fast-strengthening economy? Or is the rate falling only because so many people are dropping out of the workforce? In coming weeks, members of Congress and the Federal Reserve Board will be making big policy decisions based upon their best understanding of those unsettled questions. \"The problem is that there are multiple possible explanations\" for why the jobless rate has been falling since 2009, said Ann Owen, a former Fed economist who now teaches at Hamilton College. \"There's no one thing that ties it all up\" and makes it absolutely clear what is happening. Even though their understanding of the job market's health may be incomplete, policymakers must make judgments. Here are just two issues hanging in the balance: Interest rates. The Federal Reserve said in 2012 that it would allow interest rates to rise once the jobless rate fell to 6.5 percent. But as the magic 6.5 percent level draws closer, many people fear the economy is still far too weak to handle higher rates, which would make homes, cars and other purchases less affordable. Extended unemployment benefits. Democrats plan to push Congress to renew extended unemployment benefits. Many Republicans say that emergency measure, first approved in 2008, is no longer needed. But is it? As economists sift through the data, these are agreed-upon facts: In 2007, 66 percent of Americans over age 16 either had a job or were looking for one. Today, that is down to 62.8 percent, the lowest labor-force participation rate since 1978. When fewer people are in the job market, the unemployment rate can look better. In the past year, the unemployment rate has plunged from 7.9 percent to 6.7 percent. In December, employers added just 74,000 jobs. But the unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a percentage point as 347,000 people left the labor market. These are some leading theories to explain the falling jobless rate: Baby boomers are retiring. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago says that except for an uptick during the housing boom, the labor force has been shrinking for a decade because boomers are aging out of the workforce. Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, made the labor-force participation rate soar in the 1980s, especially as women started working. Now we are seeing the predictable reversal of that trend, which would have played out no matter what economic policies had prevailed in recent years. Many economists say retirements are causing about half of the labor force shrinkage. Others say it's 60 percent, and yet others believe it's more like 40 percent. More people are claiming disability. An economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia says the labor force has been shrinking in part because of soaring Social Security disability claims. And those disabled people are as lost to employers as the retirees. \"The likelihood of those who left the labor force due to retirement or disability rejoining the labor force is small,\" Shigeru Fujita wrote. Young people are studying longer. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago study also concluded that \"there has been a long-running downward shift in teen work activity.\" In other words, back when factories offered good opportunities to 18-year-old workers, many went for the paychecks. Now young people are more likely to keep studying or taking unpaid internships. Many economists say that while those three demographic trends have truth to them, they are far from the whole story. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta notes that the number of prime-age workers  -  ages 25 to 54  -  is continuing to fall. And others point out: People 55 and older have actually been participating at a slightly higher rate since the recession began. Still others argue that a key problem is changing the nature of work. They say the Labor Department is not capturing changes in the modern economy while using its traditional survey questions. In a digital age, many of the \"missing\" prime-age workers may well be earning money, but as freelancers or in ways that fall into gray areas of the economy  -  like doing remote work for overseas employers, but only a couple of times a year. This past fall, Wells Fargo Economics Group released an analysis saying government data are failing to measure the digital workforce, where many people take on paid tasks as software developers, editors or Web designers but don't show up as officially employed. \"Simply stated, the labor market of the 21st century is quite different than in the past,\" the report concluded.Copyright 2014 NPR.

Scott\nJobs, jobs, jobs; they don't just drop from heaven. It takes a lot of work here on earth to build them up and then keep them.\nTo that end, local economic development professionals have different programs and initiatives in place to attract jobs and improve retention. \"I can tell you it's not only Berks Economic Partnership, but also the core economic development groups that are focusing now on retention of jobs and growth,\" said Jon C. Scott, president of Berks Economic Partnership.\nScott said BEP has been working with an outside facilitator to develop a very specialized program for expansion and growth to keep BEP on track.\n\"Our retention efforts on 10 projects have resulted in north of 670 jobs in the past year,\" Scott said. \"That's over a 40 percent - 43 to 44 percent - retention rate. A couple of years ago, it was 30 to 33 percent.\"\nThe efforts include reaching out to companies that may need incremental support or are looking for a different location to expand, he said.\nThere are many reasons why a company might, among them changes at the corporate level, change in ownership and a decision to give up on an aging plant, as when Glidden Co. closed its Bern Street plant.\nOften these decisions are made 24 to 36 months ahead of time in a boardroom far from Reading, and by the time local economic development officials find out, it's too late to change anyone's minds, Scott said.\n\"This is not just happening in Reading,\" Scott said. \"We'll continue to reach out as much as we can.\"\nScott said that right now, BEP is working on a project in which Reading is the only community in Pennsylvania in the running as a possible location for a large employer which could bring in hundreds of jobs.

        "webpage": "Long-term fiscal health needs cuts, taxes: experts\nby Yumi Wijers-Hasegawa\nJun 28, 2006 Article history\nOnline: Jun 28, 2006\nPrint: Jun 28, 2006\nMonday's decision by the government to cut spending and aim for a primary surplus by 2011 is a step in the right direction, but more drastic reforms are needed to whip the books back into shape, experts say.\nThe government and the ruling coalition agreed to cut spending by 11.4 trillion yen to 14.3 trillion yen over the next five years. The cuts, which include slashing the social security budget by 1.6 trillion yen, are estimated to cover more than 70 percent of the 16.5 trillion yen shortfall the government believes it must find to achieve a primary surplus in the combined central and local government budget by 2011.\nA primary surplus excludes the cost of interest payments on government debt and new debt issues.\nNaoki Iizuka, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc., said that although the spending cuts are a good move, a more fundamental reform of the social security system is necessary. \"I assume the cut in social security costs will come from money allocated to the elderly, such as medical care and pension (spending). But with the aging of society, social security costs are snowballing,\" he said. \"If the government really wants to do something about the debt and . . . the low birthrate, the social security scheme needs to be fundamentally changed to shift money to youth, for example, in the form of child care or education.\"\nAmong other spending reductions, 2.6 trillion yen will be pared by reducing the number of civil servants, and an additional 3.9 trillion yen to 5.6 trillion yen is to come from reduced public works spending, according to Monday's announcement.\nThe remaining shortfall of 2.2 trillion yen to 5.1 trillion yen will have to be made up by raising taxes. If the consumption tax is to plug the hole, it would have to go up by 1 to 2 percentage points.\nHowever, with an election coming soon, the ruling coalition is reluctant to raise taxes and it would like to hold cuts in local government grants to a minimum.\nA consumption tax hike is unlikely to be mentioned in the government's 2006 economic policy guidelines, scheduled to be adopted next month by the Cabinet.\nStill, a document issued by the ministry Monday said the consumption tax could be used as \"a source to cover social security costs.\"\nWhen asked about the social security issue, Kaoru Yosano, state minister in charge of economic and fiscal affairs, declined to give specifics.\n\"The ruling party decided last year to consider reform of the entire taxation policy, including the consumption tax,\" he said.\nIizuka of Dai-ichi Life said a modest rise of 1 to 2 points in the consumption tax appears to be enough to meet the 2011 budget surplus target, but a bigger hike will be necessary if the government wants to clear its huge debts.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2006, the combined long-term debt for the central and local governments is expected to reach some 775 trillion yen. Iizuka said with such a colossal debt, equivalent to 1.5 times GDP, the fiscal instability will increase as interest rates rise.\nEven now, with rock-bottom interest rates, the central government spends 18.7 trillion yen, or 23.5 percent of all spending, on debt financing.\nBut over the short term, Iizuka said now is a good time to move workers from the public to the private sector as the economic recovery takes hold.\n\"Many big companies are booming and there are lots of jobs available. By accelerating the shift in manpower from civil servants to private companies, tax revenue will rise, and such a drastic tax hike may not be necessary anymore,\" Iizuka said.\nMasaru Takagi, a professor of economics at Meiji University, stressed the need for the government to overhaul the ailing social security system.\nBut for the upcoming budget, apart from the main issues such as cuts in public works projects, Takagi said official development assistance, for example, should be curtailed.\n\"Japan cannot afford to give so much abroad when it has gone totally broke in financing its own (spending).\""

Garbade\nIndex of executive summaries\nSince 1976, the U.S. Treasury has made coupon-bearing securities available through auction sales. This format is generally considered a more efficient and less costly alternative to the use of fixed-price offerings: the Treasury's method of issuing notes and bonds prior to 1970.\nThe Treasury was no stranger to securities auctions before 1970 - it had a solid track record of making bills available in this format. However, two earlier attempts to auction long-term bonds - in 1935 and 1963 - had failed. The dilemma facing the Treasury in 1970 was how to introduce an effective program of regular auction sales of notes and bonds.\nThis article observes that the 1970-75 period was a milestone in the evolution of the Treasury market. During the period, the Treasury made the important transition from fixed-price offerings of notes and bonds to market-driven auctions of these securities.\nAuthor Garbade offers three key reasons for why the Treasury was able to move the primary market for coupon-bearing securities to a more efficient configuration in the early 1970s:\nBy closely imitating its well-established bill auction process, the Treasury gave dealers a familiar starting point for developing the risk management and sales programs needed to support auction bidding for notes and bonds.\nThe Treasury announced auctions for securities of gradually increasing maturity, instead of immediately auctioning long-term bonds, like it did in 1935 and 1963. As a result, dealers had sufficient time to build up their risk management and sales programs.\nThe Treasury was willing to alter the auction process when shortcomings appeared - rather than jettison the entire effort, as it did in its two failed attempts.\nGarbade also points to the broader implications of the Treasury's efforts. He explains that the mere prospect of greater efficiency may not effect change that requires many actors to alter familiar behavior patterns; change can also depend on following a path that facilitates learning and implementation of new patterns. According to the author, the Treasury accomplished its objectives in the early 1970s because it enabled dealers to learn gradually about how to participate in note and bond auctions, and because it too was willing to learn from experience.

But the move risks further cheapening the buck  -  and raising the cost of\nliving on ordinary Americans. (REUTERS)\nWall Street  -  and the rest of the world's financial markets  -  rejoiced yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke joined forces with other bank chiefs to buy Europe more time to deal with its deepening debt crisis. The Fed chief  -  along with five of the world's biggest central banks  -  launched a coordinated plan that will make it cheaper for troubled European banks to borrow US dollars as they try to stave off a looming credit crunch.\nThe plan to inject much-needed liquidity into the financial system cheered Wall Street and markets around the world even though it does little to address Europe's longer-term debt woes. JOHN CRUDELE: HOLY SWAP, THERE MUST BE TROUBLE BREWING\nThe Dow Jones industrial average surged 4.2 percent, or 490.05 points  -  its biggest rally in more than 2 1/2 years. The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 51.77 points, or 4.3 percent, to 1,246.96.\nWhile traders clinked their glasses, Bernanke's efforts to shore up global markets could come at a cost to consumers, as the excess cheap cash stands to lower the value of the greenback while raising prices here at home. A weaker dollar also raises the prices of imported goods, like computer chips, warned one hedge-fund manager. Indeed, the dollar fell sharply on yesterday's move as investors sought out currencies with higher returns. The Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index was down more than 1 percent  -  its sharpest decline of the month. Meanwhile, the price of oil and other commodities took off as the dollar plunged. Oil prices hit above $100 a barrel for only the second time in the last six months. Experts said that the risk of inflation will depend on the size of the program after it launches Dec. 5. \"You're putting your foot on the gas pedal of monetary expansion, which causes the price of gasoline to go up,\" said David Darst, chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Yesterday's move by Bernanke \"is a big step in that direction,\" he added. Under the program, the central banks of the US, Europe, Japan, Canada, the UK and Switzerland have agreed to cut the costs of loans under so-called swap lines by 50 basis points. They would lend the money to the European Central Bank, which, in turn, would lend it to the banks. The new program doesn't directly address the root of Europe's problems  -  or the fear of default by debt-burdened euro countries like Greece and Italy  -  so much as ease the resulting strain on banks and, ideally, free them up to loan. Whether it works remains to be seen. Economists say they're still keeping a watchful eye on Europe's measures to cut spending and repay their debt. Also, the swap line program was initially launched in 2008, and European banks have been reluctant to borrow under it, due to the stigma attached. The hope is that the new cheaper rates could change this, market watchers say. The central banks yesterday also said they plan to keep the borrowing window open through Feb 1, 2013. Initially, it was expected to close in August 2012. Share  Share this article:\nGroupon aims for marketing shift after controversial IPO Share Selection\nTrending Nowin Business 1,381"

They were Singh's first remarks since the rupee began tumbling in recent weeks. As he attempted to soothe worries over the economic crisis enveloping Asia's third-largest economy, the rupee staged a mild comeback on Friday, having lost fifteen percent of its value since May. Singh said he believed that the country's currency had slipped below its true value. But he said the depreciation also had an upside. \"To some extent, depreciation can be good for the economy as this will help to increase our export competitiveness and discourage imports,\" he said. Singh said the rupee's slide was due to the expected winding down of the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary stimulus which has pumped cheap money into the wider economy, including emerging markets such as India. Foreign investors have pulled their money out of India in recent weeks in anticipation of the Fed's tapering, which would signal a renewal of the U.S. economy and thus make it a better bet for investors. Singh said Indians need to reduce their $50 billion a year gold-buying habit, which drains foreign reserves and ties up assets in a non-productive holdings. He repeated a mantra of his government, saying, \"We need to reduce our appetite for gold.\" Singh lashed out at the opposition BJP party, which he accused of hurting investor sentiment by repeatedly disrupting the work of Parliament. The 80-year-old prime minster also mildly admonished rich countries, hinting that the U.S. Fed's move should think of its impact on the rest of the world. \"In a more equitable world order, it is only appropriate that the developed countries - in pursuing their fiscal and monetary policies - should take into account the repercussions on the economy of emerging countries,\" he said. Singh  -  who as finance minister was the architect of an overhaul of the Indian economy in the 1990s that helped the country become an international powerhouse  -  emphasized that there was no going back. He said the government was not going to impose controls or reverse its reforms. But some of those reforms are costly. A food security program proposed on Monday would provide huge food subsidies in the form of wheat, rice and coarse grains - some 800 million people would be eligible for the program. Its $20 billion price tag sent markets sharply down over worries of India's rising fiscal deficit. Moody's said that the measure will worsen India's economic imbalance and is a negative development for the country's sovereign rating.Copyright 2013 NPR. To see more, visit .

By Mark Trumbull, Staff writer /\nJob seekers wait in line for a job fair in midtown in New York on September 1.\nFrances M. Roberts / Newscom\nAmerica's poverty rate surged upward last year, underscoring the toll of recession on ordinary households across the nation.Some 13.2 percent of Americans were living below the poverty line in 2008, the Census Bureau said Thursday. That's a significant jump from the 12.5 percent poverty rate a year earlier. The rise means that nearly 40 million Americans are living in poverty, defined by incomes of less than $10,991 for an individual or $22,025 for a family of four.The Census conducts its annual survey on incomes and poverty in the spring of each year, so the 2008 survey captures only the recession's early phase - leaving out the deeper impact as unemployment skyrocketed late last year. This suggests the poverty rate will be even higher in next year's report, but the agency also notes some progress when the data are viewed in a longer-term context.\n\"The poverty rate in 2008 (13.2 percent) was ... 9.2 percentage points lower than in 1959, the first year for which poverty estimates are available,\" the authors write.The report comes as the weak economy, coupled with debate over healthcare policy, has focused attention on the question of government's role in the economy. Many policy analysts say, for example, that the introduction of the Medicare program for seniors is a key reason for the long-term decline in poverty rates for seniors.For all age groups, although poverty rates are lower than in 1959, little progress is visible in the data since the mid-1970s. Poverty goes up in recessions and declines during better times.In his televised speech to Congress Wednesday, President Obama sought to strike a balance on policy. He pitched his healthcare reform plans on the notion that America's character includes individual choice and limits on the size of government (and federal deficits). But he added that \"our predecessors understood that ... the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little.\"Some policy analysts say the new Census data bolster the case that government programs can help the nation meet social-welfare goals amid economic swings. For example, poverty among children rose significantly last year, yet the percentage of children with health insurance actually rose because of growing participation in government-backed healthcare.\"This is entirely due to the overwhelming success of the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid,\" said Bruce Lesley, president of the children's advocacy group First Focus, in a statement analyzing the Census numbers.\nBeyond the poverty numbers, some other highlights of the Census report include:\u2022 Per capita income, adjusted for inflation, fell 3.1 percent in the year. Still, the typical household had inflation-adjusted household income of $50,303, up from about $40,000 in 1967.\u2022 The distribution of income became more unequal, although all income groups have been hit by the recession. The top 20 percent of households earn 50 percent of US personal income, versus 3.4 percent for the bottom 20 percent.\u2022 The percentage of Americans without health insurance stayed relatively flat at 15.4 percent. But the share with employer-sponsored coverage fell, while the share covered by government programs rose.\n - -Healthcare's spending spiral\nObama's pursuit of a healthcare overhaul has put a sharper focus on a central and perplexing issue: how to control fast-rising costs.

        "webpage": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York (often referred to simply as \"the Fed\") has housed the world's largest stock of gold for many years, although little of it belongs to the United States, whose own reserves are largely in Fort Knox and other less well-known depositories. The Fed's stock of \"earmarked gold\", held on behalf of other countries and official financial institutions, originated with the reserves that were shipped over by several European central banks for safe-keeping on the eve of World War II. The bulk of it, however, was purchased by European central banks from the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, as they rebuilt their gold reserves, trading in dollars for gold at the Fed and keeping the bullion in New York to avoid the cost of shipping it home. Another factor at this time influencing the location of European official gold reserves was the perceived military threat from the Soviet Union. At its peak, the Fed held over 12,700 tonnes (around 409 million oz), more than one-third of global official stocks, on behalf of 73 nations or international organisations, such as the IMF.\nThe Fed's famous 'gold window' closed in 1971 when the United States no longer sold gold for dollars at a fixed price, so the stockpile ceased to grow. The bank's reputation as an impartial safe haven was also shaken in 1979 when the US government froze 50 tonnes (1.6 million oz) of Iran's gold at the Fed during the Tehran embassy hostage crisis.\nDuring the 1990s, almost 2,600 tonnes (83 million oz) of gold was moved out of the Fed as many other central banks mobilized their reserves for leasing, swaps or sale. In 2000 and 2001 there was a further outflow of 355 tonnes (11.4 million oz) and 259 tonnes (8.3 million oz) respectively, reducing stocks of \"earmarked gold\" at the Fed to 6,703 tonnes (215.5 million oz) at the end of December 2001. Much of the decline in stocks over the past dozen years has represented gold being moved to London for leasing; indeed, gold flows out of the Fed have in the past often followed hard on rises in the gold leasing rate, as central banks shifted more gold to benefit from higher rates. (Conversely, when leasing rates have been very low - the situation during much of the second half of 2001 - it has not paid foreign central banks to move stocks out of New York.) The improvement in security following the collapse of the Soviet Union has also encouraged some European countries to repatriate their gold holdings. The ongoing decline in Fed stocks means it may eventually lose the cachet of having the world's largest stock in its vaults, because US reserves in Fort Knox alone are around 4,600 tonnes.\nThe Fed, unlike the Bank of England, is not normally engaged in daily gold market operations and does not have the same 'in house' expertise on gold.\n33 Liberty Street\nTel. +1 212 720 5000 Web \nSee also: United States (New York) Market Introduction; Commodities Exchange Inc.

Now, some analysts say pessimism about the sector may be overblown and that the lender's numbers may be a sign of things to come for its peers.\n\nFrederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe company reported third-quarter net profit of 34.76 billion yuan ($5.57 billion), higher than analysts' estimates of 32.7 billion yuan ($5.24 billion). Profits were up 16.7 percent in the July to September period, from 29.8 billion yuan a year earlier, its biggest quarterly profit gain in a year.\n\nInterest margins also widened, with little indication demand for credit has slowed. Indeed, interest margins, which measure loan profitability, actually widened to 2.12 percent at the end of September from 2.1 percent at the end of June.\n\nSome observers had been concerned about the sector, especially a decline in interest margins and a spike in non-performing loans, as they expected a general slowdown in the economy would have dampened appetite for loans and reduced companies' ability to finance borrowings. (Read more: China's Steel Traders Expose Banks' Bad Debts)\n\nAccording to Grace Wu, Hong Kong and China banks analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, Bank of China's margins on Thursday proved that some views had been too bearish.\n\n\"We believe the third-quarter numbers at other big banks are likely to show even better-than-expected (net margin) trends, given that Bank of China's domestic interest margins (are) already the weakest of the Big 4 banks. We believe consensus estimates ...are overly bearish.\"\n\nAttention has now shifted to Agricultural Bank of China (AgBank) and China Construction Bank (CCB), which will report their third-quarter numbers on Friday, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), on October 30.\n\nHow Other Banks May Do\n\nAgBank could post profit growth of 15 percent, and CCB, of about 10 percent for the quarter from a year earlier, according to Barclays' analyst May Yan. ICBC could post earnings growth of 11 percent and is the British bank's top pick among its peers, she added. Sanford C. Bernstein's senior analyst Mike Werner has estimated earnings growth of 8.9 percent, 10.4 percent and 12.2 percent for Agbank, CCB and ICBC, respectively.\n\nWhile still nothing to be scoffed at, the estimates are still lower than the average of 12.45 percent earnings growth that the Big Four posted for the second quarter and marks a sharp slowdown from the 30-35 percent earnings growth enjoyed by the banks in 2010 and the first half of 2011.\n\nHowever, these low expectations may mean that there could be potential for Agbank and CCB to surprise on the upside, Werner said.\n\n\"It's not going to be as bad as some people think. Interest margins are going to hold up ... and businesses are still healthy,\" Werner said. \"It's still healthy numbers coming out from these banks.\"\n\nWerner is however worried about AgBank, which may not have set aside enough capital to compensate for the risk it is taking on its loan books.\n\n\"We are concerned that its low core capital adequacy ratio may force it into a dilutive equity rights offering in the coming 12 months,\" Werner said. \"That is very negative for share prices. And that's the concern we have for AgBank now. We could see Ag bank in theory slow down their growth tremendously.\"\n\nAdding to a brighter picture for Chinese banks is the non-performing loan ratio at Bank of China, which actually declined. At the end of September, the bank's non-performing loan ratio stood at 0.93 percent, down from 0.94 percent at the end of June. (Read more: China Banks' Bad Loans Steady, Capital Adequacy Up)\n\nSimon Ho, head of regional financials at Citi, said there could be a chance that non-performing loans would increase in the third quarter for banks, but this is not in \"blowup territory yet.\" As a comparison, the non-performing loans ratio for U.S. banks is close to 5 percent, according to data from the World Bank.\n\n\"We view both institutions as defensive plays, based on what we see as their superior financial profiles and an attractive dividend,\" he said. He expects the two banks to post 12 percent and 11.2 percent increase in third-quarter profits."

        "webpage": "See More StoriesFeb 22 2012Spotlight - Why You Need Alternatives in Your Portfolio\nManaging risk-adjusted returns is the key to long-term investment success\nBy Kerry O'Boyle, Aston Asset Management\nAlternative funds are all the rage these days, and for good reason - there is a sound investment rationale behind their inclusion in a portfolio. The difficulty for most investors is in understanding just what an alternative investment is and how best to fit Alternatives in with a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds. Opinions vary, as the relative newness of the asset class in mutual fund form and the myriad of strategies available makes it difficult to come up with a standard approach. Regardless, the basic justification for using Alternatives remains. They serve as a unique diversifier to traditional asset classes that can help improve the overall risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio. Alternatives Defined\nJust what is an Alternative investment? At Aston, we define Alternatives as strategies focused on managing volatility and providing lower correlations to traditional asset classes using hedging techniques. The key to our interpretation is that risk management is an overarching theme in running the portfolio. Using Alternatives means something more than being just a different asset class than stocks and bonds, and relying on the traditional concept of diversification of volatility. Alternatives do that, of course, but they should also contribute to better risk-adjusted returns by managing and, ideally, lowering volatility inherently.\nTo accomplish this, we believe that Alternative strategies must actively manage risk and/or use some sort of hedging technique. Hedging, whether frequent, infrequent, or in between, comes in many forms regardless of the underlying securities used. Techniques employed include long-short, derivatives, options, futures, and in certain circumstances even leverage. Alternatives that actively manage risk without the direct use of hedging are typically described as Tactical Asset Allocation strategies. Here the focus is more on managing overall volatility through sector and asset rotation than on security selection or hedging. These two approaches - hedging and active risk management - define Alternatives as something more than merely a diversifier of long-only volatility.\nGiven that definition, some examples of what we do not consider alternative investments - Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), long-only foreign securities, convertible bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) - may prove instructive. Despite their focus on real estate, a REIT is mainly a tax structure that closely resembles, and has relatively high correlations, with long-only equities. International or global portfolios that merely hedge back foreign currencies to the US dollar don't pass muster as utilizing an active hedging strategy. Although often used in arbitrage strategies that would be considered alternative, convertibles alone are merely a hybrid of long-only stock and bond characteristics. Finally, doubts still remain as to the actual inflation hedging benefits of TIPS, which in all other facets act like typical bonds.\nInvestors would also do well to note that Alternatives don't necessarily mean hedge funds. The term \"hedge fund\" can be a bit of a misnomer, as a number of hedge funds exist today that do not hedge. Such hedge funds may be aggressive and opportunistic, but without risk management as an integral part of their mandate. Although many hedge funds do employ alternative tools, understand that not all hedge funds are true Alternatives.\nVolatility Effect\nThe case for Alternatives derives from their ability to dampen downside volatility while maintaining return potential over the long haul. The advantage of lower volatility rests with the common, though often overlooked, problem of asymmetry of returns - the return needed to recoup losses after a decline. For instance, an investor that suffers a portfolio loss of 25% requires a gain of 33% to get back to even, not a gain of 25%. A 33% loss needs a 50% gain, and after a loss of 50% a portfolio must double (100% gain) just to get back to where it started. By minimizing such drawdowns - how much a portfolio falls from peak to trough during a market decline - investors stand a better chance of improving the long-term returns of their portfolios.\nThe reason for this lies in the power of compounded returns. Since most investors don't walk away from the table at the end of each year, or after big windfalls or losses, the logic of compound annualized returns supports the case for minimizing downside volatility.

Instead, there appears to have been a systemic breakdown that is far more troubling and highlights the agency's shortcomings in its approach to regulation.\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Inspector General David Kotz told the Senate Banking Committee last week the agency \"never conducted a competent and thorough examination\" of Madoff's business.After an eight month probe, the report released by the inspector general was most striking in two regards: how mundane the scheme really was and how brilliantly Madoff carried it off.\nWhat we know now is that while Madoff's scheme would have been easily detected if regulators had only taken the most basic step of verifying some of his trading through a third party, it was Madoff himself who best understood the weaknesses in the system and successfully exploited them.\nAccording to the report, using his perceived influence, Madoff intimidated regulators into failing to press for critical information, played different offices against one another, then used the SEC's lack of enforcement as a marketing tool to draw more investors into his scheme.\nAll of these findings point to the need for an overhaul of the SEC's approach to regulation.\nHere are some of the reforms that may work:\nBecome more like a prosecutor and less like a regulator. That doesn't mean that the powers of the SEC need to change, only its approach to regulation. One of the obvious breakdowns in the system was the lack of follow-through on evidence that suggested fraud. Credible tips were never pursued and inconsistencies in information supplied by Madoff were never explained. Rather than approaching an investigation with a preconceived notion of what documentation is relevant, investigators can use a more prosecutorial approach by following the evidence and allowing the information gathered to dictate the direction of the investigation.\nDon't compartmentalize investigations by office. We now know that Madoff deftly played off one office against the other, deflecting inquiries for information by suggesting that the same information had already been provided to another office. In the same way that the Department of Justice ultimately orchestrated all prosecution of organized crime by the U.S. Attorney's Offices across the country in Washington D.C., stronger coordination of these inquiries by the SEC's Washington office will prevent information from falling between the cracks as a result of multiple investigations.\nRequire greater involvement of upper management in responding to an investigation. The report shows how Madoff carefully controlled the response to SEC inquiries by limiting the majority of the interaction with regulators to himself. This enabled him to better control the investigations and attempt to bully junior investigators who were apparently both intimidated and mesmerized by his self-described stature in the industry and connections to high level SEC administrators.\nBy forcing those responding to SEC inquiries to allow regulators to speak with a number of people in management, investigators can reduce the opportunity for one person to weave a consistent lie as Madoff did, and increase the chances that someone who is required to respond will be unwilling to mislead regulators.\nCertainly other reforms will be needed, and the SEC has already taken steps to try to address many of these concerns. But clearly even more fundamental change is necessary.\nUnless the SEC is willing to look closely at its own conduct with a critical eye, we run the risk of allowing another Bernie Madoff to defraud future investors and elude the SEC simply by understanding the regulators better than they understand themselves."

        "webpage": "Gov. Brown's pension-reform plan: Painful but necessary\nMatthew DeBord\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown announces his public employee pension reform plan October 27, 2011 at the State Capitol in Sacramento, California. Max Whittaker/Getty Images\nJerry Brown rolled out his pension reform plan yesterday. The Patt Morrison Show did an entire segment on it. The upshot? it's a humdinger. The New York Times sums it up:\nMr. Brown called for raising the retirement age of new employees who do not work in public safety to 67 from 55. He said employees should pay up to 50 percent of their annual pension costs. To reduce the financial exposure of the state, he said future pensions should be a hybrid of the traditional pension model and a 401(k).\nTo deal with what have been widely seen as abuses of the retirement system, Mr. Brown said the pensions of all new employees should be based solely on their regular salaries, not taking into account any overtime or bonuses. For existing employees, he said the retirement benefits should be based on an average of the last three years' salary.\nHe also said that state employees should be barred from double-dipping: retiring, taking pensions and then taking on another state job.\nForget about the abuse, double-dipping  -  that stuff is all a sensationistic distraction from the meat of the matter, which is the raising of the retirement age and the \"hybrid\" model for future pensions. (To be honest, I'm not completely sure what the impact of the 50-percent employee payment would be  -  that's less a state issue than a municipal one, which the cities might ultimately be unable to afford.)\nThe retirement age hike is a big deal: a 12-year additional wait to access benefits. For all practical purposes, it ends early retirement on a pension as we know it. Plus, it aligns the California retirement age with what will be the eventual national retirement threshold, also 67 (for retirees born after 1959  -  if you were born after 1938, the age will gradually creep up from 65 until it hits 67). Who knows whether Brown set the age so much higher because he figures he may ultimately have to compromise on something between 55 and 67. The crux is that it's irresponsible for Calfornia to hold the line on 55 in the face of the pension costs that over time will drive the state into insolvency. Californians are living longer; they're also going to have to work longer.\nA bolder change is the move from a traditional pension to a hybrid that would shift the investment risk from the state to individual. Calpers, the big state pension fund, was fully funded in 2007, but now it's only 70 percent funded. Additionally, Calpers needs a 7.75 annual return on its investments to meet its obligations. It's only ever beaten that on a 20-year basis, at 8.38 percent. Since 2006 Calpers has returned 3.41 percent.\nBig pension funds have been successfully moving into riskier investments, such as private equity and hedge funds. But this risk obviously makes fund managers and politicans, not to mention current and future retirees, nervous  -  pension funds are supposed to be conservatively invested, not swinging for the fences in hopes of making up for the bad years.\nBut Calpers isn't in a position to do that. It needs that 7.75 percent like a drum needs drumsticks. But it's difficult to see where it's going to come from, outside risky plays. A lot of investment pros think they markets will be lucky to return 6.5 percent over the next decade or so.\nThe thinking in Sacramento is that the risky side of the equation can be offloaded to individuals. The state can then focus on a return that's designed to beat the rate of inflation  -  say, 4-5 percent  -  and leave individuals to chase 8-10 percent. This could be a viable solution, as long as the state encourages its hires to educate themselves on how retirement planning works, outside defined-benefit traditional pensions. Many participants in 401(k) plans do a lousy jobs of managing them.\nPensions is California must be reformed (Michael Lewis recently wrote an entire Vanity Fair article on the subject). Gov. Brown has taken the first, very big step. Let's hope that he doesn't wind up falling on his face.\nFollow Matthew DeBord and the DeBord Report on Twitter.\nLet the battle begin: Stagflation or 'Stuckflation'?"

Weak economic performance in the euro area, the slowdown in some emerging economies and uncertainty over U.S. monetary and fiscal policy are also weighing on Latin America's weaker outlook.\n\"Latin America can still achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, but the window is narrowing,\" said OECD Secretary General Angel Gurr\u00eda. \"To meet the new challenges and opportunities posed by an increasingly interconnected global economy, countries across the region need to boost competitiveness, through economic diversification, improved logistics performance and a move up the value chain towards higher value-added activities,\" Mr Gurr\u00eda said (read the full speech in Spanish).\nAlicia B\u00e1rcena, ECLAC Executive Secretary said: \"It is necessary to adopt reforms to enhance productivity and reinforce the capacity of governments to respond to the demands of an 'emerging middle class,' while redoubling their efforts to reduce the levels of poverty and inequality.\"\nThe Latin American Economic Outlook says technological innovation and economic diversification will be key to boosting productivity and potential growth, which remain low when compared to other regions. Latin America's contribution to global GDP growth has remained virtually unchanged (i.e., between 7% and 9%) since the early-1990s, while that of emerging Asia has more than doubled in the same period.\nMany Latin America economies remain heavily focused on natural resources - commodities make up 60% of the region's goods exports, up from 40% at the beginning to the last decade.\nThe report presented today encourages countries to use their natural wealth as a foundation for transitioning to production processes that use technology and knowledge. It also advocates that Latin American economies diversify exports, particularly toward the services sector, which offers greater opportunities over the medium and long-term future. Deepening the regional market would offer additional room for the services sector to grow and diversification to flourish.\n\"Further investment in transport infrastructure, and better logistics performance in general, is needed.\" said Enrique Garc\u00eda, President and Chief Executive Officer of CAF. \"Latin America's production structure is more sensitive to logistics than that of the OECD countries. The share of time-sensitive exports in Latin America is three times that of the OECD countries, which underlines the importance of improving logistics to strengthen overall economic performance\", Mr Garc\u00eda, added.\nTransport infrastructure remains deficient, with an urgent need for investment in roads, railways, ports and airports. Investing 5.2% of regional GDP per year in infrastructure projects would help Latin America close the infrastructure gap with other emerging regions and could increase GDP growth by an estimated 2 percentage points per year. Much can also be done in the short term to improve the transport of goods and services using existing infrastructure, through integrated logistics policies, modern storage facilities, efficient customs and certification procedures, and promoting competition in transport.

Over 82,600 workers are expected to lose benefits by the end of the year.Imagine getting laid off from your job and struggling to support your family. How will you make rent or keep up with your mortgage payment? How will you buy groceries and pay the utility bills? Thankfully, unemployment benefits are a safety net while you look for work in a tough economy, to ease the financial burden and stress when you fall on hard times.\nIn the aftermath of the Great Recession, this frightening scenario has hit close to home for many Maryland families. It was just a few years ago that our economy was brought to its knees and millions of workers found themselves out of a job and out of luck. The economic crisis was not only deep, it lasted far longer than anybody expected, and many people who yearned to work could not find jobs for years. Even now, the recovery is tentative and sluggish. Yet, while it may be hard to imagine, things could have been much worse. Since 2008, more than 24 million Americans have been able to rely on long-term unemployment insurance to stay on their feet until they found their next job and received their next paycheck.Unfortunately, funding for this vital lifeline for jobless workers expired on Dec. 28th, and benefits that kept millions out of poverty vanished in the midst of a weak economy. The failure to renew this benefit is now costing a staggering 22,900 Maryland workers $7,472,270 a week, robbing families of a support system that remains essential to economic survival. Over 82,600 workers are expected to lose benefits by the end of the year.\nIn today's economy, nearly three jobless workers apply for each job opening, and more than 37 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for at least six months. Numerous studies have shown employers frequently discriminate against the long-term unemployed, leaving far too many workers in Maryland out in the cold. For the families of these job seekers, unemployment benefits represent the difference between total hopelessness and a place to live and food on the table.While many portray unemployment insurance as a hand-out or giveaway, jobless workers must demonstrate that they are constantly searching for work to receive unemployment benefits. The benefits themselves are very modest, averaging just $300 a week.But ensuring these families can make ends meet has been demonstrated to create jobs and boost the economy, since a decline in buying power can send a weak economy into a deeper tailspin.This fight impacts more than just the jobless  -  it has serious implications for Maryland's economy. By not extending unemployment benefits, we are robbing businesses of customers and costing the country more than 240,000 jobs, including 3,462 jobs in Maryland. Gov. Martin O'Malley recognizes this and has been a leader in urging other governors across the country to speak up about the broad impact of cutting off unemployment benefits. I gladly join him in urging Congress to think about the economic consequences if these benefits are not renewed.\nThe Congressional Budget Office considers unemployment benefits to be one of the most important and effective economic stimulus programs. Unlike multi-millionaires who receive a tax cut, jobless workers are much more likely to go out and spend that money in the local economy. As the year goes on, the consequences will be even worse when benefits for 3.6 million Americans are scheduled to expire.Especially in times of need, Maryland's working families must demand that Congress creates good jobs and restores opportunity that grows the economy from the middle class out. Members of Congress have a chance to help Maryland workers by voting to restore unemployment benefits as they return to work this month. I urge our elected officials to show leadership and vote to extend unemployment benefits for the hardest hit. Our economy cannot afford for them not to.Fred Mason is the president of the Maryland-DC AFL-CIO, representing 55 labor unions in Maryland and Washington, D.C. His email is .

Despite this, low levels of trust in both business and government are particularly concerning at a time when trust levels in neighboring and peer countries have been recovering.\"\n\"Leaders in business and government must embrace the public's desire for transparency as well as listening to and acting on the concerns of their stakeholders,\" he added.Highlights of the survey include:\n-Trust in government remained largely stable over the year after rising the previous year;\n-Banking at 15 per cent and financial services at 18 per cent remain the least trusted industry sectors in Ireland while the technology sector continues to be the most trusted with 64 per cent;-The primary reasons for the general population's lack of trust in business were found to be a combination of perceptions of corruption or fraud and the wrong incentives driving business decisions;\n-The primary reasons for people's lack of trust in government were found to be poor performance and incompetence;\n-Levels of trust in media of 45 per cent and NGOs of 63 per cent both rose by 10 percentage points in 2012 with media benefiting from a diversification of options and strong coverage of scandals;\n-Traditional media (newspapers and broadcast) at 51 per cent is the most trusted source of information in Ireland among the general public, followed by online search engines. Only one in four claim to trust social media.\n-Levels of trust in ethics and morality in Ireland are very low - people do not trust government or business leaders to tell the truth, make ethical decisions, solve social issues or regulate problem sectors;\n-Some 59 per cent of Irish people trust the European Union more than their own national government to manage the eurozone debt crisis. This contrasts with UK and Germany where more people (almost half) trust their national government.According to Business ETC, the survey found that Irish respondents were dissatisfied with the performance of banks in areas such as lending, pricing and the safeguarding of customers' personal information. The survey also found that 66 per cent of people believed that banks themselves were entirely to blame for a number of high profile banking scandals during the year instead of external factors like regulation or the economy."

Richard Rosen, R-Bucksport, said he has been pleased with the broad perspective of ideas coming out of the task force process but hasn't seen too many surprises. He did agree that the group's decisions are getting more difficult.\n\n\u2022 Eliminating the general fund contribution to the state's Head Start program, saving nearly $2.5 million.\n\n\u2022 Eliminating funding for the WrapAround ME program, which helps young people transition from a residential treatment or correctional facility. That would save approximately $4.2 million.\n\nSome Democrats serving on the budget-cutting task force are concerned about cuts that would affect needy population groups.\n\n\"At this point, I am opposed to those ideas,\" said Rep. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake. \"I'd like to see some alternatives where we can continue to provide services but maybe offer them in a cheaper way.\"\n\nDuring the process, some proposals have been noncontroversial and were supported by all task force members. Other ideas have drawn outrage.\n\nAt a meeting in early October, some questioned whether the state's education system should bear such a high burden. Roughly $7 million in funding for Maine's higher education facilities had been targeted for cuts.\n\nNot all proposals have been endorsed.\n\nAt an Oct. 28 meeting, the task force rejected a proposal from the Department of Corrections to close the Down East Correctional Facility in Bucks Harbor, a move that would have saved about $4 million.\n\nRosen said in the past lawmakers who tried to balance the budget often made across-the-board cuts that were distributed evenly.\n\n\"That was an acceptable approach, but this task force's work is different,\" he said. \"We were, by statute, asked to look for efficiencies and eliminate redundancies. That may not end up meaning equal cuts across all departments.\"\n\nIf the Legislature fails to pass a bill, the governor could use curtailment to make the cuts. The Legislature could then undo the governor's curtailment, but only a simple majority would be needed to affirm the governor's action. With Republican majorities in the House and Senate, that seems likely.\n\nIn a letter sent recently to task force members, the Maine Center for Economic Policy urged a more balanced approach to streamlining the budget, including looking at revenues.\n\n\"Specifically, we urge the task force to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and\n\npriority of the many tax expenditures in Maine's tax code,\" the letter reads. \"Maine has more than 100 personal and corporate income tax and property tax reimbursement programs, as well as more than 100 sales and excise tax exceptions.\n\n\"Tax expenditures deserve the same level of scrutiny and review that all government programs receive to determine their cost effectiveness,\" the letter said.\n\nAs examples, the center pointed to three areas: reimbursement for taxes paid on certain business property, the exemption on fuel and electricity used at manufacturing facilities, and the exemption on machinery and equipment. Together, those three tax programs add up to nearly $100 million for fiscal year 2013.\n\nAnother point of contention could be the $25 million target.\n\nRosen said he would like to see the task force go over that mark and perhaps get to $35 million.\n\nMartin said he's not opposed to additional cuts, but said it's not the responsibility of the task force to find those cuts."

Email\nCommentThe contracts were sold quickly and in large numbers, according to the report, on a day when the market was already under stress due to concerns about the European debt crisis. The selling was initially absorbed by \"high frequency traders\" and other buyers, the report said. But the algorithm responded to an rise in trading volume by increasing the number of E-Mini sell orders it was feeding into the market.\"What happened next is best described in terms of two liquidity crises -- one at the broad index level in the E-Mini, the other with respect to individual stocks,\" the report said. Circuit breakers, yes. But how about the market breakers?In other words, the lack of buyers and the rapid selling of E-Mini futures contracts began to affect the underlying stocks and the broader stock indexes. As a result, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged nearly 1,000 points, briefly erasing $1 trillion in market value, before regaining much of the lost ground to close lower. It was the largest one-day drop on record. Waddell & Reed, an asset management and financial planning company based in Overland Park, Kan., has been widely reported as the investor behind the sell order. But the report identified only a \"large fundamental investor.\" Waddell said in May that it was one of possibly 250 other investors trading the E-mini futures contract on the day in question, and that it did not intend to disrupt the market. 0:00\n/4:31SEC returns to regulatingThe report outlined in detail the technical factors that gave rise to the market turmoil. But it did not contain any specific policy recommendations that would prevent another flash crash from happening, which caught some on Wall Street off gaurd. \"It's a good synopsis of what went on,\" said Joe Saluzzi of Themis Trading. \"But there are no recommendations here.\"The report has been submitted to a joint SEC-CFTC advisory committee, which will eventually make recommendations to Congress related to market structure issues and disparate trading rules across various markets.SEC chairman Mary Schapiro and CFTC chairman Gary Gensler said in a joint statement that the report \"reaffirms the importance of a number of the actions we have taken since that day.\"\"We now must consider what other investor-focused measures are needed to ensure that our markets are fair, efficient and resilient, now and for years to come,\" the statement said. In June, the SEC approved new rules that will halt trading uniformly across all U.S. markets for stocks experiencing wild price swings. The so-called circuit breakers require exchanges to stop trading in an individual stock for five minutes across U.S. stock markets if the stock experiences a 10% price swing in the preceding five-minute period.Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., who chairs a House subcommittee on capital markets, praised the report but said more needs to be done to rein in the use of algorithms used by high frequency traders. \"The SEC and CFTC report confirms that faster markets do not always lead to better markets,\" Kanjorski said in a statement. \"While automated, high-frequency trading may provide our markets with some benefits, it can also carry the potential for serious harm and market mischief.\" Print\nBrokers could face fines over 'flash crash' SEC OKs 'flash crash' fix"

Buoyed by decades of material growth, we expect GDP to rise and standards of living to improve indefinitely. If these trends stagnate - as they've begun to during the current recession - pundits on all sides point fingers, assuming that something has gone terribly wrong.\nBut according to John Dillon, former classics professor at Trinity College, Dublin, classical thinkers would have found this assumption misguided. \"This concept of progress,\" Dillon explains to Big Think, \"is so deeply ingrained in our psyches that it is hard for modern man to comprehend a culture in which no such concept is present....[But] among Greek and Roman intellectuals, it was fully recognized that nations and societies had their ups and down, that empires rose and fell....It was universally accepted that change in the physical world was cyclical: some new inventions were made from time to time, predominantly in the area of warfare, populations might increase locally, and cities, such as Alexandria, Rome, or Constantinople, grow to great size...but all this would be balanced by a decline somewhere else.\"\nThis recognition of natural balance was more than a shrug of philosophical acceptance. For thinkers like Plato, it was fundamentally relevant to the question of how societies could best be organized. In The Republic and The Laws, Plato sketches visions of an ideal state, but offers no prescriptions for ever-increasing prosperity. Rather, he portrays societies that have achieved a harmonious - and stable - equilibrium in their population, politics, and economy.\nWhile cautioning that \"I would not for a moment advocate a full dose of Platonism for a modern state,\" Dillon does believe that contemporary society should embrace Plato's ideal of stability as opposed to progress. He warns that we've already begun to witness the fruit of a growth-at-all-costs mentality: resource wars (including, in his view, Iraq) and untold environmental destruction. Accordingly, he advocates stringent worldwide anti-pollution laws and recommends \"pay[ing] very serious attention\" to Plato's \"insistence on limiting production...to necessities rather than luxuries.\" Against the ideal of ever-increasing wealth, he suggests that citizens and their governments should espouse the Platonic vision \"of a modest sufficiency of material goods.\"\nFenton Communications CEO Lisa Witter would agree that capitalism's promise of progress has become an article of faith - and a dangerous one. In a 2008 interview with Big Think she argued that global capitalism has \"run amok,\" and that the problem of how to \"continue to have growth without using up all of our natural resources\" is becoming unmanageable:\n\nWas Darcy a One Percenter?

While banks understand the benefits of using more modern systems, they often shy away from the transition because of its complex process. Transforming core banking systems often involves a multi-year, multi-phase makeover that can be costly and time intensive. Additionally, where banks are expected to provide their services 24/7, replacing these core systems can significantly impact their ability to service their customers. Also, in recent years, financial institutions have experienced a significant increase in regulatory requirements, making it more cumbersome than ever to properly integrate these new systems onto their platforms.\nHowever, banks do not have the option to put off this core system transformation for much longer. The economics of the industry are no longer allowing these financial institutions to continue to delay this inevitable renovation, as the benefits far outweigh the negatives. Modern banking systems allow banks to be more flexible and enable them to act more efficiently in response to the changing market opportunities. For example, on a newer, more modern system, banks have the capabilities to launch products more quickly by reusing already existing components rather than having to replace individual parts on legacy systems. Unlike legacy systems, modern systems also allow banks to have a single and complete view of the customer in real- time. Finally, research has shown that banks that stay on these legacy systems ultimately spend more money trying to upgrade their systems piece by piece than they would if embraced a newer, more modern platform. [The challenges of core systems modernization projects: Pride and Prejudice and Core Systems]\nNot surprisingly, banking institutions worldwide are investing in technologies that help them modernize their existing systems. For example, Indian banks went through this complicated process between 2004 and 2008. Now, five years later, all of these banks are on real-time views, are heavily involved in e-banking, have reduced process turnaround and are better at understanding customer insight. Banks in China, Eastern Europe and the EU market also are undergoing this major transformation, which shows that this is truly a global transformation for the banking industry.\nRecent research also has indicated that the global banking industry could regain a significant proportion of the profitability lost during the financial crisis by adopting these new modern-day systems. According to new research by Temenos and Deloitte, the implementation of modern banking platforms could close the gap by as much as 60%, or US $180 billion. Over the past three years alone, banks that have adopted these new modern platforms have experienced on average 25% higher return on assets and a 37% higher return on capital compared to banks that are still running on their legacy applications.\nOnce financial institutions realize that this change needs to occur, they can begin the replacement process. This typically begins with building a business case. A bank must identify the specific problems that need to be solved to ensure it is receiving a valuable return on investment. For example, banks should ensure that they replace their existing systems with a centralized platform that can deliver speed to market and is more flexible and accountable. It is no secret that replacing your bank's core legacy system is a major endeavor for any bank to undertake. However, it does not have to be as challenging and costly as many assume. By investing the right resources into modernizing these systems, banking institutions can not only save money but also advance their customer offerings.

States Move on Minimum Wage\nWhile Republicans in Congress balk, 19 states have enacted a minimum wage higher than the federal level.\nBy Lorraine Woellert, Bloomberg February 14, 2013\nPresident Barack Obama's proposal to increase the U.S. minimum wage by 24 percent faces long odds in Congress, where Republicans took aim at it minutes after the State of the Union address. That might not matter: beyond Capitol Hill, some states took action long ago.\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already require employers to pay more than the $7.25 an hour required by federal law, according to the U.S. Labor Department. At least eight more, including New York and New Jersey, are considering legislation to join them. On Jan. 1, Washington state, home to the highest minimum wage in the nation, raised its floor to $9.19, more than the $9 an hour proposed by Obama.\nThe patchwork of laws has offered new insight into the effect of higher wages on jobs. Some economists are challenging the traditional precept that as the price of something goes up, demand goes down, at least when it comes to labor.\n\"We've had this natural experiment where states that have raised their minimum wage border states that haven't,\" said Jack Temple, a policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a non-profit worker advocacy group. \"Businesses have adjusted without losing employment.\"\nTemple and others point to two studies that challenge the conventional wisdom that higher wages lead to fewer jobs. The first, a 1994 study by Alan Krueger, now Obama's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, and David Card, director of the Labor Studies Program at the National Bureau of Economic Research, compared fast food eateries in New Jersey and Pennsylvania after New Jersey raised its hourly minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05 in 1992.\n\"The increase in the minimum wage increased employment,\" the two found. For low-wage workers, job prospects actually improved in New Jersey, they concluded.\nThat finding was buttressed in 2010, when a group of economists used a similar approach to compare restaurant workers in neighboring states with different wage limits. The study, authored by a group that included Michael Reich, director for the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, concluded that minimum wage increases did not reduce employment.\nThe findings are at odds with other work, most notably from David Neumark, director of the University of California's Center for Economics and Public Policy in Irvine, who has studied the question with Federal Reserve economist William Wascher.\nTheir 2007 review of academic studies found that \"almost all point to negative employment effects.\"\n\"It's the law of demand,\" said William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business, a lobbying group for small employers. \"The higher the price of anything, the less will be taken. That applies to labor.\"\nIn his speech Feb. 12 to a joint session of Congress, Obama proposed raising the hourly federal minimum wage to $9 from $7.25 by the end of 2015. That would return the wage to its highest inflation-adjusted value since 1981, under Republican President Ronald Reagan, according to the White House.\nEchoing Dunkelberg, House Speaker John Boehner dismissed the idea yesterday.\n\"When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it,\" the Ohio Republican told reporters. \"Why do we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?\"\nIn the Senate, John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the chamber's Republican leadership, called Obama's speech a \"go-through-the-motions laundry list.\""

That is likely to bring more layoffs as Portugal scrambles to restore its financial health after it needed a 78 billion euro ($101 billion) bailout in 2011.\"Today, we are still not out of the financial emergency which placed us in this painful crisis,\" Passos Coelho said.Portugal's worsening problems threaten to reignite the eurozone's financial crisis not long after Cyprus became the fifth member of the 17-nation bloc to require rescue.The Portuguese economy contracted 3.2 percent last year and is forecast to shrink 2.3 percent in 2013 for a third straight year of recession. The unemployment rate, currently at a record 17.5 percent, is forecast to climb to 18.5 percent in 2014.European leaders have for three years struggled to contain the financial crisis, and Portugal's ongoing problems illustrate the dilemma of finding a balance between austerity measures and growth policies. Many Europeans want to abandon the austerity path and start spending again to create jobs and wealth.The Constitutional Court on Friday prohibited pay cuts for government workers and pensioners included in this year's state budget, leaving the government just nine months to make up for the sudden shortfall of 1.3 billion euros.\"After this decision by the Constitutional Court, it's not just the government's life that will become more difficult, it is the life of the Portuguese that will become more difficult and make the success of our national economic recovery more problematic,\" Passos Coelho said.He noted that Portugal has made progress on reducing its budget deficit, which stood at 10.1 percent in 2010. Last year, it was 6.4 percent. Even so, the three main international ratings agencies still classify Portuguese government bonds as junk.Passos Coelho said the court's decision was a setback for Portugal's hopes of returning to international financial markets soon. The ruling \"introduces uncertainty into a process that is already very demanding,\" he said.It also means the government will have to present new plans to the foreign bailout lenders  -  the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and the European Commission  -  who are monitoring Portugal's progress and disbursing the funds only when they are satisfied that appropriate debt-reduction measures are being implemented.The prime minister said his center-right coalition government won't resign after just two years in power. It has a solid majority to enact its policies through Parliament, but more broadly it is on shaky ground. It is cornered by the austerity demands of the bailout lenders, public anger at those demands, and political opponents who want new elections.Trade unions and business leaders also want an end to austerity measures, saying they are choking economic growth. Even senior members of the governing parties have expressed doubts about the country's path.Furthermore, the bailout lenders want the government to come up with an additional 4 billion euros of savings over the next two years.Portugal could be forced to ask the lenders to ease its budget deficit targets, though the creditors have already softened this year's goal to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product from 4.5 percent.Alternatively, Lisbon may need more time to pay off its debts and, perhaps, more money to get by until it can, though Passos Coelho said his government does not intend to ask for a second bailout."

But by putting an end to the uncertainty over future tax rates, the deal could encourage businesses to invest, expand and hire more workers, experts said.\nStill, there are new clouds on the horizon: in a few weeks, Congress is expected to embark on deficit reduction, with spending cuts that could dampen economic activity.\"With some stability, business owners can now make business decisions,\" said Alan D. Sobel, managing member of Sobel & Co., in Livingston. \"What really interferes with making decisions is uncertainty  -  people become paralyzed and sit on the sidelines. So my sense is that now that there is some element of certainty  -  at least, as it relates to income taxes  -  business owners are going to be freed up to be able to make decisions about investments in equipment, investments in people, in opening up new markets.\"David Brogan, first vice president of the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, echoed that sentiment, saying the deal \"will create a level of certainty that is necessary for any economic rebound.\" He said keeping tax rate unchanged for singles earning less than $400,000 and couples earning less than $450,000 will mean a significant number of New Jersey small businesses won't see their taxes go up; President Barack Obama's original proposal  -  to raise taxes on incomes of more than $200,000 and $250,000, respectively  -  would have done far more damage in New Jersey, Brogan said.Brogan said businesses also will be helped by the move by Congress, as part of the fiscal cliff deal, to extend bonus deprecation, which had been set to expire at the end of 2012, for another year. This allows companies to write off 50 percent of the capital investment the first year.Bob Mathers, director in the tax department at Hunter Group CPA LLC, in Fair Lawn, said the extension of the bonus depreciation rule for one year is a direct boost to business. \"We now know what's going to happen for the next 12 months. We know if we need to spend money on equipment, that we can do that and get a direct writeoff without having to spread it out over several years,\" he said. \"When Congress comes back, there will still be a lot of talk about tax reform, but least we do have some certainty for the next 12 months.\"Many companies did resolve to move forward with their business plans last year  -  buying equipment or buildings, and hiring new workers  -  regardless of what happened in Washington. Some evidence of business confidence can be seen in Small Business Administration loan demand, which was strong in 2012, when New Jersey had its third-best SBA lending year on record, according to Al Titone, state district director for the SBA.\"People just couldn't wait any more,\" he said. \"You can only sit so long on the sidelines and then basically you jump in when you think you've got an opportunity.\"Anika Khan, senior economist of Wells Fargo, said the looming cliff led businesses to \"defer a lot of their spending activity due to uncertainty.\" But the deal reached by Congress doesn't restore clarity, she said, and the end of the payroll tax holiday affects all workers, and \"is going to cause household to pull back a bit on making some of their spending decisions.\"And in a few weeks, there will be budget cuts that will impact the economy, she added. \"Until businesses get completely clear about what the economic landscape is going to look like, and what their contribution is going to have to be, they are going to continue to be on the fence.\"Pat O'Keefe, director of economic research at CohnReznick, said when Congress takes up federal spending, \"the ripple will be significant.\"Lawmakers, he said, must address long-term cost increases in Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid. \"If that curve is not tilted downward or reduced gradually, it becomes highly disruptive,\" O'Keefe said. \"And the rancorous brinksmanship that has characterized fiscal and tax policy for the better part of a decade always runs the risk of a catastrophic event.\"\nBeth Fitzgerald\nBeth Fitzgerald reports on health care, small business and higher education.

The over-indebtedness in a very low inflation environment poses huge risks to the growth outlook for the euro zone,\" he said on the sidelines of a conference in London. \"There is no need to raise the ratings until the (economic) fundamentals improve.\" Kraemer said the countries that had made most progress in cutting debts included Ireland and Spain, and both had seen their ratings upgraded. S&P raised Ireland by one notch to A-minus earlier this month, citing its brighter economic outlook Last month, the agency raised Spain by one notch to triple-B on similar grounds.\nKraemer said the return to debt markets of Cyprus, which was bailed out just a year ago, and Greece had little impact on their ratings. Cyprus, whose rating S&P raised one notch to B in April, last week raised 750 million euros ($1 billion) in a sale of five-year bonds. A senior Greek finance ministry official told Reuters last week that Greece was preparing to issue a small-sized, medium-term bond in the coming weeks to follow on from its return to debt markets in April after a four-year break. \"Greece and Cyprus are far away from being self-sustaining and financing themselves. What's much more important ... is how the debt profile of the Greek government improves by the very significant lengthening of maturities of the official loans,\" Kraemer said. \"If you learn anything in the euro zone crisis, it's how quickly you can lose market access again. It would be premature to judge Greece on accessing the market.\"\nFitch, another major ratings agency, took a similar view last week, saying that while the bond issue was positive, the level of sovereign risk in Cyprus remained high.\nKraemer also said that if the European Central Bank went ahead with a program of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing (QE), it was unlikely to have a significant impact on sovereign credit ratings.\nHe said the ECB could not conduct QE in the same way as the Bank of England which has bought the bonds of just one country.\n\"We have 18 members in the euro area, we have a much less developed ABS (asset-backed securities) market for example. So I find it hard to see how the balance sheet would be expanded in a similar way,\" he said.

The key priority areas are food, health and education,\" Tsvangirai said.Schools in Zimbabwe are shut, its economy lies shattered after 29 years of Mugabe rule, and its healthcare system is struggling to cope with a cholera epidemic that has claimed more than 3,750 lives.Nearly 7 million people need food aid and up to 3 million have fled the country. Unemployment is at 94 percent and only 20 percent of children are going to school.Public hospitals are closed, even though 1.3 million people have HIV. The cholera epidemic has ravaged the country, hitting more than 80,000 people since August.Motlanthe said South Africa, chair of the Southern African Development Community bloc, had directed regional finance ministers to develop a plan to help Zimbabwe and again called for sanctions to be lifted.\"They have presented to us their preliminary plan to respond to these challenges which we have agreed to deal with. There are no figures to speak of, these are going to be crunched by technical people and finance ministers to be meeting on these issues,\" Motlanthe said.Tsvangirai said his government would first concentrate on short-term priorities. Zimbabwe is buckling under economic meltdown, characterized by the world's highest inflation, which had officially soared to 231 million percent by last July.Most essential civil servants, including teachers, nurses and doctors, have been on strike since last year over poor pay.Tsvangirai promised to pay them in US dollars to counter the impact of hyperinflation and said Zimbabwe would use a multi-currency approach in the future, using the South African rand and the US dollar.\"As we proceed we will see if the Zimbabwe dollar can be re-used again,\" he said.Analysts have questioned how such bitter adversaries as Mugabe and Tsvangirai would be able to work together to curb the humanitarian crisis.Mugabe, 84, has held for himself the powerful ministries of defense, justice and foreign affairs.Tsvangirai has appointed his top aide Tendai Biti to the crucial post of finance minister.To rebuild the country, they will need massive foreign investment, but western countries so far say they want to see real improvements from the government first.Speaking in Harare on Friday, central bank governor Gideon Gono said regional and international financiers had offered Zimbabwe US$500 million in credit, but were wary of conflicting policy statements.The swearing-in of the new government, supposed to usher in a new era of unity, was marred by the detention of Roy Bennett, a white Zimbabwean farmer who Tsvangirai had named his deputy agriculture minister.His arrest last Friday came shortly before the swearing-in of the unity government's Cabinet and cast immediate doubt on its credibility."

Led by Assistant Professor of Economics Felipe Rezende, the program took place in S\u00e3o Paulo from May 19 to June 9. Alexandre Furtado '15, Andrew Hopkins '16, Fajri Jackson '15, Matthew Johnson '15, Katlain Meyer '17, Sima Rana '15, Robert Serenbetz '14, Aaron Sobell '15 and Victoria Thomas '15 studied some of the major economic and social problems of contemporary Brazil while also experiencing the country's culture.\n\"I decided to attend the program because of my interest in economics and because Brazil is one of the countries that I've always wanted to visit,\" explains Thomas. \"Studying in Brazil gave me a taste of the abroad experience.\"\nThe course built substantially on Rezende's current research, which is funded by the Ford Foundation.\nThis project is investigating the structure of the Brazilian financial system and its regulatory framework, highlighting the country's recent changes in order to identify the - old and new - sources of stability and instability. It also aims to provide policy recommendations for reforming Brazil's financial architecture in order to increase systemic stability as well as the ability to provide funding for development and innovation by the public financial system and by private finance.\n\"We had a very productive and enjoyable week,\" says Rezende. \"We had two distinguished speakers talk about the Brazilian economy and we completed seven major company visits. Our host institution did a fantastic job and our students explored some of the major economic and social problems of contemporary Brazil.\"\nStudents had the opportunity to study firsthand the recent performance of the Brazilian economy, its investment needs and the boom in the housing market, the role of Brazil's financial system in economic development, and the implications for financial instability. They considered the necessity of redesigning the regulatory structure to meet Brazil's objectives of achieving financial stability and to provide finance for development.\nSergio Amaral discussed with students the challenges facing Brazil's growth. A career diplomat, he served in Paris, France; Bonn and Geneva, Switzerland; and twice in Washington, D.C., and was Ambassador to London and Paris. He also served as assistant professor of international relations at the University of Brasilia and was alternate governor to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, having been elected to chair the G 24 for international financial issues. As chief debt negotiator for Brazil before the Bank Advisory Committee and the Paris Club, Amaral concluded in 1988 a set of debt restructuring agreements in the overall amount of $80 billion.\nRubens Ricupero, a Brazilian academic, economist, bureaucrat and diplomat also spoke with the students during the program. He served as the fifth Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development from 1995 to 2004.\nAmong the companies the HWS group visited were: Itau Unibanco, Brazil's largest private bank; Grupo Petropolis, a Brazilian brewery company; Vale, a Brazilian multinational diversified metals and mining corporation and one of the largest logistics operators in Brazil (as well as the third-largest mining company in the world); Petrobras, one of the largest energy companies in the world and a world leader in development of advanced technology from deep-water and ultra-deep water oil production; Odebrecht, a conglomerate consisting of diversified businesses in the fields of engineering, construction, chemicals and petrochemicals; Natura, a manufacturer and marketer of beauty, household and personal care products; and BMF&Bovespa, one of the largest exchanges in the world in terms of market value.\nIn addition to their academic pursuits, the group toured the city and enjoyed an authentic Brazilian steak house for lunches. During the afternoon, students had capoeira, which combines elements of dance, acrobatics and music and samba classes. They also appeared on a major television network during a late night program.\nThe photo above features the abroad group gathering for a photo with HWS Provost and Dean of Faculty Titi Ufomata.

Keep up with what's happening in Washington via the AARP Blog\nAfter a $6 billion campaign and a post-election tug-of-war, President Obama still sits at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue, with a Republican-majority House and Democratic-controlled Senate at the other end. Financial markets and public opinion have made it clear they want leaders to work through four potent dishes  -  reducing the debt, energizing the economy, implementing the health care law and actually cooperating.\nAs the president begins his second term and Congress reconvenes this month, a unique blend of motivation and opportunity exists in abundance. For one thing, none of the Washington politicians has to worry about partisan elections this year. For another, countries such as Greece and Spain have shown the sorts of social and economic upheaval that result when a nation doesn't preemptively tackle its fiscal imbalances. With that dynamic, \"it's possible to get some things done now that were not possible before,\" says Allan Meltzer, professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon University and a fellow at the Hoover Institution.\nFew people understand the issues better than G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. For 33 years, Hoagland worked on Capitol Hill, with a unique vantage point as staff director of the Senate Budget Committee and as a top aide to former Senate Republican leader Bill Frist. Hoagland says that he has never seen so many crucial issues come together at once  -  including the temporary budget that runs out in March, the need to raise the nation's debt limit and the \"fiscal cliff\" deadline. The fiscal problems are so big and so fraught, he says, the two parties will finally be forced to work together for a change. \"It's going to force us back into the old bipartisan way in which we used to get work done around here,\" he says. \"I see coming out of this better policies to address the challenges our country faces.\"\nRepublicans and Democrats each have favorite ingredients  -  the GOP is pushing for cuts to spending, including Medicare and Social Security, and Democrats want higher taxes for the wealthy. An AARP Bulletin poll found public support for raising taxes to close the deficit, strengthen Medicare and Social Security, and finance schools and highways, but skepticism that agreement can be struck. The coming months will show whether lawmakers can compromise to come up with what many experts say is needed  -  a federal budget that is $4 trillion smaller over the next 10 years than the $44 trillion it would be under current law.\nNow is the time for action. If the two sides don't come to an agreement, the consequences are significant. \"Debt will continue to balloon. We are borrowing one-third of everything we spend right now,\" says Isabel Sawhill, a budget expert at the Brookings Institution.\nThe Federal Budget and You\nSome of the options on the table could have far-reaching impact on older Americans. Advocates have argued that Social Security, with its own funding source, shouldn't get drawn into the debate over the deficit. And Medicare's projected spending already was trimmed as part of the health care reform bill. But economists and political scientists on both sides of the ideological divide say no major work will be done on the nation's fiscal problems without including both more tax revenue and cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security.\nThe long list of options to be considered for Social Security includes raising the retirement age beyond the current limit of 67 and raising the cap on wages (now $113,700) subject to the payroll tax. While some Republicans advocate a long-term plan of premium support for Medicare, other Medicare adjustments being debated include raising the eligibility age from 65 to 67; raising the premiums paid by wealthier recipients; more closely linking Medicare costs to inflation; and aligning costs with medical outcomes instead of medical services provided.\nNext page: Tinkering with the tax code. \""

        "webpage": "Help | Connect | Sign up|Log in Steve Forbes and John Prevas\nGlory In Stability And Moderation\nThe following is excerpted from Power Ambition Glory: The Stunning Parallels between Great Leaders of the Ancient World and Today...and the Lessons You Can Learn by Steve Forbes and John Prevas (Crown Business, 2009). \"May it be my privilege to establish the state firm and secure ... so that I might be called the author of the best government and when I die, the foundations which I have laid will remain.\" -Augustus If Augustus could be restored to life from the pages of history, his leadership skills would be highly valued and very much in demand. Today, when many large companies-especially those currently foundering in the depressed financial and automotive sectors-are in severe disarray, his ability to instill confidence and provide direction would make him as close to being the perfect CEO as anyone could be. For August the most important aspect of rebuilding a failing company and then transforming it into an industry leader would be laying the right foundations. With the proper foundations in place and a sense of direction, there would be no limit to what the organization could accomplish. Augustus was a man who by temperament proceeded cautiously in nearly everything he did. His two favorite sayings were festina lente (make haste slowly) and sat celeriter fieri quidquid fiat satis bene (that which has been done well has been done quickly enough). In both his public and his private lives Augustus was guided by a very practical point of view toward just about every problem he encountered. The Roman Empire when Augustus took over had been pulled apart by decades of infighting among key officials. After the murder of Caesar in 44 BC, the resulting civil wars lasted for nearly fifteen years. No part of the Mediterranean, from Spain and North Africa to Egypt and Asia Minor, was left untouched. When the fighting was over, only Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, known in history as Augustus, was left standing. Augustus (63 BC - AD 14) straddled two important periods, the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire-a time of political, economic, and religious transformation. Perhaps the most significant figure in Roman history, he captured power in a period of turmoil, succeeded in reviving and reforming a fractured political system, and then led the Romans forward into a new and prosperous age. Rome's \"first among equals\" (primus inter pares), as Augustus modestly referred to himself, was not a conqueror and warrior in the style of Cyrus, Alexander, or Caesar; he was an administrator. While visiting the mausoleum of Alexander the Great in Egypt, he commented that conquest is the easy and glamorous part of empire building; keeping it together and directing it is the hard part. Augustus consolidated what Caesar had conquered and through reform and competent administration established for Rome an empire that would dominate the ancient world for centuries. The same principle by which Augustus managed Rome holds true for any business today. If the foundations are secure and if leaders have a clear vision, a company has an excellent chance to succeed. Otherwise, it is likely to become stuck in a routine and stagnate. Look at banks, Wall Street investment houses, and brokerage firms. From the late 1920s to the early 1960s, they were stodgy outfits with short workdays. Technology and innovation upended this cozy world. Countless Wall Street firms from that era folded or were submerged. By contrast, John Chambers of Cisco Systems and Larry Ellison of Oracle work relentlessly to change and expand their high-tech firms. Hurry Up, But Take Your Time and Do it Carefully Alfred Sloan, who made General Mills a behemoth in the auto industry and a corporation admired around the world for its success and longevity, and Augustus were kindred spirits. In the early 1920s, General Motors was a poorly run, ramshackle collection of auto companies and nearly bankrupt. At the time, Ford Motor Company was the dominant player in the auto world, with over 50 percent of market share in the United States. No one else in the industry could manufacture a car as cheaply as Henry Ford could put out the Model T or market it more effectively. The Du Pont family invested heavily in General Motors and installed Sloan as president with a mandate to turn it around. Sloan had become president of his father's ball bearing company in 1899 at the age of twenty-four and ran the company successfully for seventeen years before selling it to William Durant, the founder of General Motors. Sloan had watched General Motors fail and was convinced that mismanagement was the problem."

        "webpage": "Why Larry Summers Is Wrong About the British Economy\nTed Bromund / Ryan Bourne / September 20, 2012\nHarvard economist Larry Summers claims in The Washington Post that aggressive fiscal austerity in the U.K. is the primary cause of its continued economic stagnation. But the former Obama advisor understates both the necessity for a credible British fiscal plan in 2010 and the structural factors that have been a drag on British growth since 2010. Most importantly, he significantly overstates the extent to which Britain has actually practiced \"austerity.\"\nWhen Britain's Conservative-led coalition government was formed in 2010, the nation was running a deficit of over 11 percent of GDP (larger than Greece). The Bank for International Settlements forecast that, on unchanged policy, the national debt would rise to over 300 percent of GDP by 2025. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the state controlled over 50 percent of the nation's economy. With the eurozone crisis at one of its periodic peaks, markets were unsurprisingly becoming jittery about the sustainability of Britain's finances.\nThe incoming government responded by laying out a plan to eliminate the structural component of the deficit - the part of the deficit that was not the result of the recession that began in 2008 - and start to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio within five years. This robust-sounding strategy was rewarded with an immediate 50 basis point reduction in yields on British government bonds. International institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and OECD, praised the decisiveness of the government action. The strategy was heavily weighted towards spending cuts, rather than tax increases, in line with international evidence.\nSince then, growth has been much slower than expected. In fact, the British economy is more than 4.5 percent smaller in 2012 Q2 than 2008 Q1. But the independent Office for Budget Responsibility ascribes this slower growth to other factors: high commodity prices, the eurozone crisis, and the fact that the financial sector had larger structural problems than anyone realized in 2010. None of the standard Keynesian models predicted this continued stagnation, even after the austerity was factored in.\nBut the adjustment process has not been helped by the government front-loading damaging hikes to the Value Added Tax (Britain's national sales tax) and the capital gains tax, while cutting investment expenditure. On the other hand, the promised cuts to wasteful current spending, which exploded during the Labour years, have yet to materialise. This all means that despite all the talk about huge spending cuts, spending has actually increased in real terms since 2010, while new tax hikes have been piled on top of the tax rises implemented by the previous Labour government.\nIn short, while Britain has talked a lot about spending cuts - or public austerity - it has not actually practiced it. Instead, it has employed private austerity: Citizens have less income because they are paying more taxes. Even a Keynesian like Summers should recognize that this is not likely to produce growth.\nThe result is that Britain's deficit is still above 8 percent of GDP today (almost exactly the same as the U.S.'s), and on optimistic forecasts its debt will have increased by another \u00a3600 billion by 2015, taking government debt to 92.7 percent of GDP. If Britain started borrowing even more money, its cost of borrowing would likely go up, and its credit rating would go down. For now, Britain can borrow as cheaply as Germany despite a deficit the size of Greece and a debt larger than Spain. But this is not sustainable.\nThe credibility Britain gained by setting out its plan in 2010 bought it short-term breathing room. But a significant reversal of policy - of the type Summers advocates - in an open and already highly indebted economy like Britain's, would increase the size of its deficit, and, crucially, cause interest rates to spike, which would put further downward pressure on investment and growth. The government cannot create sustained growth, though it can certainly slow it down. What is needed to restore prosperity in Britain - as in the United States - is a robust supply-side strategy to raise flagging productivity and accelerate the private-sector adjustment, alongside a continued commitment to rein in government largesse.\nThe approach that Summers is recommending, on the other hand, is a return to the strategy that landed Britain in this mess in the first place: Borrow a lot, and let the future look after itself.\nTed R.

        "webpage": "ShareThis 'Buffett Rule' needed to restore tax fairness\nA new report from the White House's National Economic Council makes a clear and convincing case for why the \"Buffett Rule\" should become the centerpiece of fair tax reform. The rule, named for legendary investor Warren Buffett, is simple. It says no household with an income of more than $1 million per year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than middle-class families pay.\nBuffett has noted that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, and has supported the fix that bears his name. Buffett is far from alone in enjoying substantial tax breaks that Americans with lower incomes can't take advantage of. As the report notes, the average tax rate paid by the highest-income Americans has fallen to its lowest in more than 50 years. Tax rates for middle-income families, meanwhile, have remained roughly the same over that same period.\nThe Buffett Rule has been introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) as the Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012. The Senate is scheduled to vote on the legislation on April 16, the day before this year's federal tax deadline. As the name implies, it would be a step toward restoring fairness to the tax system - taxes would not go up for the 98 percent of American families that make less than $250,000 a year - and it would mean more revenues for vital programs such as education, healthcare and Pell Grants as well as for efforts to stimulate job growth.\nAs President Obama said, \"We can either settle for an economy where a few people do really well and everyone else struggles to get by, or we can build an economy where hard work pays off again - where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules.\"\nThe White House website has a summary of the Buffett Rule, including a short video explaining how it would restore fairness to our tax system. The National Economic Council's report, \"The Buffett Rule: A Basic Principle of Tax Fairness,\" is available online.\nWith the Senate vote coming soon on the Paying a Fair Share Act, the AFT is urging members to contact their senators and ask them to support the legislation.

        "webpage": "Mark Hulbert\nIs the tide turning?\nCommentary: 99-week streak of bond fund inflows has come to end\nMarkHulbert\nCHAPEL HILL, NC (MarketWatch)  -  Is the Great Bond Bull Market finally coming to an end? Countless commentators (myself included) in recent months have concluded that it has, though in retrospect we've at best been premature  -  if not outright wrong. But there is the distinct possibility that this time may be different: The tide appears to be turning in the huge flow of funds into bond mutual funds and ETFs. That fund inflow  -  better described as a tsunami  -  has been widely noted over the past couple of years, of course, during which investors exhibited an insatiable appetite for bond funds, consistently transferring more money into those funds than they withdrew. In fact, according to TrimTabs Investment Research, a quantitative research firm, the sustained period of fund inflows into bond funds began nearly two years ago, in mid-December of 2008. The only other occasion in recent stock market history that even comes close to matching this, according to Vincent Deluard, Executive Vice President at Trim Tabs, is the sustained period of fund flows into stock mutual funds in the late 1990s leading up to the bursting of the Internet bubble. That's an ominous parallel, of course. But especially now, given that the string of weekly inflows into bond funds has finally been broken. That string, for those of you keeping score, was for 99 straight weeks. It came to an end in the week ending Nov. 17. For that week, Trim Tabs estimates that $4.3 billion was pulled out of open-end bond funds in the U.S. Though the pace of this outflow did not continue in the week ending Nov. 24, it didn't reverse itself either: Though TrimTabs estimates that there was a tiny inflow of $207 million into open-end bond bunds in that week, it was more than counterbalanced by a $592 million outflow from bond-oriented exchange-traded funds. What makes the bond market particularly vulnerable to this nascent turning of the tide is that it wouldn't take much to turn it into an avalanche just as big as the previous inflow. In an interview, Deluard pointed out that it's been 26 years since the bond market suffered a \"really severe correction. That means that the vast majority of investors in bond funds have never lived through a decline of that severity. This in turn means that, should a decline begin to gather steam, these inexperienced investors could easily panic and dump much of their bond fund holdings in very short order.\" That would cause the bond market to fall even faster, of course. To be sure, a two-week outflow doesn't in and of itself reverse 99 weeks of inflows. Nevertheless, given how precarious the situation is, what with huge inflows from inexperienced investors who could easily panic, it certainly appears as though the bond market is at a tipping point. If so, it won't take much to precipitate a huge rout in the bond market. \"They don't ring a bell at market tops,\" goes the old Wall Street saw. Nevertheless, if indeed a major bond bear market has begun, the outflows over the last two weeks might eventually be seen in retrospect as very close to just such a bell.\nMark Hulbert has been tracking the advice of more than 160 financial newsletters since 1980."

        "webpage": "Plan Would Force Public Companies To Reveal Political Giving\nShare Tweet E-mail Print By editor iStockphoto.com\nThe 2012 election was the most expensive in history, but there remain some gaping holes in our knowledge about who paid for what. The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a proposal to add more transparency in future elections, but it won't happen without a fight. The SEC proposal would require publicly traded companies to disclose all of their political contributions. And that would force companies to decide, in effect, if being linked to a candidate or partisan position is worth the impact political advocacy might have on its bottom line. Not surprisingly, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is vowing to fight the effort to tighten disclosure rules. SuperPACs And 'Social Welfare' Groups The Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling allowed corporations to give unlimited contributions to superPACs, but relatively few public companies have done so, perhaps because political action committees must disclose their donors. Watchdog groups think some public corporations have contributed to tax-exempt groups that fall under the 501(c) section of the tax code. These groups can engage in political activity  -  as long as they say their primary purpose is educational  -  and do not have to disclose their donors. Yet these \"social welfare\" groups include big political players, ranging from Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS to President Obama's Organizing for Action. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Crossroads GPS spent more than $70 million in 2012. Organizing for Action, which grew out of Obama's 2012 campaign, was formed after the election cycle. Its founders have pledged to refuse corporate contributions and disclose a list of donors. Most corporations also belong to 501(c)(6) organizations, like trade associations and chambers of commerce, which can engage in political activity. For example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent $35.7 million in 2012  -  and it's now leading the charge against the SEC's petition. Altogether, the Center for Responsive Politics estimates these tax-exempt groups spent at least $300 million in the 2012 election cycle. If the SEC does propose the new rule  -  an action it could take as early as next week  -  it would start a process that would include a comment period and public meetings. Enacting the rule also could spur legal action from opponents. Voluntary Transparency A study of the 2012 election cycle shows that many companies already are making at least some donations public, perhaps due to increased pressure from activists and shareholders. The Center for Political Accountability has been tracking voluntary disclosure by corporations since 2003. For the past two years, the group has compiled a ranking called the CPA-Zicklin Index, which found that 58 percent of the top 200 companies in the S&P 500 voluntarily disclosed some information about their political spending, and 85 percent of companies studied over two years improved their scores for political disclosure and accountability. Center for Political Accountability President Bruce Freed said that disclosure and accountability policies have become mainstream corporate governance practices. \"When we did the index in 2011, we were really, frankly, quite surprised at the results  -  really pleasantly surprised  -  when we found that there were companies that were adopting disclosure and accountability policies without having been engaged by investors,\" Freed said. \"They were doing it on their own.\" However, the group also found that 59 percent of companies did not disclose any information about payments to trade associations, and 75 percent did not disclose any contributions to tax-exempt social welfare groups. The Center for Responsive Politics has reported that some companies, including PepsiCo and Koch Industries, have lobbied against the SEC proposal during the first quarter of 2013. But Freed has found that other corporate representatives are frustrated by the varied patchwork of voluntary disclosures. \"I know from discussions with companies that there are a growing number of companies that will say privately, yes, we would like to see a rule because they see uniformity as in their self-interest,\" Freed said. \"It means that companies would be operating on a level playing field here.\" Kara Brandeisky is an intern on NPR's Washington Desk.Copyright 2013 NPR.

Are taxes accruing at too high a rate?\nIf they are, the company's earnings are penalized, and CFOs may want to rethink their policy. In fact, they may want to adopt the approach Southern Union employed, according to its February 25 10-K.\nSU, a gas company, has an equity-method investment in Citrus Corp., owning 50% of Citrus's outstanding stock. SU's partner in the venture, El Paso Corp., owns the remaining 50% of Citrus's stock.\nThe equity method of accounting is generally used by corporations that invest in other corporations and have an investment of 20% or more of the voting stock of the corporation; the original investment is recorded at the investor's cost. That original investment is then adjusted periodically to recognize the investor's proportionate share of the corporation's earnings or losses. Dividends received by the investor reduce the basis of its investment.\nIn SU's case, as in others, the equity-method investment produces taxable temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities must be recorded. But SU did not accrue such taxes at the maximum statutory 35% rate. Instead, it accrued taxes at a lower rate that is imposed on intercorporate dividends.\nSU provides the following reasoning for its position: \". . .due to the anticipated increase in dividends from Citrus. . .the company [SU] expects the entire deferred tax liability related to its investment in Citrus will be realized at the company's statutory income tax rate less the dividends received deduction. . . .\" (The italics are mine.)\nThus it appears that, stemming from the intercorporate dividends-received deduction, SU accrued deferred taxes on its investment in Citrus at only a 7% rate. The reason is that Section 243 of the Internal Revenue Code states that such companies will get a deduction of 80% of the amount received as dividends from a 20% or more owned corporation. Thus the effective tax rate imposed on SU's dividend income is 7%, since 20% of the dividend was taxed at the 35% rate.\nThe SU case is just another example of the role judgment can play in accounting for income taxes. SU is predicting that it will \"realize\" its investment in Citrus primarily through the extraction of dividends, and this prediction informs the amount of its deferred tax accruals. Other enterprises might adopt a more conservative approach and accrue deferred taxes on their investments at the statutory rate. It seems that either is allowed by the tax code, which appears to encourage the exercise of judgment when it comes to the accrual of deferred taxes.\nRobert Willens, founder and principal of Robert Willens LLC, writes a weekly tax column for CFO.com.\n\ufffd CFO Publishing Corporation 2009.

After nearly five years of economic crises, the European Union is also seeing more divergence between its member nations, particularly in the north, where economies have resilience, as opposed to the south, where unemployment rates are an average of more than 7 points higher. From Brussels, Teri Schultz filed this report for our Newscast desk: \"More Europeans are out of work now in the eurozone  -  almost 11.8 percent  -  than in the entire two-decade history of the common currency.\" \"Employment and Social Affairs Commissioner Lazlo Andor says joblessness plus cutbacks in governments' social spending mean poverty is on the rise.\" \"'After a few years of persistent crisis, most national welfare systems have lost much of their ability to protect household incomes against the effects of the crisis,'\" he says. \"Andor says the economic divide is growing between EU nations north and south. Spain has the highest unemployment, at 26.6 percent of the working-age population. Austria has the lowest, at 4.5 percent. Andor says he hopes this year's a turning point.\" That's quite a downward turn from early 2008, when the eurozone's unemployment rate hovered around 7.2 percent. The most recent statistics reflect the situation in November of 2012. In its coverage of the EU report, the German newspaper Die Welt used a headline that stated bluntly (and roughly translated here), \"The social structure in Europe is breaking apart.\" Here's some analysis from BBC Economics Correspondent Andrew Walker: \"The biggest rises, in percentage terms, were in countries at the centre of the eurozone financial crisis - Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal. One striking exception to that pattern was the Republic of Ireland where unemployment fell. \"The general trend however remains upwards and it makes it even harder for the governments concerned to collect the taxes they need to stabilise their debts.\" Copyright 2015 NPR.

Hillary Rodham Clinton (N.Y.) has distanced herself from the agreement, which her husband pushed through a Democratic Congress. \"NAFTA was a mistake to the extent that it did not deliver on what we had hoped it would, and that's why I call for a trade timeout,\" she now says.\nSuch demagoguery is worth matching against the facts about NAFTA's impact. Among nonpartisan economists, the consensus (as summarized in a 2004 Congressional Research Service report) is that while the bulk of increased trade between the United States and Mexico since NAFTA probably would have occurred anyway, the agreement's positive effects have increased over time. NAFTA did not cause the current U.S. trade deficit with Mexico ($64 billion last year, out of a $13.3 trillion U.S. economy). Nor did NAFTA cost the United States any jobs, on net, though it might have created a couple of hundred thousand. The agreement contributed marginally to the shifting of workers from some less competitive sectors to others. As for wages, a gap between higher- and lower-paid workers has indeed developed in the NAFTA years, but the main culprit is technology, which increases demand for highly educated and trained workers.\nNot that any of the Democratic candidates seem to care, but the impact of NAFTA seems to have been both larger and more positive in Mexico than in the United States. Mexico's gross domestic product, now more than $875 billion, has more than quadrupled since 1987. The poverty rate dropped 10 percentage points in the second half of the 1990s. Average wages have not grown and wage inequality remains a stubborn challenge, but pay grew most swiftly in the Mexican industries most exposed to trade, according to the World Bank. And Mexico, once considered the sick man of Latin America, has logged its progress while also accomplishing a mostly peaceful transition to multiparty democracy.\nA final verdict on NAFTA is not possible yet, because the last deferred provisions won't be phased in until Jan. 1, just two days before Iowans go to the caucuses. Among them is the long-awaited elimination of all remaining barriers on American corn exports to Mexico.

Advancing the Science of Sustainability\nWhich Government Bonds Have the Best Ecological Return-On-Investment?\nIn a world in which the traditional ways of valuing investments have proven less-than-reliable in recent months, Swiss investment firm Pictet Asset Management is gaining traction with a new type of bond fund: one which rates countries based on their ability to provide a high quality of life at a minimal ecological cost.\nOver the last several years, there has been a growing interest in \"Socially Responsible Investment\" (SRI) as people think not only about their financial legacy but also about the type of world they will leave to future generations, says Pictet Sustainability Expert Christoph Butz. Yet, while interest in SRI has grown, there are a limited number of SRI bond and fixed-income products on the market.\nPictet is expanding those offerings with a bond-rating system that aims to value countries based on their ecological return-on-investment. The countries that receive the highest bond ratings are those which, according to Butz, are able to create \"the highest standard of living per unit of nature.\"\nFor sustainable development to work, a country must have a stable government, so the first part of Pictet's rating system takes governance quality into account, evaluating such factors as rule of law, freedom of speech, public accountability and political stability, as measured by the World Governance Indicators used by the World Bank.\nThe second part of the rating system, unique to Pictet, evaluates investments through an entirely new lens. This rating is based upon a ratio of resource consumption - as measured by the Ecological Footprint -- to standard of living as measured by United Nation's Human Development Index, a measure that compares countries on its citizens' achievement of long lives, literacy, income and other factors.\nWith Pictet's system, \"You see very different countries emerging as the best rated,\" Butz says.\nWhile traditional bonds tend to flow investment to countries whose citizens have the highe"

        "webpage": "Military Retirement\nTime to Rally Around Roth?\nWith the threat of a big tax increase in January, investing in a Roth IRA now might be a good idea. Why? A Roth IRA is a source of potentially tax-free retirement income. Here are some other reasons why you might want to consider a Roth.\nThe Roth Rundown\nBefore exploring that move, it's important to understand why Roth IRAs can be appealing. \"That starts with the fact that qualified withdrawals of earnings are completely free from federal income tax,\" says Dan McNamara, president of USAA Investments. That means every dollar in your Roth can be used for retirement needs -- unlike traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, where withdrawal of earnings essentially comes with a tax bill attached.\nRoth IRAs also have a few more things going for them:\nNo required minimum distributions during the account owner's lifetime. Most tax-favored retirement accounts require you to start withdrawing money -- and paying taxes -- once you reach age 70\u00bd. That's not the case with Roths during your lifetime, which means your money can be left to grow.\nTax-planning flexibility. Having a pool of money that isn't subject to current income taxes gives you more tax-planning agility in retirement. For example, in a year where your other income is pushing you toward higher tax brackets or triggering taxes on your Social Security benefits, you can look to your Roth for money that is not currently taxed.\nA way to leave a potentially tax-free legacy. Beneficiaries of traditional retirement accounts don't just inherit your money -- they inherit a tax bill, too, because they'll owe taxes when they cash in just like you would have. With Roth IRAs, you can potentially leave an income tax-free inheritance. \"With proper planning, Roth IRAs can even stretch tax-free income over multiple generations,\" says McNamara.\nThe potential for future tax savings. Although you won't receive a current-year federal income tax deduction for making a Roth IRA contribution, you will be able to grow the contribution tax-deferred and ultimately use the contribution and any account-qualified earnings tax-free while in retirement. The value of future tax savings associated with any tax-free earnings on the contribution could exceed the value of the tax savings associated with making a pretax contribution to a traditional IRA or employer-sponsored plan. Having said that, you should usually contribute to your employer-sponsored plan at least to the extent of an employer match to ensure you \"don't leave money on the table,\" says McNamara.\nThere are three ways to add a Roth to your retirement mix:\nContribute to a Roth IRA. This is only an option if you have earned income and your modified adjusted gross income for 2012 is less than $125,000 ($183,000 for married couples filing jointly). For a married individual filing a separate return who is covered by a retirement plan at work, the phase-out range is $0 to $10,000. For 2012, you can contribute up to $5,000; if you'll be 50 or older at year's end, the limit is $6,000. For 2013, the limit increases to $5,500; if you are 50 or older at year's end, the limit is $6,500.\nParticipate in a Roth employer plan. Historically, most employee contributions to work-related retirement plans were made on a pretax basis. Today, many employers provide a Roth option. Like their Roth IRA cousins, a Roth 401(k), 403(b) or Thrift Savings Plan provide no benefit of a deduction on your current tax return when you contribute but offer potentially tax-free withdrawals in retirement.\nConvert. Anyone can move money to a Roth IRA from a traditional IRA or, if your plan permits it, from a 401(k) or other employer plan. You'll pay a price for that potentially future tax-free income: Generally, you'll owe income tax on the money you move unless the money was contributed to a traditional IRA account after taxes. Unfortunately, you can't move only that money -- the IRS uses a formula that taxes the amount you move based on the proportions of pretax and after-tax money in your account.\nTiming Can Be Everything\nConverting generally makes the most sense when you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement (when you need to take withdrawals from the account) than at the time of conversion. For example, if you are subject to a current 25% tax rate, consider converting to the Roth account and taking potentially tax-free distributions when you'd otherwise have to pay tax at a 28% rate.\nUnless Congress acts, nearly every American faces higher tax rates starting Jan. 1. \"If that happens, converting in 2012 could be cheaper than waiting until next year,\" says McNamara. For example, picture a married couple with $150,000 of taxable income and a $50,000 traditional IRA funded entirely by pretax contributions. If they convert their IRA in 2012, they'd pay $14,000 for the privilege. If they convert it in 2013, the same move would cost $15,500  -  almost 11% more.\nIt's important to consider that, even if Congr"

Large banks have larger, dedicated legal and compliance staff and can more easily absorb regulatory costs. Credit unions and other nonbank institutions that perform \"bank-like\" functions and offer comparable bank products and services are not subject to the same taxation, laws and regulations as community banks. This uneven playing field places community banks at a competitive disadvantage and inhibits their ability to serve their customers and their communities.\nICBA's Plan for Prosperity (\"Plan\") for the 114th Congress is a \"legislative platform\" or set of community bank priorities positioned for advancement. In legislation, the Plan is best represented by the House and Senate versions of the CLEAR Relief Act (H.R. 1233 and S. 812), and the Community Bank Access to Capital Act (H.R. 1523 and S. 1816). H.R. 1233 has over 100 bipartisan cosponsors, and S. 812 has 37 bipartisan cosponsors. The Financial Regulatory Improvement Act, S. 1484, which passed the Senate Banking Committee on May 21, 2015 includes a number of robust regulatory relief provisions. Three PFP provisions were signed into law in 2015: (i) an 18-month exam cycle for CAMELS 1 and 2 banks with assets of less than $1 billion: (ii) easier qualification for \"rural lender\" status under CFPB mortgage rules by elimination of the requirement that such lenders operate \"predominantly\" in rural areas; and (iii) elimination of annual privacy notice mailings when a bank has not changed its privacy policies. Nine PFP bills have passed the House, and approximately 50 PFP bills have been introduced in the House and Senate. ICBA will press for the enactment of additional PFP bills in 2016.\nICBA strongly supports a system of tiered regulation - regulatory and supervisory policies that differentiate between community banks and other financial services providers. The Dodd-Frank Act provided for tiered regulation in several areas including an exemption for banks with assets of less than $10 billion from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau examination and enforcement, and indemnification of banks with assets of less than $10 billion from FDIC premium increases that will result from increasing the Deposit Insurance Fund minimum reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent. Other examples of tiered regulation can be found in the final Basel III rule including allowing banks under $250 billion to continue to use the Basel I mortgage risk weights, the exclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from the definition of regulatory capital, and the grandfathering of tier one treatment of trust preferred securities (TruPS) for banks with assets under $15 billion. In addition, the CFPB made some special accommodations for certain community banks under the \"ability-to-repay/qualified mortgage\" rule and the mortgage servicing rule. While these provisions are significant, much more is needed. The basic framework of financial regulation should be based on the principle of tiering proportionate to size, business model, complexity, and risk.\nThe regulatory agencies should take full advantage of the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) process, a two-year review of financial regulations to identify outdated, unnecessary or unduly burdensome regulations. ICBA has developed a set of recommendations intended to ensure that the process results in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks, as intended by Congress. For more information, see the separate resolution on EGRPRA.\nICBA will continue to advocate for meaningful regulatory reforms including tiered regulation for community banks, their customers, and their communities.\nStaff Contacts: Brian Cooney and Chris Cole\nReturn to ICBA Policy Resolutions"

It's just getting started, and the most innovative companies are the ones you haven't yet heard of.\n\nLast week, at London's Innovate Finance Global Summit, we got to hear fintech's biggest thought leaders comment on the state of the industry today. Across panels, interviews and fireside discussions, the speakers expressed enthusiasm that \"Fintech\" is finally beginning to climb the value chain in financial services, as the spotlight shifts away from consumer-focused companies and towards B2B, white label and enterprise solutions.\n\nB2C Fintech isn't disruptive (yet)\n\nThought leaders were quick to dismiss the overplayed \"disruption\" narrative as inappropriate for fintech. As Matthias Kroner, the CEO of Fidor Bank commented, \"Disruption contains a mass factor, and today fintech is not mass relevant\" when comparing its customer base to that of the major incumbent players in financial services.\n\nFor the past few years, most fintech has focused on p2p lending, payments, remittances and robo-advisors, which served a direct need for consumers, who were still feeling the anti-bank sentiment from the 2008 financial crisis. Nick Hungerford, the CEO of Nutmeg, noted that the most important task in 2010 was rebuilding consumer trust in the wealth management industry. At the time, a product with transparent pricing and a friendly UX interface was a good place to start.\n\nIn 2015, 14 of 18 fintech unicorns were in payments & lending. This is changing as the industry matures.\n\nLipstick on a pig\n\nWhile robo-advisors, challenger banks, and other B2C companies were early innovators who brought \"fintech\" into the public eye, they are all built upon existing \"old pipe\" infrastructure. To Matthias Kroner, a pretty UX on top of existing infrastructure is just \"lipstick on a pig,\" and the solutions with staying power will be the ones that work with incumbent players to improve their offerings, inside and out.\n\nBig changes behind the scenes\n\nIn North American and European markets, thought leaders expect the most disruption to occur in back offices, through collaboration between startups and large institutions. The CEO of DueDil, Damian Kimmelman, observed that fintech has been \"chipping away\" at bank market share from the outside, but is only just beginning to transform institutions from the inside out. Tomorrow's fintech successes won't be seen as disruptors, but enablers.\n\nHello from London! - Roko, Henry & the TradeIt balloon.\n\nThrough the use of APIs, blockchain technologies, the cloud, and data analytics, financial institutions can cut out real inefficiencies in their infrastructure. Today, only 3% of finance executives have a tech background. For those institutions who fear becoming irrelevant, this is already changing as they adopt more data-driven strategies and work with fast-paced startups to improve their product. Eventually, ten-year decisions will be achieved in ten minutes, allowing institutions to be truly responsive to their customers' needs.\n\nHow incumbents remain relevant\n\nFor incumbent firms in financial services, thought leaders prescribed a two-step journey to continued relevance:\n\nWelcome the new technology that is available\n\nChange the culture, otherwise, don't even bother with the technology.\n\nIn November, the Barclays CEO warned of an \"Uber moment\" in financial services, and the industry has picked apart the metaphor ever since. With high customer acquisition costs, slow sales cycles, and a hugely established market, financial services is likely to experience more collaboration than disruption.\n\nThe programming at Innovate Finance Global Summit showcased an industry that is excited to power this wave of collaboration, as B2B tech solutions eclipse the earlier customer-focused fintech companies, improving the incumbents from the inside out, rather than putting lipstick on a pig."

This is 40,800 more than in July and a record since the ministry began collecting comparable data in 1991.\n\"These three million unemployed embody the failure of economic and social policies undertaken during the last few years,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\"In the face of this difficult report, the government is determined to implement as soon as possible\" reforms, it said.\nWith the number of people out of work already reaching 2.99 million in July, the French government had expected a further rise in August, with Labour Minister Michel Sapin saying in early September that the symbolic figure of three million had been breached.\nFrench President Francois Hollande earlier this month pledged to reverse the trend in a year's time, a target that Sapin said Tuesday was \"reachable\".\nHowever, an economist at the French Economic Observatory, Eric Heyer, believes that annual growth of 1 percent is necessary to stabilise the rate of unemployment and that 1.5 to 2 percent in growth is needed to reduce the number of people out of a job.\nThe government has forecast 0.3 percent growth for the year, and has so far kept its 2013 target at 1.2 percent, which most economists now consider unrealistic.\nFrance's central bank this month predicted that the eurozone's second biggest economy would contract by 0.1 percent in the third quarter after flat-lining for the first half of the year.\nAmid the gloom, French consumer confidence slipped two points in September from the previous month, the national statistics office said earlier Wednesday.\nThe consumer confidence index fell to 85 points from 87 in July and 90 in June, figures released by INSEE showed.\nThe data came a day after another set of INSEE figures showed French business leaders and industrialists deeply pessimistic about their business prospects.\nIn line with a pact agreed by eurozone leaders earlier this year, France is committed to reducing the size of its deficit from around 4.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year to 3.0 percent in 2013 and to balance the budget by 2017.\nHollande, who took power in March, unveils his first budget on Friday, which is aimed at generating 30 billion euros in new taxes and savings to plug a budget gap and to kickstart the flagging economy.\nSlashing government overspending is seen as vital to ensure the survival of the euro amid a lingering debt crisis but economists have warned that a sluggish economy and the impact of the planned fiscal measures will make it hard for these targets to be met.\n(AFP) Date created : 2012-09-27\nHollande unveils two-year plan, billions in new taxes\nFrance heading back towards recession\nFrench lawmakers approve tax hike on rich"

He said enrollment has fallen in the university's commercial bank management course since the financial crisis. By Deon Roberts / The Charlotte Observer\nFive years after the financial crisis, some small and midsize banks say they are having a hard time filling core positions -- in part because graduating finance majors are more leery of going to work in traditional banking jobs.\nBanking insiders blame the talent shortage on multiple causes, including the loss of training programs at large banks, turnover within banks and the growth of other types of jobs in financial services.\nCollege students with a general understanding of banking could help fill the void. But some students worry that the banking industry offers too little job security, a perception forged by years of negative headlines since the financial crisis, bankers and academics say.\nDaryl Kerr, associate dean for undergraduate programs at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte's Belk College of Business, said business students' No. 1 worry about working for a bank is job security.\n\"They see financial institutions laying off,\" he said. \"I hear a lot of them talking about that.\"\n\"Banking as an industry ... does feel like maybe it's a little bit less stable, maybe it's a little bit more dangerous,\" said Joseph Hiatt, a UNC-Charlotte finance major.\nTony Plath, a UNC-Charlotte professor who teaches finance courses, said enrollment has fallen in the university's commercial bank management course since the financial crisis. The course enrolled 91 students in 2006-07, according to the university. Last year, it was 13. This fall, it's up to 39.\nThe reluctance of students is potentially bad news for banks that want to groom interns who can be moved into positions that become open when more experienced bankers leave or move up within the company.\nJohn Hipp, CEO of Charlotte-based New Dominion Bank, said banks are turning to one another for help in finding job candidates.\n\"This is honest-to-God the truth: I have another community banker here in town wanting us to send them the names of anybody that we didn't hire, because they couldn't find or source commercial bankers,\" Mr. Hipp said.\nBut even if more students pursue banking, some wonder whether small banks will be able to attract them -- especially if they worry about job security. That's because some small banks are still struggling to be profitable, leading many in the industry to predict more acquisitions.\n\"I think a lot of people are worried about what the future of banking, particularly if you're at a small bank, may be for you,\" said R. Patterson Jackson, CEO of Newport Beach, Calif.-based Sabal Financial Group.\nRetired Bank of America CEO Hugh McColl Jr. acknowledges that the banking industry's image has been damaged in the financial crisis. But the industry will recover and generate plenty of jobs, he said.\n\"They may be run differently, and certainly the delivery systems will be different because of the Internet. That being said, there will be plenty of jobs,\" Mr. McColl said.\n\"The banking business has been with us forever -- for centuries -- going back to biblical times. And it's not going away.\""

In places where it's sunny most of the summer, we wouldn't leave our house each morning packing coats and umbrellas just in case. The weather's predictable. But in the winter and other seasons when the weather can quickly change, we head out with a different mindset.\" For businesses, switching gears to deal with inclement economic conditions involves adopting new perspectives and practices, she says. \"I incorporated some of these in 'The Merger Mogul' because it's set during the recession and my protagonist, the mogul, had to adapt,\" Every says. \"He used many of the strategies I teach my business clients for thriving during economic uncertainty.\" What are some of those strategies? Every outlines them: \u2022 Build on what you have, not toward what you want: Instead of setting goals and then seeking out the resources you'll need to meet them, assess what you have available and decide what you can achieve with that. This not only saves you the time and expense of pulling together resources you may not have, it also gives you the advantage of working from your business's individual and unique strengths. \u2022 Follow the Las Vegas rule: Tourists planning a weekend in Las Vegas will often set aside the amount of money they're willing to gamble - and lose -- on cards or the slots. That way, they won't lose more than they can afford. During an uncertain economy, entrepreneurs should calculate their risks the same way. Rather than going for the biggest opportunities as you would in prosperous times, look for the opportunities that won't require as much of your resources. Calculate how much you can afford to lose, and always consider the worst-case scenario. \u2022 Join hands and hearts: Competition is fine when things are going well, but when times are tough, you need allies. Explore forming partnerships with other entrepreneurs so you can strategize to create opportunities together. With what your partners bring to the table, you'll have more strength and new options to work with. \u2022 Capitalize on the unexpected: Surprises can have positive outcomes if you handle them nimbly by finding ways to use them to your advantage. Instead of planning damage control for the next unexpected contingency, look at it as an opportunity. Get creative as you look for the positives it presents. \u2022 When life is unpredictable, don't try to forecast: Focus on what you can do and create now rather than what you can expect based on what happened in the past. In good times, that information can be a helpful and reliable way to make predictions, but savvy entrepreneurs don't count on that in uncertain times. \"While the U.S. economy certainly is improving, there's still too much uncertainty both here and abroad to go back to the old ways of doing business just yet,\" Every says. \"If you've survived the past five years, you've probably been relying on many of these strategies - maybe without even realizing it,\" she says. \"Don't abandon them yet, and if there are some here you aren't using, work toward incorporating them, too.\" About Donna Every Donna Every is director of Arise Consulting Inc., a company that offers business training, and consulting services.

To adjust for company size, annual compound growth rates (CAGR) and percentage changes for stock price were also factored.\n\nDuring the five year period between 2005/09, the super sponsors outperformed other Standard & Poor (S&P) companies in three of the four key performance indicators.\nThe super sponsors who had the highest net income growth over the five-year period were General Motors (107.9%), Anheuser-Busch (35.0%), Ford (26.0%), AT&T (19.7%) and Procter & Gamble (13.5%).\n\nAll but three of the super sponsors (Bank of America, Verizon and FedEx) posted higher net income growth than the average of the S&P 500 index (6.50%). The top super sponsors in terms of growth in earnings per share were General Motors (111.8%), McDonald's (16.8%), AT&T (10.9%) and Nike (10.2%).\n\nAll but two of the companies (Anheuser-Busch and Verizon) posted earnings per share growth rates that exceeded the S&P 500 index average of 6.97%.\nIn terms of stock price appreciation, the super sponsors declined by an average of 0.64%, compared to a decrease of 7.94% for the S&P 500 index. The super sponsors who realised the highest percentage increase in stock price were McDonald's (96.2%), Visa (66.7%), Nike (45.7%) and Coca-Cola (37.2%).\n\nIn addition to achieving higher than market averages, the super sponsors also outperformed the companies on the list who invested in sponsorship at a below-average level, in revenue growth, net income growth and earnings per share growth.\n\nAs a group, the companies who invested an average of $33.7 million per year in sponsorship (versus an average of US$160 million per year by super sponsors) had an average revenue growth of 6.56%, average net income growth of 0.07% and average EPS growth of 3.03%. As a group, the 35 peer companies realised a mean stock price increase of 3.85%.\n\n\"We do not suggest a causal relationship between investment in sponsorship and business performance,\" Professor Jensen commented in a statement.\n\n\"Rather, it is our theory that these companies have consistently outperformed peer companies who spend less on sponsorship and due to the fact that they already enjoy the benefits of their brands being more established and valuable compared to their peers, which contributes to better company performance over time. Their consistent investment in sponsorship is reflective of their efforts to continue to nurture their brands, which, according to branding experts, are among some of the most valuable in the world.\""

The consensus in Washington  -  as detailed by the Washington Post and the New York Times  -  is that we need to share the pain, though pain in Washington-speak really means cutting Social Security and Medicare.\nThe New York Times, for instance, in an editorial in the days immediately following the release of the report from the president's deficit reduction commission, that it said the report offered \"no-nonsense talk that the country needs,\" saying \"what almost nobody in Washington is daring to say.\" The Post, for its part, said the commission's contribution \"has been to hammer home the inescapable point that there is no realistic way to attain fiscal solvency without a combination of spending cuts and tax increases.\" Both specifically mentioned Social Security and Medicare, entitlement programs that have been in both papers' crosshairs for quite some time.\nFailure to come to consensus is a failure of politics, an unwillingness on the part of both political parties to risk short-term pain for long-term fiscal gain that can only damage the country's prospects in the future. Or so goes the argument being made by the papers and the new breed of deficit hawks.\nBut it is not the politics that is the issue. Rather, the inability to win consensus reflects deep philosophical differences - and, on the part of the left, a legitimate opposition to a set of proposals that are skewed against the middle class and poor and favor those with the cash.\nMainstream Washington might be fixated on the deficit (at a time of high unemployment, a fact that boggles the mind), but there are economists willing to challenge the capital consensus. Dean Baker, at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a populist liberal economist, questions the basic assumptions on which the battle to beat the deficit is built:\n\"The fundamental premise of the commission is that the country suffers from serious deficit problems that Congress is unable to address through its normal processes,\" he said. \"This view does not correspond with the facts as can be easily shown.\"\nBaker cites Congressional Budget Office numbers  -  a 1.3 point increase in spending as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product over 40 years  -  that demonstrate that there \"has been no explosion of spending whatsoever\" and nothing more than \"an invention of those with their own agenda.\"\nMore to the point, he adds, \"the rise in the deficit in the downturn has been essential for sustaining demand in the economy\" and \"projections of longer-term budget problems are almost entirely due to a projected explosion in health care costs.\"\nSlashing Medicare  -  as the deficit hawks insist  -  will not address the problem. Instead, that will just push healthcare costs back onto American seniors. The fact is that the United States \"pays more than twice as much per person for its health care as other wealthy countries with the same or longer life expectancies,\" Baker says. \"This ratio is projected to rise to three and four to one in the decades ahead.\"\nAnd that does not take into account other medical outcomes - on which the United States ranks far lower than one might expect.\nThe Obama health reforms may offer some minor assistance at the margins of the American healthcare labyrinth, but it will not measurably control costs. Only a single-payer, Medicare-for-all system will do that, by taking profit out of the system and expanding the coverage pool.\nThe way to attack the deficit is to fix health care and to put Americans to work in good-paying jobs, which would generate far more in new revenue than could be save by shortsighted cuts of unnecessary tax reform. But that's not on the agenda in Washington.\nHank Kalet is a regional editor with Patch.com in New Jersey.

Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nChicago and the Boston area, the respective campaign headquarters of Democratic President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, are appropriate locations to present forums on immigration policy, Bloomberg said.\n\"Immigration is what built this country, immigration is what kept this country going for the past 235 years and now we seem to have walked away from it,\" Bloomberg said today in Chicago. \"Both candidates have been supportive of immigration when they were running earlier, appeared to be in favor of making changes and yet -- nothing.\"\nHe called for visa laws that would make it easier for educated medical and technical workers as well as low-wage and seasonal farm laborers to gain entry to the U.S. Easing those laws has been a signature issue for Bloomberg, who in June 2011 said the U.S. wouldn't remain a global superpower \"if we continue to close our doors to the people who want to come here and work hard.\" The mayor has described restrictive immigration laws as \"national suicide.\"\nFailed policies\n\"Washington has failed to enact immigration policies that acknowledge the role of immigrants in our economic successes, or consistently support the employment needs of America's businesses,\" Murdoch said in a statement.\nThe day's first forum, at the Economic Club of Chicago, will feature a conversation between Bloomberg and former White House Chief of Staff William Daley moderated by Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC. Murdoch will join Bloomberg in a second forum in Boston moderated by Gerald Seib of the Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau, the partnership said in a news release.\nThe report, written by Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, analyzed U.S. Census data, including national population and business- owner surveys, to conclude that immigrants, who account for 12.9 percent of the population, started 28 percent of all new U.S. businesses in 2011. In 1996, immigrants founded 15 percent of all new businesses, the report said.\nImmigrants are more than twice as likely to start a business as the native-born, according to the report. In 2011, the immigrant business-formation rate was 550 new businesses per month for every 100,000 immigrants, while the native-born rate was 270 for every 100,000, according to the report.\nThe mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.\nimmigration, rhode island, u.s., immigrant-owned businesses, partnership for a new american economy, michael bloomberg, rupert murdoch Print"

        "webpage": "Michigan's Tax and Business Incentive Climate\nBy Michael D. LaFaive, published on May 5, 2008\n(Author's Note: On April 18, 2008, I was asked to provide five minutes worth of remarks on questions involving economic development in Michigan at a forum held in downtown Midland. I was happy to do so.)\nQuestion No. 3: What is the tax and business incentives climate in Michigan? How does it affect our economic development abilities?\nTax and business incentives in Michigan are greatly overdone and have expanded to such a degree that they now include refundable tax credits. But exhaustive research has shown that, at best, state and local development efforts have no impact on real economic growth.\nFirst, and in the broadest sense, research from 2002 indicates that state and local units of government expend about $50 billion annually on business incentives with no apparent impact. In your folder is a META review of the literature titled \"The Failure of Economic Development Incentives.\" A META review is essentially a review of reviews of scholarly literature on a particular topic. This review encompasses a \"massive\" amount of research literature and concludes that there were \"theoretical, empirical and practical [reasons] to believe that economic development incentives have little or no impact on firm location and investment decisions.\"\nSecond, it does not appear that Michigan has fared any better. In 2005 I published a 127-page review of Michigan's premier economic development program, known as MEGA, the Michigan Economic Growth Authority. This study included a powerful time-series econometric model that was peer reviewed by one of the authors of this META review. We proved that MEGA had no impact on employment, the unemployment rate or per-capita personal income statewide, or in counties where firms who got the tax breaks are located. Every $123,000 in MEGA tax credits promised resulted in a single construction job, but those jobs existed for no more than two years. Moreover, counties hosting a MEGA company did no better or worse than those without MEGA recipients. To date, neither the MEDC (Michigan Economic Development Corp.) nor the Legislature has  -  to my knowledge  -  refuted a single point of fact in this study. This should be a source of deep embarrassment to both institutions, particularly in light of MEGA's continued state support and expansion. We do not blame companies for taking what is offered, but the incentives should not be offered in the first place.\nThird, and concerning Michigan's local development work, is the subject of property tax abatements. Last year two scholars from Michigan State University and Wayne State University (Gary Sands and Laura Reese) unveiled their comprehensive study on local property tax abatements in Michigan. They concluded that \"data on the number of PA 198 certificates issued by individual communities from 1980 to 2001\nfail to show a clear, consistent relationship between abatement activity and change in economic health.\" This was not the first study to come to that conclusion. In short, these incentive games do not work. A better alternative is for government to distinguish itself with broader-based policy changes at both the state and local levels. Cutting taxes and spending and rolling back unnecessary regulation would do far more for incentivizing business development and expansion. That means passing right-to-work legislation, eliminating the Michigan Business Tax, cutting local taxes, reining in the Department of Environmental Quality and eliminating zoning regulations.\n(Addendum: All too often, those who defend government economic development programs argue that scrapping such programs would be the equivalent of \"unilateral disarmament\" in the economic war between the states. Not true. If it doesn't work it is not unilateral disarmament because it was never armament in the first place. Ultimately, those who play the incentive game are fighting over job announcements, not real jobs.)\nMichael D.

This update is in the form of an new Annex to the Guidelines that provides guidance on conducting advance pricing arrangements under the mutual agreement procedure (MAP APAs). The Annex became an integral part of the Guidelines as shown by the decision of the OECD Council on 28 October 1999 to amend its original Recommendation concerning the Guidelines in 1995 so as to incorporate the new guidance in this Annex. It therefore has the same status as the existing eight Chapters of the Guidelines.\nAn APA is an administrative approach that attempts to prevent transfer pricing disputes from arising by determining criteria for applying the arm's length principle to transactions in advance of those transactions taking place. This contrasts with traditional audit techniques that look to whether transactions, which have already taken place, reflect the application of the arm's length principle. Such approaches were relatively novel at the time the 1995 Guidelines were adopted by the OECD Council and so the Committee on Fiscal Affairs stated at paragraph 4.161 of the Transfer Pricing Guidelines that it intended \"to monitor carefully any expanded use of APAs and to promote greater consistency in practice amongst those countries that choose to use them.\" Further, it is stated at 4.163 of the Guidelines that, \"wherever possible, an APA should be concluded on a bilateral or multilateral basis between competent authorities through the mutual agreement procedure of the relevant treaty.\"\nThe publication of this Annex is intended as a response to both the above recommendations and is also intended to make the MAP APA process more transparent, more efficient and produce more consistent results. Further, publication should help the efforts of the Committee on Fiscal Affairs to associate non-member Countries with the 1995 Guidelines, since the guidance is intended for use by those countries - both OECD Members and non-members - that wish to use APAs.\nThe Annex starts off by defining the different types of APA and outlines the objectives of the APA process. The eligibility for entering into a MAP APA is examined in relation to treaty issues and to other factors such as the audit status of the taxpayer. The issues around multilateral APAs (i.e. where there is more than one bilateral mutual agreement) are also discussed. The core of the Annex looks in detail at the whole MAP APA process, starting from pre-filing meetings, moving on to the filing of a proposal, its evaluation by the tax authorities, the discussion and conclusion of the mutual agreement, the implementation of that mutual agreement and finally the monitoring of the agreement and possible renewal. Although the focus of the Annex is on giving guidance to tax authorities, the opportunity is taken to discuss how best the taxpayer can contribute to the process."

The goal would be to get the economy growing at a faster pace, he said.\nGreenspan's comments - part of the central bank's twice-yearly report to lawmakers - signaled that the Fed, which has already reduced a key interest rate to the lowest level since 1958, is prepared to cut rates again. This could happen as soon as its next meeting on Aug. 12 if the economy is not showing convincing signs of a post-Iraq rebound.\nThe Fed \"stands ready to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for as long as it takes to achieve a satisfactory economic performance,\" Greenspan said in testimony to the House Financial Services Committee.\nAt its last meeting on June 25, the central bank's interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee cut the funds rate by a quarter-point to 1 percent. The next day banks reduced their prime rate to 4 percent, the lowest for this benchmark rate for millions of consumer and business loans since 1959.\nThe central bank had signaled at its May meeting that it was concerned that inflation had fallen to such a low level in this country that there was a danger that the sluggish economy might actually trigger a prolonged bout of deflation. That would be a destabilizing period in which prices are actually falling, something not experienced in the United States since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nGreenspan told House lawmakers on Tuesday that the Fed remained worried about the possibility of deflation, even though he characterized such an outcome as remote. If it occurred, it would threaten extensive damage, he said, especially if the economy were to be hit by any type of shock.\n\"A very low inflation rate increases the risk that an adverse shock to the economy would be more difficult to counter effectively,\" Greenspan said.\nThe quarter-point reduction in the funds rate last month disappointed many investors on Wall Street, who had been expecting a larger half-point reduction. Some analysts speculated that the Fed might have gone for the smaller rate move in an attempt to conserve the limited amount of rate cuts it had remaining.\nSome economists said the Fed would want to stop well short of 0 percent on the funds rate, possibly cutting no further than 0.5 percent or 0.75 percent, because of the need to leave money market mutual funds with enough of a margin to meet expenses and still pay a return to their investors.\nHowever, in his testimony Tuesday, Greenspan debunked that view, saying that financial firms had demonstrated \"considerable flexibility\" in the past in finding ways to make a profit even at low interest rates.\n\"With the target funds rate at 1 percent, substantial further conventional easings could be implemented if the FOMC judged such policy actions warranted,\" he said.\nGreenspan said that he and other members of the FOMC discussed at some length at the June meeting the possibility of using \"alternatives\" for influencing interest rates beyond the Fed's conventional lever of adjusting the federal funds rate. Greenspan said that Fed policy-makers had concluded that it was \"unlikely\" that these methods, such as buying longer-term securities, would have to be used.\nGreenspan presented the committee with the Fed's latest economic forecasting, predicting that the economy would grow this year in a range of 2.5 percent to 2.75 percent. That represented a significant cut from the Fed's Febraury forecast, when it had predicted growth this year would be a faster rate of between 3.25 percent to 3.5 percent.\nThe economy, weighed down early in the year by falling consumer and business confidence reflecting worries about the Iraq war, has shown disappointing growth so far in 2003. The sluggish growth pushed the unemployment rate to a nine-year high of 6.4 percent in June.\nGreenspan in his testimony noted a number of promising developments that the economy should post stronger growth in the second half of his year, including the fall in interest rates and President Bush's latest round of tax cuts.\nFor 2004, the Fed predicted a significant rebound in economic growth to 3.75 percent to 4.75 percent, a rate that the Fed said could bring the unemployment down to as low as 5.5 percent by the end of the year.\nGreenspan emphasized that the central bank was prepared to leave interest rates low for as long as necessary to achieve this optimstic forecast because of a belief that the threat of deflation, not inflation, was the biggest concern at the moment.\n\"Policy accommodation aimed at raising the growth of output, boosting the utilization of resources and warding off unwelcome disinflation can be maintained for a considerable period without ultimately stoking inflation pressures,\" Greenspan said."

        "webpage": "Foreign Policy In Focus Lagarde's Victory: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back?\nWhat might seem like a victory for women may instead be a defeat for developing countries.\nBy Esther Ohrt, July 21, 2011. Print\nChristine Lagarde became the first female to head the IMF on July 5 2011. Since the IMF was established, it has been dominated by Europeans and men. Only six of 30 senior executives and 21.5 percent of all managers have been women, and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) control only 10.8 percent of IMF votes. In this context, Lagarde's position in the IMF is a great victory for women, but it still leaves developing countries with little power.\nIf the position had gone to the Mexican central bank leader Agustin Cartens, who is also well qualified for the position, he could have brought in a new perspective to the organization. Today many in the developing world continue to be frustrated with the IMF's structure since it doesn't reflect the shifting power balance in the global economy. As the Latin America News Dispatch characterized the situation, \"Carstens, who gained the backing Latin American nations like Chile and Peru as well as Australia and Canada, believes that emerging markets need to play a much larger role in setting the agenda of the IMF.\"\nI recently attended the National Organization for Women's conference in Florida where participants debated the lack of female leaders. Female role models in positions of power could change this situation. Therefore Lagarde's victory has given me a sense of hope that women can be as ambitious as men. Not only is she the first female leader of the IMF, but she is also the first non-economist to lead the IMF. One of her goals during her term is to increase the presence of developing countries in the organization. She has vowed to give China the third-strongest voice in the organization and to give more voice to countries like Brazil and South Korea.\nNot only does she want to create more culture diversity but also gender diversity. Thus, she could bring a new sensibility to the IMF in terms of its policies toward women. She believes that a gender-dominated environment is not healthy. She often says that \"too much testosterone\" is a problem for the financial sector. Therefore, we can expect Lagarde to enhance women's position and rights in the IMF.\nAlthough Lagarde promises to diversify the organization, I still believe as a Ghanaian citizen that the position should have been given to a non-European, in particular a woman from a developing country.\nOne possible candidate is Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala the recently appointed finance minister of Nigeria and a former managing director of the World Bank. Okonjo-Iweala was notable for being the first female minister of finance and minister of foreign affairs under President Olusegun Obasanjo from 2003-2006. Okonjo-Iweala graduated from Harvard University and earned her Ph.D in regional economics and development from MIT. She helped Nigeria obtain its first sovereign debt rating and helping slash Nigeria's debt by almost $30 billion. Today she is a role model for many Nigerians and Africans at large, in particular women, and the IMF would do well to consider her for its next leader.\nEsther Ohrt is a Foreign Policy in Focus intern.\nIssues: Human RightsRegions: Europe & Central AsiaTags: Christine Lagarde, IMF, International Monetary Fund Focal Points Blog\nAbout We sniff out issues hiding in the foreign-policy forest and haul them back to the laboratory for inspection.

Instead, a discussion ensued that several leaders said they found useful.\n\"It was a very calm and open meeting,\" the official said.\n\"At one point one of the prime ministers mentioned his concerns about rising unit labor costs at home and asked the Portuguese prime minister to talk about his experiences with tackling the problem.\"\nAfter the meeting, Merkel said she had found it helpful.\n\"We had very interesting reports from Mario Draghi. They mainly concentrated on the question: How can we improve our competitiveness,\" she said.\n\"In some countries the course for productivity and wages is responsible for the high unemployment today.\"\nDraghi, a former head of the Italian central bank and a former professor at the University of Florence, gave a shortened version of his presentation to all 27 EU leaders earlier on Thursday, and the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, also talked to leaders about low productivity.\nIn his address, Barroso emphasized how cutting labor costs and raising productivity can help stimulate exports, and showed how countries such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain had turned current account deficits into surpluses in the past year.\nAnother official briefed on Draghi's presentation, which took place on the 8th floor of the summit building, with the leaders each given a packet of A4 graphs and charts to consult, described it as aiming to hitting three points.\n\"His main message was about the importance of, as he called it, competitiveness, confidence and credit, or the 'three cs',\" the banking official said.\nDraghi also talked about the problem of monetary policy transmission - getting lending going again in the real economies of all corners of the euro zone - and in particular how changes to bank rules had created an uneven playing field between Europe and the United States.\n(Additional reporting by Andreas Rinke and John O'Donnell; writing by Luke Baker, editing by Mike Peacock)"

Anthony Broccoli, a Rutgers University professor of atmospheric science, said there is already proof that \"climate change does alter the probability of extreme events.\"\"We know that there is a new normal,\" Broccoli, director of Rutgers' Climate and Environmental Change Initiative, said at the event at Monmouth University. He added, \"All we have to do is look at the changes that have taken place on our shoreline.\"Hosted by the planning advocacy group New Jersey Future, the event at times touched on the role that the private sector will play in rebuilding the region. Megan Linkin, a vice president with Swiss Reinsurance America Holding Corp., said the exact impact of climate change on hurricanes was still unclear, but that it was time for the insurance and reinsurance industries to play a larger role in government planning.She highlighted one product known as parametric insurance, which pays claims based on measurable benchmarks that are reached during extreme weather, such as central pressure during a hurricane. Governments have purchased the insurance in disaster-prone areas like coastal Mexico and the Caribbean, she said, and claims are paid more rapidly than under traditional policies.And since the claims are not based on loss assessments, policy holders also have greater discretion in how to use the funds, she said.\"There's no question that rebuilding the New Jersey coast is going be a joint effort between the government, the private sector and academia,\" Linkin said, calling for state and local officials to take a harder look at \"risk management strategies and product offerings\" from the private reinsurance industry.The business community must also be involved in any coalition tasked with rebuilding, said Ed Blakely, former executive director of New Orleans' Office of Recovery and Development Administration. He said, \"I bet for some firms in New Jersey, Kansas City is looking good now,\" but that state officials can tackle that issue by ensuring that economic development is a key focus in its renewal effort.\"In a global economy, firms can go anywhere they want,\" Blakely said, recalling the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \"We discovered this in New Orleans, that many firms that seemed to be permanent suddenly located elsewhere.\""

        "webpage": "Wall Street survives one storm but now faces another\nRoy C Smith\n12 November 2012,\nNow that Wall Street's huge bet on presidential candidate Mitt Romney has failed, banks face four more years of a less than sympathetic ear in the Oval Office. Blackout: the skyline of lower Manhattan mostly in darkness except for the Goldman Sachs building after a power outage caused by Hurricane Sandy The world's major capital market banks are in bad shape. They are trading well below book value, were recently downgraded and the majority of them have failed for more than two years to earn a return on equity greater than its cost.\nSeven of the top 10 banks have had chief executive changes since 2009, three of these being made \"effective immediately\".\nAnd the hallowed big-bank business model is broken: witness the abandonment by Swiss giant UBS of its global trading business which will eliminate 10,000 jobs over the next three years.\nCapital market banks face three especially tough issues that will shape their future during the next presidential term.\nThe cost of federal aid to the disaster areas and the plight of millions hit by Hurricane Sandy will complicate the issue but make it especially hard for the Republicans to be heartless.\nBarack Obama's re-election suggests that compromises acceptable to him will have to be made by House Republicans but no doubt they will still make it a cliffhanger. Perhaps a balance can be found by eliminating some further tax deductions for the wealthy. But balancing the budget is likely to have to wait until economic recovery is achieved.\nStuck at the bottom of the cycle\nWall Street badly needs recovery in transactional activity in capital markets. New issues have been weak in equities, derivatives and mergers, but especially so in sovereign debt and mortgage-backed securities. Many market participants, both issuers and investors, have been sitting still for years waiting for uncertainty to be removed in tax, energy, healthcare and other areas.\nPresident Obama is likely to refresh his economic team and appoint a new Treasury Secretary with some speed. Jacob Lew, Obama's chief of staff and former chief operating officer at Citigroup Alternative Investments, is the early favourite. The old team had run out of ideas, and perhaps was too focused on income inequality to do much to remove business bottlenecks. There is little indication, however, that much will change with these new appointments and the bottlenecks will remain; a disappointment for Wall Street.\nEven so, Wall Street's usual ability to innovate has been noticeably absent. A vast array of derivative products, for example, was developed over the past decade to help traders and investors around the world manage and transfer risk. In the 1980s, mortgage-backed bonds and interest-rate swaps were developed to help savings and loan organisations through the systemic crisis they then faced.\nToday, capital has to be returned to the mortgage industry, risk has to be transferred away from systemically important banks, pension funds everywhere need overhauling, and federal and state debt needs to be restructured. But Wall Street, burdened by its own troubles, hasn't come up with much in the way of solutions. It is not helping itself.\nStructural and reputational issues\nPowerful government regulatory actions such as Dodd-Frank, Vickers' banking reforms in the UK and the \"Swiss finish\" on capital requirements, together with Basel III and widespread downgrades by rating agencies will severely affect systemically important firms.\nThis will require several to make major adjustments to their business models. Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Barclays have already begun to adjust theirs under new, post-crisis leaderships. The industry that gorged itself on trading profits for a decade has already been thrown on a crash diet.\nRisk-weighted assets have been cut back, sometimes substantially, along with thousands of traders and support personnel that went with them.\nMost of the laid-off traders will try to resurface in hedge funds or other \"shadow banks\", but many of these are suffering performance problems and may not have much room.\nLooking ahead, banks must deal with the important details of the Volcker Rule, derivatives trading and other of the many Dodd-Frank rules that still have not been implemented.\nWall Street also must continue to struggle with massive reputational damage, which has been both aggravated and kept alive by an endless stream of litigation (often requiring expensive settlements) that has greatly limited its influence with clients, regulators and investors, and impaired its ability to return to \"normal\", something it greatly desires.\nObama may in time disband the task force he created at the justice department charged with \"bringing those responsible for the financial crisis to justice\", but there seems to be no hurry. In any case, the litigation fever has spread well beyond the federal realm to other agencies, regulators and state officials.\nAll in all, there is still a great deal for bankers to worry about. But just as great devastating natural disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy, often bring a shared spirit of unified effort to do the right thing, so Wall Street's long history of surviving both natural and man-made storms should see it through.\n-- Roy C Smith is a finance professor at NYU Stern School of Business"

        "webpage": "Americans Win Economics Nobel For Interpreting Stock Prices By Bill Chappell\nOct 14, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Three American professors have won the 2013 Nobel Prize for Economics for their work in identifying long-term trends in the prices of stocks and bonds, based in part on analyzing the role of risk. Professors Robert J. Shiller of Yale University and Eugene F. Fama and Lars Peter Hansen, both of the University of Chicago, won \"for their empirical analysis of asset prices,\" the Royal Swedish Academy said in announcing the honor Monday. \"The Laureates have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices,\" the academy said. \"It relies in part on fluctuations in risk and risk attitudes, and in part on behavioral biases and market frictions.\" The economists' research spans decades, stretching back to the 1960s. They pursued their theories independent of one another, laying the groundwork for the rise of index funds and \"behavioral finance,\" which takes investors' motivations and limitations into account. Here's how the academy summarized their contributions: \"Eugene Fama and several collaborators demonstrated that stock prices are extremely difficult to predict in the short run, and that new information is very quickly incorporated into prices. These findings not only had a profound impact on subsequent research but also changed market practice. The emergence of so-called index funds in stock markets all over the world is a prominent example.\" \"Lars Peter Hansen developed a statistical method that is particularly well suited to testing rational theories of asset pricing. Using this method, Hansen and other researchers have found that modifications of these theories go a long way toward explaining asset prices.\" \"Robert Shiller ...found that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends, and that the ratio of prices to dividends tends to fall when it is high, and to increase when it is low. This pattern holds not only for stocks, but also for bonds and other assets.\" Fama, 74, began his work in the mid-1960s; as Bloomberg notes, he is often called the \"father of modern finance.\" In an interview with the academy conducted minutes after the phone call informing him of his win, Fama explained that he might not have embarked on his legendary career, if he hadn't lost his passion for studying French. \"In my junior year in college, I was getting kind of tired of French. So, I took an economics course, and I loved it,\" he said. \"The rest of my two years in college I spent in economics.\" In winning the Nobel, they will split a cash award of 8 million Swedish kroner, a bit more than $1.2 million.Copyright 2013 NPR.

        "webpage": "Unreal Options\n\nView more from the\n\nIt's a nice theory: In an uncertain world, investments in business projects create options for future action that have value just as financial options do. This simple analogy underlies a growing movement in strategy and finance that encourages companies to evaluate projects based not just on analyses of their likely future cash flows but on assessments of their real-options value. Investments that appear overly risky from a purely financial view, the argument goes, may be viable once you take into account the opportunities for future action they provide.\n\nBut there's a problem with the theory, as any working manager would recognize. To gain adequate returns on a portfolio of options, whether financial or real, the portfolio has to be managed with rigorous rationality. As soon as an option no longer promises to provide future value, it must be abandoned. As Columbia Business School professor Rita Gunther McGrath put it in a 1999 article in the Academy of Management Review, \"Options must be extinguished ruthlessly when they no longer promise high upside potential.\" Yet business projects are not purely financial instruments that are coldly traded on open markets. They are, instead, complex organizational constructs that, once initiated, tend to take on lives of their own and become notoriously difficult to kill.\n\nThe tendency of companies to allow unpromising projects to drag on far too long is underscored in research by Isabelle Royer, a professor at the Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine. She studied major product-development initiatives launched by two French companies, eyeglass maker Essilor and building materials producer Lafarge. Both companies continued to invest in the projects for many years after it became clear that they had little market potential.\n\nRoyer shows how members of project teams become imbued with a collective belief that their project will succeed, a conviction that over-whelms any individual skepticism. Ultimately, the team members enter into a state of \"cognitive blindness,\" as Royer puts it, actively ignoring signs that their efforts are doomed.\n\nA similar social dynamic was revealed in a recent experiment conducted by Russell W. Coff and Michael Sacks of Emory University's Goizueta Business School in Atlanta and Kevin J. Laverty from the University of Washington at Bothell, which showed that so-called social capital can distort funding decisions. The professors had business students make decisions about allocating additional funds to three hypothetical projects. From a purely rational real-options perspective, the decision should have been clear-cut: One of the projects offered higher returns than the other two. Yet the professors found that the more personal contact a decision maker had with a particular project's proponent, the more likely he was to invest in it, even though it clearly did not warrant funding at the expense of the more-promising project. Although the researchers note that these findings are preliminary, they conclude that \"social ties may encourage managers to escalate by investing further...in ill-fated projects\" and they warn that \"real options could lead to lower performance\" if managers are encouraged to launch a flurry of projects on the assumption that they will be easy to kill down the road.\n\nSo when you make a funding decision, should you take into account an investment's role in keeping your future options open? Of course. You shouldn't foreclose a big opportunity by failing to make a modest additional outlay. But, on the other hand, you shouldn't get carried away by the options analogy - it has serious flaws. Don't make unreal assumptions about your real options.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the December 2002 issue of Harvard Business Review.\n\nNicholas G. Carr is HBR's editor-at-large.

        "webpage": "Share  Let the 'millionaires tax' die\nBy Micah Z. Kellner View author archive\nCuomo: Holding line on tax hikes. At the height of the fiscal crisis two years ago, staring down the barrel of a $20 billion budget gap, the state imposed an income-tax surcharge on New Yorkers earning more than $200,000 a year  -  and called it a \"millionaire's tax.\" I voted for it as a temporary solution, expecting that the economy would have turned the corner by now. But a tax isn't temporary if we keep re-authorizing it. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues want to do just that  -  arguing that we should extend the tax before it expires this year. If the surcharge were truly a millionaire's tax, maybe it would be worth discussing. But since when do hard-working two-income middle-class families count as millionaires? And the surcharge hasn't even raised the revenue it was supposed to  -  falling well short of the projected $4 billion a year. In the middle of a fragile recovery, with the state's current deficit still at a whopping $10 billion and growing, we can't be held hostage to improvising our way out of budget trouble (whether with taxes, cuts and/or borrowing) year after year. We have to recognize that we must fundamentally transform the very way New York state's government is structured. This is not the time to tinker around the edges. We don't need higher taxes  -  we need smarter spending. And we should get beyond arguing about service cuts and instead find ways to provide services more efficiently. Gov. Cuomo is leading the way. He's putting forward innovative ideas, like a spending and government-efficiency commission to reorganize the state's government  -  weeding out layers of unnecessary bureaucracy that clog up Albany. He has proposed a Medicaid redesign team to reign in New York's out-of-control Medicaid costs  -  providing better service for less money  -  and another team that will do away with costly and unnecessary state mandates. We in the Legislature must be a partner with the governor to redesign and rebuild New York's government from the ground up  -  and there are plenty more great ideas that we can build on. For instance, New York is one of only six states that pays for Medicare Part B premiums for government retirees. By asking retirees to cover these payments  -  which amount to $110 a month, about the cost of a cable bill  -  New York's taxpayers can save more than $100 million every year. We can also reform our state's health-insurance-coverage system for future retirees, so that it rewards those state workers who have put in the most years of service  -  saving tens of millions of dollars more. And then there's the $300 million in revenue the state could raise by repealing the Prohibition-era law that prevents grocery stores from selling wine  -  a move that would create thousands of jobs, all without raising taxes. By making government smarter and more efficient, we'll create jobs and foster investment in New York again. But extending the income-tax surcharge would be a colossal, job-killing step backward. It would punish middle-class New Yorkers and small businesspeople just when we should be focusing on promoting growth. The economy is on the mend, and a new day is dawning in Albany. As Gov. Cuomo said, we can build New York back bigger and stronger than before. That means embracing innovative ideas. In this era of new promise, the income-tax surcharge isn't innovative, and it just isn't the answer. Micah Z. Kellner represents the Upper East Side, Yorkville and Roosevelt Island in the state As sembly.\nThe rush to... The rush to blame The rush to blame Share Selection"

More than 98 percent of registered voters defied intimidation to cast their ballots in an orderly and peaceful manner, voting overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia. The discipline, patience, and dignity displayed on that day will continue to be a hallmark of East Timor after it has completed its transition to full independence. In our long struggle for independence, we have had to face hard and sometimes painful choices. In order to establish a sound macroeconomic framework for our new country, more hard choices will need to be made. Again, the world will see East Timor unflinchingly choose to do not what is expedient for the moment but what is right for the future development of the nation.\nAlready the majority East Timorese Cabinet of the United Nations Transitional Administration has endorsed policies establishing a framework for macroeconomic stability. Measures to increase revenue by instituting a fair taxation regime and reducing the inflated civil service that was a legacy of the previous administration have demonstrated our adherence to principles of prudent fiscal management. The U.S. dollar has been adopted as the official currency for the transition period.\nThese principles will be further advanced after the transition, as East Timor demonstrates its commitment to sustainability in building a sound fiscal framework underpinned by a stable, credible currency. Any future moves to establish a national currency will include efforts to ensure it has strong financial backing and the credibility necessary to be welcomed by international financial markets.\nAn independent East Timor will have a lean, cost-effective government that will seek to keep aggregate expenditures aligned with the economy's absorptive capacity. Domestic revenue sources are expected to provide a solid foundation for financing the country's recurrent budget without recourse to donor assistance. Already, despite the massive devastation of its infrastructure and disrupted trade systems that East Timor has had to cope with, it is well on the way to exceeding the $17 million in revenues projected for the current fiscal year.\nFor the medium term, projected oil and gas exports from the Timor Gap (the expanse of ocean between northern Australia and the island of Timor) are highly promising, and this export income may be supplemented by earnings from other successful oil and gas exploration and the resulting concessions, as well as from exports of marble and other hard-rock minerals. East Timor has been judicious in its allocation of Timor Gap receipts. Similarly, it should be feasible for East Timor to invest any windfalls from energy exports in, for example, an endowment fund. Such a fund could act as a stabilizing force, safeguarding income from resource sales that rightly belongs not only to East Timorese citizens of today but also to their children and grandchildren.\nThree-fourths of our population is engaged in agriculture. Traditionally, these farmers have employed a risk-minimizing strategy to reduce their vulnerability to economic shocks rather than a riskier, income-maximizing strategy. A posttransition East Timor will strengthen traditional agriculture by using low-technology inputs to increase crop yields. Providing access to rural banking and microcredit facilities will increase this sector's output growth and improve its ability to market surpluses and build linkages to the private sector. Achieving sustained economic growth will be essential to rural development in East Timor.\nGiven the country's overwhelmingly young population, attaining sustained growth will be crucial. To reach this goal, East Timor will do all that is necessary to enable the private sector to thrive. An independent East Timor will encourage private sector development. East Timor's beautiful tropical climate will be matched by an equally attractive investment climate, with appropriate laws protecting property rights and contracts, establishing a fair commercial code, codifying labor relations, and minimizing the costs of doing business. From previous administrations, we have already learned much about market-distorting practices, such as collusion, corruption, and nepotism. We have repeatedly declared our commitment to seeing this legacy eradicated.\nA posttransition East Timor will welcome sound investments by firms that wish to operate in an environment free of artificial barriers to trade. We expect that all stakeholders in our society will embrace the values that have guided the East Timorese liberation struggle for the past twenty-five years: transparency, mutual respect, and equality of treatment. In an independent East Timor, financial rewards will not depend on race, religion, or political party membership, or on whom you know or where you live but rather on individual initiative and hard work.\nJos\u00e9 Ramos Horta is Cabinet Member for Foreign Affairs in the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor. In recognition of his many years as a leader of East Timor's independence movement, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with East Timorese Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, in 1996.\nEmilia Pires is Head of the National Planning and Development Agency in the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor."

        "webpage": "Americans Choose Gold as the Best Long-Term Investment\nby Dennis Jacobe, Chief Economist\nMen, seniors, middle-income Americans, and Republicans are more enamored with gold\nPRINCETON, NJ -- Thirty-four percent of Americans say gold is the best long-term investment, more than say so about four other types of investments. Real estate (19%) and stocks (17%) are distant second choices.\nThe Aug. 11-14 Gallup poll was conducted at the end of a tumultuous week on Wall Street that sent the price of gold soaring.\nGallup asked a similar question from 2002 to 2010, but that question did not include gold. Real estate, savings accounts, and stocks jockeyed for the top spot during that time. Americans' faith in real estate and stocks suffered amid the 2008 economic crisis, but rebounded somewhat in 2010.\nGold is Americans' top pick as the best long-term investment regardless of gender, age, income, or party ID, but men, seniors, middle-income Americans, and Republicans are more enamored with it than are other Americans.\nWomen and upper-income Americans are more likely than others in their subgroups to point to real estate as the best long-term investment. After gold, low-income Americans are most likely to pick savings accounts as the best option for long-term investing.\nTraditionally, gold -- like the U.S. dollar -- has been a safe haven in times of economic and political turmoil. It is a globally accepted store of value and one of the most highly desired precious metals.\nThe demand for gold has soared in recent years, as the financial crisis engulfed the global banking industry. More recently, the efforts of nations around the world and their monetary authorities to stimulate the global economy and avoid a repeat of the 1930s have made gold even more attractive. Current sovereign debt problems have only added to the demand for gold.\nGold has always had limited industrial uses, but great value in jewelry and as a precious metal. Now, the proliferation and basic devaluation of paper currencies has people on Wall Street talking about gold as a currency and pricing it accordingly -- something approaching a market-established gold standard that relates paper currency to an amount of gold.\nThat one in three Americans see gold as the best long-term investment may indicate a bubble in the value of this precious metal -- something that may be corroborated if gold continues to plunge as it did Wednesday. At the same time, this sentiment among many Americans may be related to the growing lack of confidence in the U.S. economy. This is particularly the case among upper-income Americans, who are now more pessimistic about the direction of the economy than their middle- and lower-income counterparts. The last time this happened was during the financial crisis of late 2008 and early 2009.\nResults for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted Aug. 11-14, 2011, with a random sample of 1,008 adults, aged 18 and older, living in the continental U.S. selected using random digit dial sampling.\nFor results based on the total sample of national adults, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is \u00b14 percentage points.\nInterviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones and cellular phones, with interviews conducted in Spanish for respondents who are primarily Spanish-speaking. Each sample includes a minimum quota of 400 cell phone respondents and 600 landline respondents per 1,000 national adults, with additional minimum quotas among landline respondents by region. Landline telephone numbers are chosen at random among listed telephone numbers. Cell phone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods. Landline respondents are chosen at random within each household on the basis of which member had the most recent birthday.\nSamples are weighted by gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, adults in the household, and phone status (cell phone only/landline only/both, cell phone mostly, and having an unlisted landline number). Demographic weighting targets are based on the March 2010 Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older non-institutionalized population living in U.S. telephone households. All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting and sample design.\nIn addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.\nView methodology, full question results, and trend data.\nFor more details on Gallup's polling methodology, visit .\nUSA All Gallup Headlines Business Economy Stocks Northern America\nLack of Retirement Funds Is Americans' Biggest Financial Worry\nHealthcare Costs Key to When and Where U.S. Investors Retire\nU.S. Investor Optimism Declines in May\nIn U.S., 54% Have Stock Market Investments, Lowest Since 1999\nThe Best Business Articles of 2015 on Jobs and the Economy\nIs the official U.S. unemployment rate a \"big lie\"?

        "webpage": "Lawmakers look to fix tax code quirk March 13, 2013 By\nJim Baron LINCOLN - Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Rep. David Cicilline are teaming up to reverse what they say is a perverse incentive in the U.S. Tax Code that provides a tax break to companies that move American jobs to other countries.\nA bill they call the Offshoring Prevention Act, which Whitehouse introduced in the Senate on Monday and Cicilline introduced in the House of Representatives Tuesday would require business to pay taxes on their overseas operations the same way they would if that work were being done in the United States. Cicilline was at Lincoln's Tanury Industries Monday to announce the legislation. Whitehouse was scheduled to be there as well, but Cicilline said his colleague injured his back and could not make it.\nTanury is a company that would benefit from the bill if it became law. Currently, the lawmakers say, U.S. companies that manufacture goods abroad for sale here at home are allowed to defer payment of federal income tax - waiting to pay taxes on foreign income in years that minimize their tax liability. They say their legislation would \"correct the tax code\" and allow manufacturers operating in the U.S. to compete on a level playing field.\n\"It eliminates benefits that currently are provided to companies that ship American jobs overseas,\" Cicilline told a handful of Tanury employees brought to the cafeteria to hear about the legislation. \"Under our tax code, they actually get a tax benefit if they take American jobs and ship them overseas; what this legislation does is it undoes that and will create incentives to keep manufacturing jobs here in the United States. \"The big multinational corporations doing manufacturing outside the United States, they like the current policy, they can avoid paying taxes on operations outside the United States which enhances their profits; it just costs the United States manufacturing jobs,\" the 1st District congressman said. Tanury President and CEO Michael Akkaoui said the company has all of its operations within the United States and it services more than 1,000 U.S. based companies.Akkaoui , boasted that Tanury didn't lay off a single employee during the recession of the last several years and in fact it added 10 high-paying jobs over that period. \"Tanury Industries is an example of a company that has done it right, Akkaoui said. \"We compete on quality, technology and service. Legislation such as this is critical to maintaining our position in the global economy,\"Cicilline told The Times that taking away the tax break, \"further incentivizes companies to keep and grow jobs here in America and, obviously, here in Rhode Island\"George Carvalho, a Whitehouse aide, said the additional taxes the bill would collect would reduce the deficit by an estimated $19.5 billion over a 10-year period.\"It should be an issue on which we can build bi-partisan support,\" Cicilline said, \"It's common sense, it's good for our country, it's good for Rhode Island and it's good districts all over. I think, fundamentally, people understand that if we don't start making things again in this country and start manufacturing and selling American-made goods all over the world, we are never going to really rebuild the economy of this country.\" Cicilline pointed out that manufacturing jobs tend to pay better than non-manufacturing jobs, \"so these are jobs with good wages.\"In a written statement, Whitehouse said, \"I have heard from too many Rhode Island small businesses that are fed up with unfair competition from abroad. By giving special tax deals to companies that ship jobs overseas, we put local small businesses at a disadvantage. Ending this costly tax giveaway will help keep jobs in America and generate nearly $20 billion in new revenue - a true win-win.\"Whitehouse first submitted the legislation in 2011."

According to the Urban Institute , in 2011, 39.6% of American families were living below 200% of the federal poverty level. \"Many of these families struggle daily to make ends meet, even if they work,\" says the Institute in a recent report.\nMore Headlines The Psychology Behind Why We Love Black Friday\nHow Do the GOP Presidential Candidates Stack Up on Student Loans?\nObamacare to Get More Expensive in 2016\nObama Could Lop Hundreds Off Your Monthly Mortgage Payment\nHow To Handle Your Newfound Home Equity\nThat's disturbing news, and 2013 has started out on shaky ground with a fourth-quarter gross domestic product report showing the U.S. economy experiencing negative growth (although most economists say that should be temporary.)\nIf there is a silver lining, it may come from an unlikely source: the Internal Revenue Service.\nAccording to Capital One Financial (COF) , there are some opportunities to save more money on taxes for low- and middle-class families -- you just have to know where to look.\n\"Tax season is a good opportunity to plan for the future, especially if you anticipate receiving a refund,\" says Mariadele Priest, director of community development banking at Capital One Bank. \"When individuals learn how to save, budget, pay down their debts and build their assets, they can become more financially secure and direct more money back into the local economy.\"\nThat's where taxes -- more specifically, the lack of them -- can make a difference. \"Being thorough in the tax preparation process is critical to ensuring low-to-middle income families can take advantage of important credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, that can jump-start a long-term savings plan,\" she says.\nPriest says low- and middle-income taxpayers should focus on these three areas to save money and improve their overall personal financial situation:\nEarned Income Tax Credit: The EITC is worth a maximum of $6,044, and many who qualify aren't claiming it, Priest says. \"In fact, one in five people who could claim the credit don't because they do not know about it or because they don't file their taxes,\" Priest says. Taxpayers in 22 states may also qualify for a state or local EITC tax break. Check with your tax preparer. Free tax preparation and filing: Capital One says it's helping pay for free tax prep for low-income families and small-business entrepreneurs around the nation. If you make less than $57,000 annually, there are already 15 tax preparation services that allow you to file for free. And you can also file for free, no matter what your income level, at at the IRS' website . Tax-advantaged retirement savings: Priest advises using tax refunds to \"jump-start\" a savings plan. Maxing out on an individual retirement account contribution can make a huge difference in your financial future, Priest says. \"You have until the very last day to contribute and deduct the amount from your taxable income,\" she explains. The contribution limit for 2012 is $5,000 if you're 49 or younger and $6,000 if you're 50 or older. 12"

It is generally viewed by investors as insignificant, since the amount of money involved is relatively small, equal to about 1% of eurozone economic output.\nDespite the renewed focus on growth, expectations are low that leaders will arrive at a solution for the immediate crisis in the eurozone.\nItaly has proposed using bailout funds to purchase government bonds. The goal is to ease borrowing costs for nations that are undertaking economic reforms, such as Italy and Spain. However, the move could come with conditions that those nations have so far been reluctant to accept.\nThe main details of the broader EU growth pact were hammered out last week by the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Spain -- the four largest euro-area economies.\nThe centerpiece of the pact is a \u20ac10 billion increase in the funds of the European Investment Bank, which will raise its ability to lend by \u20ac60 billion, according to Van Rompuy.\nThe leaders have also agreed to the reallocation of \u20ac60 billion in unused structural funds to subsidize small businesses and reduce youth unemployment. They also backed a \u20ac10 billion program to test \"project bonds,\" which will be used to fund investments in energy, transportation and broadband across Europe.\nThe move signals a shift away from the austerity measures that Germany, in particular, had prescribed in response to the debt crisis in the eurozone. Economic activity in Europe has slowed this year, with 11 countries judged to be in recession. The latest data point to continued deterioration in the current quarter.\nThe leaders are also discussing steps toward deeper integration, with the hopes of clarifying a path forward for the economic and monetary union.\nOfficially, the leaders will discuss \"building blocks\" to address the long-term challenges facing the euro-area economy, according to a paper by Van Rompuy and other top euro-area officials, including European Central Bank president Mario Draghi.\nHowever, they are not expected make much progress on controversial plans to merge the liabilities of euro-area governments by issuing a common form of debt, such as Eurobonds or Eurobills.\nGermany, the euro-area's largest economy, remains opposed to assuming the debts of other nations without a stronger political union to ensure that fiscal discipline is enforced."

        "webpage": "Trading stock can be performed in a variety of ways. One way to trade stock is to hire a broker who will perform the transactions on the client's behalf. Another manner to trade stock is to open an on-line account and trade stock using an on-line program found on the Internet. A third way is to purchase a computer program that permits the user to trade stock through use of a brokerage service. These examples are just three ways stock can be traded.\nAfter a stock is purchased, the owner of the shares of stock usually desires to monitor the value of the shares. This is done in an effort to both avoid a significant loss financially should the value of the stock decrease and to increase profit should the value of the stock increase. In either case, once the stock is purchased, it is important to know how the value of it fluctuates, if at all.\nWhen trading long, a stock's value decreases, many owners of the stock desire to sell their shares in order to avoid losing more money in the event that the stock's value continues to decline further. Once the stock is sold, either through a broker or through a computer program, the transaction is generally over. This means that if shares of stock are sold and then soon thereafter the stock's value increases to an amount where the individual may have wanted to repurchase the shares, the individual must instruct the computer program or broker to purchase a specific number of shares. Put another way, when the stock's value rises, the computer program or broker generally will not automatically repurchase shares that were previously sold. Thus, separate steps are required, both of which must be initiated by the individual. As a result, the individual could not only lose money by selling the shares of stock at a loss, but he could also fail to make money because he did not repurchase the stock when the stock's value began to increase past his previously sold price.\nWhen purchasing stock through the use of a computer, when the user wishes to buy a stock, he or she generally instructs the program being used to buy the stock. The price at which the user is willing to purchase the shares of stock is referred to as the ask price. Then, if the user wishes to sell the stock he can do so, again by instructing the computer to do so. These buying and selling transactions are generally performed as two separate transactions, and the user must initiate both. There are at least three different methods to trade stock long, short, or both. Trading long occurs when an individual owns shares of stock and sells them later when the per share value has increased in price in order to generate a profit. An investor who sells stock short borrows shares from a brokerage house and sells them to another buyer. Proceeds from the sale go into the shorter's account. He must buy those shares back (cover) at some point in time and return them to the lender. When an individual sells short, he is anticipating that the value per share of stock is going to decrease which would result in his being able to earn a profit when he repurchases the shares and \"returns\" them to the rightful owner.\nWhen trading long, a user can instruct a computer program of the current art to sell stock when the stock's value reaches a certain desirable amount. The value of a stock at any given moment is known as the bid price. However, once the stock is sold, the program no longer monitors the value of the stock that was just sold. As a result, if the stock was sold and declined in value, the user limited his loss by selling the stock. If however, the stock's value increased at least back to the price at which it was sold, the user essentially lost money because he could have repurchased the stock as soon as the stock's value equaled the price at which it was previous sold. Similar considerations apply when stock is traded short.\nThus, there is the need for a computer program that continuously monitors the value per share of stock after shares are sold and then automatically repurchases the shares when the value of the shares just sold reaches a specified amount. In other words, there is a need for a dynamic program for trading stock."

        "webpage": "Republicans Dominate Medicare Discussions On White House Fiscal Commission\nNewscom / Pete Souza\nByBrian BeutlerPublishedSeptember 9, 2010, 2:40 PM EDT\nThe White House's fiscal commission has become a target for progressive activists in large part because a number of reports and public statements indicate that the panel will recommend benefit cuts to Social Security. Most of the backlash has come from critics calling on the commission's co-chair, Republican Alan Simpson, to resign over controversial public statements he's made about the popular program.But the commissioners are also grappling with another sensitive entitlement program: Medicare. For a number of reasons, the commission is farther from consensus on Medicare than it is on Social Security: Medicare is a more unwieldy program; the commissioners differ wildly on how to prevent its soaring costs from bankrupting the government; and members have already had a working group meeting dedicated to Social Security in isolation. But the ideological conservatism of the Republicans on the commission -- and, indeed, of the commission as a whole -- combined with Democratic fatigue over health care reform mean that the center of gravity of discussions is tilted to the right.\n\"[B]asically you've got some Dems saying they don't want to jump back in the [health care reform] pool, so you've mainly got Republicans swimming in there on their own,\" says one source familiar with the commission's proceedings.\n\"[Senate Finance Committee Chair Max] Baucus has kind of come in and basically said, 'we've just done health care,'\" a second source tells TPM. The sentiment echoes that of other Democratic commissioners. \"We've done health care, we can't do much more.\"\nThat leaves rigid conservatives like David Camp and Paul Ryan -- the GOP's top budget guy and author of a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program -- at the top of the rhetorical heap. As a result, according to the second source, the commission's focus reflects their priorities much more than progressive ones. \"There have been some discussions about cost-sharing. There have been some discussions about Medi-gap policies,\" the source says. At a staff level, this source says, the feeling is that \"there needs to be more skin in the game and people need to pay more...the whole argument that people don't understand how much health care costs and are wasteful.\" \"A lot of discussion on the commission has been that people need to get better price signals and be smarter shoppers,\" the second source said. \"And that is very, very worrisome.\"\n\"The solutions that you come up with on health care are determined by what you identify as the problem,\" the source said. \"If you think the consumers are the problem, then you're going to come up with a set of answers that include vouchers and higher cost sharing and that's a problem. If you believe that the problem is the system, then you look at systemic issues.... If you believe that the only thing you really care about is federal spending, then come up with proposals that shift costs on to businesses and individuals and maybe local governments.\"\nThe news isn't all bad, however. For instance, progressives on the commission have put forth suggestions -- to including ones to lower the price of prescription drugs and create a public health insurance option -- that are on a long list of policy proposals (including conservative ones) that staffers will soon pare down.\nIt's also perfectly possible that the commission will only be able to reach a partial consensus, and if that happens, their recommendations might not touch on Medicare at all.\n\"There has not been a lot of discussion about what happens -- do you have to have an agreement on everything?\" the second source said. \"If you can reach an agreement on one thing it sets up the dynamic where you can reach an agreement on other things.\"\nThe commission's mandatory spending working group will get down to brass tacks on Medicare when they meet again next week.\nFollow @brianbeutler\nBrian Beutler is TPM's senior congressional reporter.

But go down to the movement's headquarters, as I did this past weekend, and you see something far different.\nIt's not just that knowledge of their \"oppressors\"  -  the evil bankers  -  is pretty thin, or that many of them are clearly college kids with nothing better to do than embrace the radical chic of \"a cause.\" I found a unifying and increasingly coherent ideology emerging among the protesters, which at its core has less to do with the evils of the banking business and more about the evils of capitalism  -  and the need for a socialist revolution.\nGasparino goes on to detail what he found and it's as unremarkable and as expected a listing of what you'd find at any A.N.S.W.E.R. protest. You know it is radical when even Richard Trumka is vilified:\nThat was pretty mild compared to the sentiments offered in the official \"Statement of the League for the Revolutionary Party\" on the protests. These guys view as the enemy not just Wall Street tycoons, but also liberal labor leaders like Richard Trumka of the AFL-CIO.\nThe problem with Trumka, according to the Revolutionary Party and its Zuccotti Park contingent: He wants to work with wishy-washy Democratic Party politicians, where the true revolutionaries want to \"defend and develop Marxist theory as a guide to action,\" which is the protests' real purpose.\nAnd yet Trumka is one of many Democrats who at least tentatively embraces this mob. Political expediency. They want to use this to validate their class warfare campaign.\nYes friends, the murderous Che is again plastered on everything and the \"revolutionary\" Marxist spirit permeates everything - which is why this is eventually destined to implode:\nMaybe the worse-spent dollar I have ever spent in my life was on a propaganda broadsheet titled \"Justice,\" which advocates \"Struggle, Solidarity, Socialism.\" On the front page of the newspaper-like document, beneath the headline \"Capitalism: System Failure,\" was a tease for a story on the economy and how \"influential business economist Nouriel Roubini\" recently said how \"Karl Marx had it right. At some point, capitalism can destroy itself.\"\nYes, the left-leaning Roubini made that fatuous statement, and many similar ones  -  so many, in fact, that he has lost much of his credibility in financial circles, though that didn't quite make it into the \"Marx Was Right!\" story.\nAlso absent was any notice of how the much-hated banks benefited not from free-market capitalism, which would have let them fail in 2008, but from crony capitalism that bailed them out. The similar cronyism practiced by Trumka and the Obama administration  -  massive spending on useless but politically connected businesses like Solyndra, paired with class-warfare rhetoric  -  likewise has very little to do with free markets.\nYeah, this ain't the '60s kids. And the core then was just as radical as the core of OWS is now. When the war in Vietnam ended, so did the ability of the radicals to get their anti-capitalist message out. Eventually this will be seen by the populace as a whole for what it really is. That's because at some point, the true nature of that core that Gasparino talks about will shine through in such a way that even slick spin doctors won't be able to credibly deny it. And when that happens, the entire movement will collapse like a wet paper box.\nPosted in Bruce McQuain, Culture, The Left | Tagged Charles Gasparino, Marxism, NY Post, OWS Contact Us"

        "webpage": "Nickel and Dimed: Scrubbing in Maine\nby Trent Hamm This week, The Simple Dollar is conducting a detailed review of Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed. This title is a bit of an unusual choice for a review of personal finance books, as it details an educated and affluent woman's attempt to get by while working at low-income jobs. Can we learn anything from this noble experiment? Let's find out.\nIn the second portion of Nickel and Dimed, Barbara takes a job in Maine as a maid, cleaning the homes of the affluent as an employee of a home cleaning service. The job is labor-intensive, doesn't pay well, and is fraught with potential injury issues, but the job holds even more disconcerting elements.\nThe first red flag raised is the inherent distrust of the working class by the affluent. Many of the people who hire cleaning services are clearly distrustful and disdainful of the workers that actually provide this service to them. They leave obvious \"traps\" (such as money sitting out with video cameras trained on it) in order to catch dishonest employees and leave borderline crazy instructions for cleaning their property, but even when the workers show themselves up to the challenge by being honest and forthright in their duties, the homeowners still treat them with great disdain. This merely causes the workers to do nothing more than resent the affluent, which does little more than cause the workers to do suboptimal work in the house because of the way they were treated.\nThis begs the question: how should people treat service industry workers? I tend to tip well if a strong service is provided to me in a restaurant and I often show additional gratitude when other service providers (such as secretaries, janitors, and so forth) perform what I need them to with speed, quality, and accuracy. A simple show of appreciation goes a long way in cementing a strong relationship with people who provide services for you. For example, at my previous job I used to give the janitor a birthday gift and would (every once in a while) bring a leftover meal from home and give to him. In return, my office was impeccably cleaned almost every evening and the bathroom on my floor was always pristine, while other offices and restrooms were perfunctorily cleaned at best. The simple fact is that tipping and respect of service workers pays dividends.\nAnother aspect of this general problem is \"injury of the spirit;\" in other words, when the reward to excel is minimal, why bother trying to excel? One could argue that the feeling you get from a well-completed task is reward enough, but how does that apply to an individual making less than a liveable wage? For that matter, how does that really apply to anyone? The maids in this chapter are instructed to simply \"make it look good,\" and there is absolutely no incentive to them to do anything more than that, even though they realize that, for example, scrubbing floors with only a tiny bit of water doesn't actually clean the floor.\nThe lesson of this section is that you should reward service workers when they provide a regular service for you. If you have a home cleaner, leave that person a tip or a gift once in a while; if a secretary at work constantly solves your problems, leave a flower (or a similar gift) and a card for them. The service industry is often underpaid for the work they do, and showing them that you appreciate and value their work can do nothing but make your own life easier and better.\nTomorrow, I'll address the final section of the book, which revolves around Barbara's work at chain retailers in Minnesota.\nYou can jump quickly to the other parts of this review of Nickel and Dimed using these links:\nServing in Florida\nScrubbing in Maine\nSelling in Minnesota\nBuy or Don't Buy?\nNickel and Dimed is the third of fifty-two books in The Simple Dollar's series 52 Personal Finance Books in 52 Weeks.\nCleaning Toronto says: October 3, 2007 at 10:48 pm This is so true. I get a lot of this as the owner of a cleaning company."

Without a revaluation, the required tightening of the money supply and interest rates would be much larger, particularly if the US dollar weakens further.Goldman Sachs yesterday was optimistic about China's interest-rate hike, saying it would be \"better late than never.\"\"The rate move is more a part of a broad switch effort toward market-based monetary policy management and away from administrative controls rather than an additional new tightening measure,\" its report said.Goldman Sachs said that it expects the Bank of China to raise rates further next year, but at a more measured pace, with cumulative tightening likely to reach between 100 and 150 basis points.In late October, China raised interest rates for the first time in nine years, lifting benchmark interest rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.58 percent for one-year lending and 2.5 percent for deposits.Meanwhile, China is approaching the right moment for reforming its fixed exchange-rate system, a leading economist was quoted as saying in the official central bank's newspaper yesterday.\"The cost of not adjusting the exchange-rate system is growing,\" said Ba Shusong (\u5df4\u66d9\u677e), deputy head of the financial institute of the National Development Research Center, in an interview with the Financial News.\"The time for reform of the exchange-rate system is now gradually maturing,\" he said.Song Guoqing (\u5b8b\u570b\u9752), a professor at the China Center for Economic Research at Peking University, said he believed the time was right for an appreciation of the currency.\"Conditions for the appreciation of the yuan are already mature,\" Song said in an interview with the 21st Century Business Herald.Song said there was no evidence to support the view that an appreciation of the yuan would result in the outflow of tens of billions of dollars as currency speculators cash in their gains.\"The investment return in China is still relatively high,\" Song said.China has been under pressure from the international community, especially major trading partners such as the US and Japan, to revalue the yuan.Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao (\u6eab\u5bb6\u5bf6) has said China would not revalue the yuan under duress.\"Honestly speaking, the more speculation there is ... the more unlikely it is that the necessary measures can be undertaken,\" Wen said."

        "webpage": "Spain's Unemployment Rate Rises to One in Four\nSpanish unemployment has risen again, this time to a level of one quarter of the workforce.Only Greece has a higher unemployment rate in the European Union. Spanish unemployment today is the highest in modern history and higher than at any time in the 36 years since the death of Francisco Franco. The current unemployment rate is more than double the average in the other nations of the eurozone.\nThis news comes when other bleak economic data from Spain shows that the plans to save Spain from economic disaster are not working. Earlier in the week, the GDP of Spain was reported to have shrunk by 0.4 percent in the last quarter, making it the fifth consecutive quarter of economic contraction in Spain.\nEbrahim Rahbari, an economic analyst for Citigroup in London, summed up the situation: \"There is a huge amount of uncertainty in Spain right now. There are question marks about the banking sector and public finances and economic fundamentals suggest we will see a bailout sooner than later.\"\nRicardo Santos, an economist at BNP Paribas in London, was quoted by Bloomberg saying: \"The situation is serious.There is still room for deterioration in unemployment. Activity is weak and the government will reduce jobs as there are strict targets to adjust the number of public sector temporary workers, especially in health and education.\"\nJustin Knight at UBS in London also viewed the new data with concern, and cautioned that more than unemployment was involved: \"Unemployment is one part of a multifaceted problem in Spain. There recession is looking very bad and it looks like it will be worse than forecast. Spain's public and private net external debt is the same size as Greece.\"\nSara Balina, an analyst in Madrid, noted: \"It's unlikely that the government's forecasts will be met next year as fiscal consolidation accelerates.... Third-quarter data were better than expected because they were distorted by a temporary increase in demand before a value-added tax increase and by exports that may suffer from weakening growth in the euro zone.\" Elwin de Groot, a market analyst in Utrecht, said: \"Contracting pressures in the economy persist. It will be very hard for the Spanish government to achieve its budget targets.\"\nThis uncertainty has affected the interest that Spain must pay on bonds simply to service existing debt. The interest on 10-year bond yield rose 6 basis points to 5.52 percent after the announcement of the latest bad news. That interest rate is 396 basis points higher than Germany has to pay on its 10-year bonds. Short term Spanish bonds were negatively affected by the news as well.\nSpanish banks are doing very poorly too. CaixaBank, which is the third largest bank in Spain, showed profits which were 42 percent lower than the previous year. Declining values of real estate in Spain were a principal reason as was the rise in bad loans, which rose from 5.58 percent to 8.43 percent. Banco Popular Espanol, another large Spanish bank, announced that its profits had fallen by 23 percent.\nThis bad news comes three months after the European Central Bank offered to buy Spanish bonds in order to keep the borrowing costs of the Spanish government as low as possible. Prime Minister Rajoy is considering asking for a eurozone bailout, and he is also considering stronger austerity measures.\nSpain is the fourth largest economy in the eurozone, after Germany, France, and Italy. So what happens in Spain matters more than what happens in a much smaller economy like Greece. This has led Spain to replace Greece, Ireland, and Portugal as the most serious threats to the survival of the euro.\nMost analysts give Spain credit for trying to get a handle on its economic problems. The government, for example, has made austerity much more important than several other troubled European nations, and the prime minister has the advantage of having a single party that has a parliamentary majority.\nOther problems, however, like the secessionist movement in Catalonia, represent politico-economic problems that nations like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal do not have. One thing is clear: The slow disintegration of the eurozone and the dreams of a United States of Europe as a panacea for the problems of the continent remain elusive. When one out of every four Spaniards who wants a job cannot find a job, there are very fundamental problems with Spain.\nSpain's current unemployment rate exceeds the US rate during the Great Depression\nSpain Forecasts 24.3% Unemployment In 2012, 1.7% GDP Contraction\nGreece's Unemployment Rate Just Got Even More Horrifying\nGreek jobless rate double that of Eurozone: Over 60% of young workers unemployed\nEurozone unemployment hits record high and reveals two-speed Europe"

        "webpage": "Lessons for Reagan from Britain's conservatives?\nThe American and British economies are so different from each other that there are definite limitations in the current game of finding lessons for the Reagan administration in the experience of the Thatcher government. A major distinction lies in Britain's nationalized industries and established \"welfare state\" institutions.Yet the temptation to draw parallels has proved irresistible to many writers, now that the United States is on the brink of a proclaimed governmental swing to the right as Britain was when Mrs. Thatcher took office a year and a half ago.\nAmerican liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith looks at the economic plight of Britain and twits his conservative colleagues on how their theories work. Conservatives reply that the problem is not in their theories but in Mrs. Thatcher's failure to execute them sufficiently.\nAt least one of those theories, monetarism, is itself challenged by a former prime minister in Mrs. Thatcher's own Conservative Party, Edward Heath. He said that this theory, by which the government has been trying to hold down growth of the money supply, had had a \"ruinous\" effect in Britain and he hoped Mr. Reagan was too intelligent to accept it.What can one make of this crossfire? What lessons, if any, are there for Mr. Reagan and his team?First, some  the high interest rates associates with monetary restraint have been hard on British business, the annual rate of growth in the money supply has not slowed to the Thatcher target of 7 to 11 percent but only to about 22.5 percent -- more than the rate of inflation. Nor have taxes or government spending been cut to the conservatives' desired degree.Mrs. Thatcher carried through on pledged pay boosts to public employees while trying to encourage wage restraint in private industry. She has had to lower goals for reduction in public sector borrowing, as nationalized industries were propped up and compensation increased to match the tide of unemployment. Indeed , recession and unemployment have grown to the point where public pools have reversed themselves to indicate greater concern over unemployment than inflation. The high interest rates have helped strengthen the pound, making needed raw materials imports cheaper but making British exports harder to sell.It all may sound like the worst of both worlds, unless one takes the second look some are offering in the light of the past few months. The rate of inflation for last year may be something like 15 percent. But an annual rate based on the last month would be less than 10 percent. The trend in real terms is in the right direction, as is the trend in interest rates and government spending. \"We see wage bargaining at a more sensible level than previously,\" says the chancellor of the exchequer.\nThe question is whether the dissatisfaction expressed with Mrs. Thatcher in the polls is outweighed by what she perceived to be the case as the new year began:\"We are absolutely on the right track, and people know and feel it.\"Despite the impatience of many, some Britons are sauing that 18 months is too short a time to expect the Thatcher approach to reach fruition. All friends of Britain will hope the prime minister is right when she declares:\"Attitudes are changing. People are becoming more competitive. Managers are beginning to manage, and the industrial base will be genuinely strong, not artificially supported.\"It is in the realm of attitudes that the fundamental fight against inflation and recession takes place. Mrs. Thatcher's own unflinching attitude, however many accomodations to necessity she has had to make, is the kind that has a chance to foster similar strength among the people.Perhaps here is a lesson for Mr. Reagan, despite the differences in the two economies. He can listen to Mrs. Thatcher when, for example, she suggests she failed to go far enough in her first attempts at budget-cutting. And he can follow her unflinching attitude by adhering to his instruction to the members of his cabinet that they must never allow reelection politics to have any effect on their best judgments for the good of the country.\nWhat made Margaret Thatcher special in her time\nMargaret Thatcher, Iron Lady, transformed Britain\nTo Republicans, Margaret Thatcher was first conservative-as-insurgent"

The entire Congress then has to pass it by Christmas Eve or face huge across-the-board spending cuts. Twenty-five years ago, another politically-divided Congress approved the biggest tax code overhaul in the nation's history. But much has changed since then. In 1986, on the south lawn of the White House one sunny morning in late October, cabinet members, leading lawmakers and a large crowd rose to applaud President Ronald Wilson Reagan, there to sign into law the newly-minted Tax Reform Act. Getting the bill passed had required a rare trip by the 40th president to Capitol Hill to browbeat fellow Republicans who'd earlier blocked the measure in the House. \"I think all of us here today know what a herculean effort it took to get this landmark bill to my desk,\" Reagan said to the assembled crowd. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 shifted a large part of the tax burden from individuals to corporations; it also exempted millions of low-income households from federal income taxes. Reagan called it \"a sweeping victory for fairness\" where \"vanishing loopholes and a minimum tax will mean that everybody and every corporation pay their fair share.\" Bruce Bartlett, a former domestic policy adviser in the Reagan White House says fairness was the touchstone for the Tax Reform Act. \"Keep in mind that one of the most important elements of that deal was that Ronald Reagan agreed to raise the capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 28 percent, because he agreed with the Democrats that capital gains and ordinary income ought to be taxed at the same rate,\" says Brooks, who's also the author of The Benefit and the Burden, a new book on tax reform. 1986 Vs. 2011 It took more than two years to produce that tax code overhaul. During that time, Reagan went on the road to plead his case for the plan. At a high school in Atlanta, Georgia in 1985, Reagan said they were going to \"close the unproductive loopholes that allow some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share.\" Meanwhile in Congress, Democrats and Republicans worked together to merge competing proposals for tax reform. Still in office today, Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont was there during the passage of the bill. He says it was a different era. \"We had a lot of grownups in both parties, people who actually wanted the government to work,\" Leahy says. Another Senate Democrat, Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad, says for this divided Congress, it's a much heavier lift to agree on a sweeping deficit reduction plan. \"Because the extremes on both sides are more extreme,\" Conrad says. Democrats want more taxes to help close deficits, but Republicans say no, not even for the wealthiest. \"It is patently false, does not further the debate, to run around saying the rich are not paying their fair share,\" says Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a darling of the Tea Party. President Obama, for his part, vows he'll veto any deficit reduction deal that asks nothing from the very wealthy. Obama has stated that he does not want a one-sided deal that \"hurts the folks who are most vulnerable.\" The biggest difference between 1986 and the current situation in Congress, says former Reagan White House adviser Bartlett, is that this time each side is focused on what it stands to lose. \"The 1986 act was really a coming-together of the liberal idea of getting rid of tax loopholes with the conservative idea of flattening the tax rates,\" he says. \"And so each side felt that they had something to gain by the effort.\" Still, Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner says with the financial world keeping a close eye on Congress, a deficit reduction deal has got to be reached. He says if it includes a big tax reform like the one a quarter century ago, so much the better. \"The urgency is even greater now, [and] the politics may be tougher.\" And the time is, by far, much shorter.Copyright 2011 National Public Radio.

        "webpage": "Stock Market Lookahead Stocks brace for fiscal cliff reckoning By Ben Rooney @ben_rooney The deadline to avert a looming fiscal crisis is fast approaching. Investors are hoping for the best, but bracing for the worst. Can the stock market shake off yet another punt by Congress? It just might. For weeks, many have worried that no resolution to the fiscal cliff would lead to the kind of brutal sell-off that followed the voting down of the TARP bailout and the downgrade of America's credit rating. Now, with the deadline fast approaching and no clear resolution in sight, strategists aren't so sure. \"I don't know how the market is going to react,\" said Ben Schwartz, chief market strategist at Lightspeed Financial. \"But I do know that people are upset with what's going on in Washington.\" The dysfunction in Washington has cast a pall over Wall Street since Election Day. But despite all the hand-wringing, stocks are currently trading at levels seen just before President Obama won a second term. So, where do stocks go from here? Good question. Much depends on what House lawmakers do Sunday, when they meet for a last-ditch round of budget talks. The hope is that a stopgap measure is put in place to prevent some of the tax hikes and spending cuts set to take effect on Jan. 1. Related: Going over the cliff: What changes, what doesn't Here are two possible outcomes: Partial deal, modest sell-off Like most Americans, investors view the budget impasse as an epic failure of leadership in Washington. But they still expect a deal, because doing nothing would be \"political suicide\" for members of both parties. \"We think they will reach some kind of agreement before the end of the year, but not until the very last minute. And it won't be much,\" said Kate Warne, chief investment strategist at Edward Jones. While the details remain sketchy, investors are expecting a short-term extension of Bush-era tax breaks and a suspension of defense spending cuts, among other things. Despite its name, many strategists say the fiscal cliff will not hit the economy right away. That could give lawmakers some time to continue negotiating, but it's unclear how long the market will tolerate such uncertainty. Related: Real fiscal cliff deadline is inauguration \"Unlike the debt ceiling and government shutdowns in the past, not all that much changes on January first,\" Warne said. \"But the tone will get more and more negative as time goes on.\" Even with a stopgap deal, stocks could sell off, according to Peter Tuz, a portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel. \"It doesn't have to be sharp,\" he said. \"A 20% drop would be astounding, but a modest drop would not be surprising.\" No deal, more volatility: Investors could be in for a rude awakening on New Year's day. Despite the political and economic stakes, it's not a given that Congress will act. \"I don't think investors have taken into account that nothing gets done,\" Warne said. Fiscal cliff jitters on the street Wall Street vigilantes believe a sell-off may be necessary to force America's elected officials into action. But there is no guarantee that a riot in the stock market will inspire sound policymaking. For example, the sell-off that followed the S&P downgrade did not result in a long-term solution to the debt ceiling problem, said Lawrence Creatura, a portfolio manager with Federated Clover Investment Advisors. \"The market can act as a disciplinarian, but that doesn't ensure that we get a clean and lasting solution,\" Creatura said. \"We didn't get that last time, and it's probably not realistic to expect it this time either.\" The fiscal cliff was designed to force Washington to deal with the nation's long-term debt problems, but hopes for a grand bargain have diminished as talks devolved into stalemate. The lack of progress on structural issues, such as entitlement spending, means investors will be dealing with a certain degree of political risk long after the fiscal cliff deadline has passed. \"They're not dealing with the big issues,\" Tuz said. \"They'll come up with a band aid approach that just delays the inevitable.\" In the meantime, trading in the stock market could be volatile as investors monitor the blow-by-blow in Washington. The market's fear gauge, the VIX (VIX)has jumped in the last few days -- a sure sign that volatility is indeed on the rise. \"We're floating around here and no one has any real idea where we're going to go,\" Schwartz said. \"That's why volatility has popped up.\" CNNMoney (New York) December 31, 2012: 9:13 AM ET Comments Social Surge - What's Trending"

However, the evidence is scattered and often difficult to access for people outside academia. There is not enough cross-talk between scientist and the industry. Our report fills this gap and shows that human factors are an important part of managing risks.\n'Risks involve uncertainty and wherever there is uncertainty people tend to rationalise their decisions. Acknowledging that biases exist is a hurdle that organisations have to overcome.'\nThe team, which also consists of Dr Tim Hopthrow, Professor Dominic Abrams and Professor Peter Taylor-Gooby, also emphasised the importance of involving the social sciences and humanities in risk analysis.\nCognition: Minding Risks was commissioned by the Emerging Risks team at Lloyd's. As part of the Performance Management Directorate at Lloyd's, it is the responsibility of this team to ensure that the Lloyd's market is aware of potentially significant emerging risks so that it can decide on an appropriate response to them. The team also maintains contact with the academic community, the wider business community and government.\nNeil Smith from Lloyd's Emerging Risk team commented: 'Lloyd's is a world leader in managing specialist and unique risks. At Lloyd's we have a team dedicated to identifying, tracking and managing emerging risks. For some time this team has identified behavioural factors as a key risk facing our industry and financial decision-makers in general.

Economists have a phrase called the \"velocity of money,\" which is the rate at which a unit of money is involved in a transaction. The \"verbosity of money\" is the rate at which the Fed chairman talks about what he might do. Editorial of The New York Sun\nNY Sun\nThe debacle ignited by the Federal Reserve this week invites this question: What would have happened had Chairman Bernanke refrained from saying anything? He held on Wednesday one of his press conferences, announcing that, as the Associated Press put it, the Fed would likely slow its $85 billion-a-month program later this year and end it next year if the economy continued to strengthen. The stock market collapsed, and the value of the dollar soared  -  to more than a 1,300th of an ounce of gold at last check  -  and alarm is spreading.\nWell, let it not be said that The New York Sun failed to warn of this kind of chaos. We did this a bit more than two years ago, in an editorial called \"The Verbal Dollar.\" It quoted a founder of TradeMonster.com, Jon Najarian, as warning Mr. Bernanke's press conferences would ignite a \"giant ramp up in volatility.\" He reasoned that traders \"react to one word removed from a paragraph in a policy statement\" and remarked, \"now he's going to hold a press conference?\" It reminded us that there had long been a tradition of silence among central banks, going back at least to the Bank of England.\nOur editorial related the story of the question that Lord Keynes put in 1929 to the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sir Ernst Harvey. He asked the governor whether it was a practice of the bank never to explain what its policy was. Sir Ernst suggested that it was the bank's practice to \"leave our actions to explain our policy.\" When Keynes plowed on, Sir Ernst famously explained: \"To defend ourselves is somewhat akin to a lady starting to defend her virtue.\" We quoted James Grant, editor of the Interest Rate Observer, as remarking that the Bank of England in its glory days said \"next to nothing\" but conscientiously exchanged bank notes for gold.\nNow it does the opposite  -  and, as Mr. Grant said, \"can't seem to stop talking.\" What in Sam Hill is the point of it? What would have been the harm in holding the meeting the Fed just held and having Mr. Bernanke refrain from trans-fogging the airwaves with a lot of ambiguous blather about what the Fed might or might not do and, instead, simply go to a baseball game or something? It's not as if Mr. Bernanke knows what he will do later this year. He only knows what he might do, and he might not even know that. Economists have a phrase called the \"velocity of money,\" which is the rate at which a unit of money is involved in a transaction. How about the \"verbosity of money,\" which would be the rate at which the Fed chairman talks about what he might do?\nThere was a time when we knew what the central bank or the other issuing authorities would do. Those were years when the law defined a dollar in terms of a given amount of gold. There was a period in our history where the law also specified the dollar in respect of silver. But the bimetallism debate was brought to an end with the Gold Standard Act of 1900 and, the Congress thought, with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which was passed on the condition that it not be taken to authorize an end to the convertibility of the dollar into gold at the value the Congress legislated using its constitutional authority to coin money and regulate its value and to fix the standard of weights and measures. Those years of dollar convertibility were, on a net basis, years of great prosperity and growth.\nIt turns out that the Congress is taking another look at things as we are coming up on the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve. The chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, Kevin Brady, is pushing the Sound Dollar Act, to relieve the Federal Reserve of the duty to pay attention to jobs and instead return its focus to the value of money. He is also pushing a bill to set up  -  on what he calls a \"brutally bipartisan basis\"  -  a Centennial Monetary Commission, that would use the double-jubilee of the Fed to look at the strategic question of monetary reform. It could include a law saying that if we do have a Fed, its directors adhere to the central banker's code and let their actions speak, knowing that silence is golden.\nTo see original article CLICK HEREPrevious External  Bank Crisis Could Pummel the U.S. Economy\nNext External  to avoid another 2008 stock crash More Links"

        "webpage": "From the June-06, 2007 issue of Credit Union Times Magazine \u2022 Subscribe! Building Bridges Between CUSOs, Credit Unions Continue to Pose Challenges, New Model Aims to Protect All\nJune 06, 2007 \u2022 Reprints NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. -- As the number of relationships with CUSOs continues to grow, the provider agreement between the two may sometimes be incomplete or worse, not outline key elements that protect credit unions should certain disagreements arise.\nWith the myriad of responsibilities and squeezed time that management has, the lack of attention to contractual details can result in situations where the credit union \"is caught off guard\" and cannot take the action it desires due to a deficiency in a service provider contract, said Guy Messick, general counsel for NACUSO and head of Messick & Weber, P.C., a law firm that assists credit unions.\nEnter the role of the strategic provider manager. This person would be involved in the service provider selection process, contract negotiation, the implementation process and the monitoring process. The SPM would also meet with the service provider periodically to review the relationship and what steps can be taken to improve the relationship, Messick said. The use of performance standards and relationship monitoring are essential tools for the credit union management to access the success of a service provider relationship.\n\"Credit unions should have staff that are liaisons to the CUSOs and are informed as to the services and products being provided by the CUSO so that the credit union board and regulator know that the credit union has not just handed over the keys to the car to the CUSO,\" Messick said. \"The credit union should at least be a passenger in the car and can monitor the CUSO's driving.\"\nSelecting the \"right\" service provider is approached differently by credit unions. The SPM's role could work with the \"specialized knowledge staff,\" which are experts from a specific department within a credit union, to help make the selection. These experts ideally would have an established performance criteria and the knowledge to evaluate the ability of the candidates to meet the standards, Messick said.\n\"One of the key functions of an SPM would be to network with industry colleagues to gain a knowledge base for the credit union to draw upon for options to meet its service needs,\" Messick said. \"If this is someone's dedicated job, think how much easier it will be for senior management to select a service provider who will best serve the needs of the credit union.\"\nMessick said other advantages are senior managers won't \"have to feel like pathfinders for every new service that is considered\" and the time from conception to market might be greatly compressed.\nThe SPM is one piece of NACUSO's bigger effort to build on the momentum of integrating credit union and CUSO activities, said Tom Davis, president/CEO of NACUSO. It continues to be a struggle for most and barriers still exist, he added.\n\"It's kind of 'we' and 'they' as opposed to 'us,'\" Davis said. \"Not all the time, but CUSOs sometimes get treated as distant stepsisters. The whole issue around the strategic partner manager is how do we integrate the CUSO and credit union.\"\nThe SPM's role would fall under the creation of a chief integration officer, Davis explained. This person would ensure that integration is happening across all lines. The CIO would probably meet more often in the beginning with the appropriate persons and then perhaps for three hours once a month to address any trouble spots. Looking at a credit union's organizational chart, at the top would be the board of directors, then the CEO with the CIO reporting to the CEO. The key strategies might be market expansion and growth, strategic positioning, professional development of employees and operations excellence, Davis said. The traditional departments including investments, human resources, lending and information technology would fall under those four strategies.\n\"I don't think we are adequately aligned to support strategy,\" Davis said. \"[Credit unions] in the U.S. have existed for nearly 100 years and quite frankly, we have the same structure. Of course, we've grown bigger and introduced management teams. Many credit unions are organized to oversee functions but when you structure yourselves like this, you have integration programs.\"\nDavis said AT&T Canada is currently working on a similar integration model. A few CUSOs are prepping to beta test the model, he added. Messick said NACUSO would like to continue dialogues with NCUA on finding out what the regional directors are looking for from CUSOs and credit unions as the two entities meet in the middle.\n\"NCUA is supportive of CUSOs and collaboration but is concerned about any operational service credit unions do not monitor,\" said Messick, emphasizing that NACUSO intends to work with the regulator, CUSOs and credit unions to develop best practices. \"We as an industry have to understand that if we change the way we operate by aggregating services, we need to change the way we assess and monitor the risks.\""

Social networking has established a powerful new model, identifying who is connected to whom and who is influencing whom. Networking goes way beyond social media, however, and extends to family relationships, business relationships, circles of friends, and networks of people who share interests or characteristics. The vast trove of information about networks can be used in unconventional ways. For instance, bank may have an insurance division. Investigating a claim, once accomplished mostly through shoe leather and basic technological capabilities, could be augmented with digital tools. This could lead to surprising results. Let's say there's an auto accident and the two parties claim not to know one another. A search of social media networks, however, tells a different story. In fact, the two parties are friends on Facebook and one follows the other on Twitter. Suddenly, the claim becomes not a run-of-the-mill accident involving two strangers but a possible fraud. Finally, a customer-centric bank would also recognize the power of social media and networking to build brand and reputation and, conversely, to lose standing among existing and prospective customers.\n[Register for Interop here and check out the \"Navigating the Big Spectrum of Big Data's Solutions\" session on October 4 in NYC.]\nHow can banks become customer-centric?\nOnce they define what capabilities they need, such as real-time monitoring and responsiveness and predictive analytics to stay a step ahead of customers, what do banks need to do now to become tomorrow's customer-centric winners? Overall, they need to dramatically improve the customer experience. Technology is at the heart of this effort and banks need to commit to improving their current and future IT systems. One essential technology is in-memory computing. From a common database, in-memory computing helps banks rapidly process massive amounts of customer-centric and transactional banking data. With in-memory computing, banks get the information they need to make real-time or near-real-time business decisions and communicate with customers.\nIn-memory computing is also essential as part of the evolving technology infrastructure. Specifically, the next generation of applications is being built on in-memory platforms. This compares to many current apps, which are built on relational databases. While relational databases are good at storing data, they fall short when it comes to high-speed reporting and analytics. An app built on an in-memory platform can query billions of records in a second. The new generation of apps will also differ significantly in that the information won't have to be transferred from its origination point, such as a loan or deposit system. Relational platforms require that data be transferred to a reporting system in order to be analyzed. Not only do integrated in-memory systems make it exponentially faster to access and analyze data, the data is also much higher quality because it doesn't need to be transferred, which could affect its accuracy and completeness. Next-generation applications also have another significant benefit - they can be used for predictive analytics, which is one of the most important and fast-growing trends for banks and other businesses. Stand out with innovative products and services\nEqually important, banks need to stay relevant and cement customer relationships by developing innovative products and services that drive growth. They might develop a product, for example, that helps customers save for the care of aging parents or addresses other common issues shared by tens of millions of people. If banks can position themselves as problem-solvers, they can create an emotional connection, drive loyalty and reduce churn. Customers appear to be willing to relinquish control over some of their information if it means a better customer experience. A recent survey by Ernst & Young found that 70 percent of consumers would provide more data about themselves if it helped the bank recommend a more appropriate account or deliver a better service.\nLead the industry into the future\nWhile progress has been incremental, banks have no choice but to focus on real-time customer centricity. At bottom, that means building capacity to understand individual customers' behavior and preferences; anticipate their needs; and create the right strategies to provide them with the customized service and products. Banks need to act now to be sure they're at the forefront of the new standards in banking.\nEric Stine is SVP and general manager of financial services for SAP"

        "webpage": "The Debt Alarm Sham\nDemocrats and Republicans alike depicted a hellscape if the federal budget \"sequester\" was allowed to take effect on March 1. The only difference is that Republicans were looking forward to blaming the apocalypse on President Obama. That is, until House Speaker John Boehner was reminded that in July 2011 he told House Republicans the sequestration process was included in the Budget Control Act of 2011 to force $1.2 trillion in cuts across the board over 10 years if a joint committee couldn't agree to more targeted cuts and/or revenue increases.\nBoehner thought that, as the sequester deadline approached, the House would be able to force the Senate and President Obama to accept a substitute bill that would keep the military budget largely intact but force the cuts disproportionately on domestic programs. (But Republicans didn't bother to pass that bill in the current Congress. Instead, they left town.)\nWhen the President insisted that any sequester deal include tax reforms that limit tax breaks for the wealthy, Republicans balked, saying they would not go beyond the restoration of the pre-Bush tax rates for the wealthiest Americans that was approved in January. The Republican intransigence on taxes is proof that their alarms over the federal budget deficit are a sham. Rational Republicans know that budget cutting during a recession doesn't close a deficit; it merely puts more people out of work  -  an estimated 750,000 jobs could be lost from the sequester  -  and those lost jobs reduce tax revenue, further increasing the deficit. We know that tax rates must generate about 20% of the gross domestic product during normal economic times to balance the federal budget. That's what Bill Clinton and the Democrats set up in 1993 when they raised tax rates modestly without a single Republican vote in favor. Instead, Republican leaders denounced the Clinton tax-raising budget as an economy killer that would certainly bring on a recession. Of course, the economy boomed. Through the '90s we saw low unemployment rates, the Treasury reaped the benefits and, when he left the White House, Clinton turned over to new President George W. Bush a balanced budget that was on course to pay off the national debt by 2010. But Bush denounced the surplus as proof that the government was collecting too much money. Then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that paying off the national debt too fast could be bad for the nation. So instead Bush cut taxes on the wealthy, even as he ramped up two wars. The problem of retiring the national debt was solved! Republicans did not discover the problems of the ballooning debt until Jan. 20, 2009. While Barack and Michelle Obama were making the rounds of Inaugural balls, GOP leaders met secretly to vow to do everything they could to make sure Obama did not succeed in pulling the economy out of the tailspin Bush had put it in.\nRevenue as a percentage of the GDP bottomed out at 15.1% in the depth of the Great Recession in 2009 and 2010, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. Deficits of $1.4 trillion in 2009 and $1.3 trillion in 2010, when measured as a share of GDP, were the largest since the end of World War II  -  representing 10% and 8.9% of the nation's output, respectively. But with the economy in recovery and the slightly higher tax rates on the wealthy that were approved in January, tax revenue this year is expected to increase to 17.8% of GDP and 19.2% by 2017 under current laws.\nIf those laws do not change, the Congressional Budget Office reported Feb. 5, the budget deficit will shrink this year to $845 billion, or 5.3% of the GDP, its smallest size since 2008. But the CBO also reported that the economy shrank by a tenth of 1% in the last quarter of 2012, largely because of a reduction in federal spending, and the fiscal contraction would shrink the growth rate to 1.4% this fiscal year. The nonpartisan CBO expects deficits to continue to shrink over the next few year to 2.4% of GDP by 2015. Bu"

They said the Gozi virus had infected 40,000 computers in the United States since 2005, including 190 at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, along with computers in Germany, Great Britain, Poland, France, Finland, Italy, Turkey and elsewhere.\n\"This case should serve as a wake-up call to banks and consumers alike because cybercrime remains one of the greatest threats we face, and it is not going away anytime soon,\" Bharara said. \"It threatens individuals, businesses and governments alike.\"\nHe told a news conference that cybercriminals \"believe that their online anonymity and their distance from New York render them safe from prosecution, but nothing could be further from the truth.\"\nVenizelos said law enforcement had seized 51 computer servers in Romania, along with laptops, desktops and external hard drives, accumulating more than 250 terabytes of information.\n\"That vast pile of data is almost certain to aid criminal investigation at FBI offices around the country as well as law enforcement agencies around the world,\" he said. \"It is more than standard boilerplate to say that this investigation is very much ongoing.\"\nSo far, the investigation has produced three arrests, including that of Nikita Kuzmin, a 25-year-old Russian who pleaded guilty to computer intrusion and fraud charges in Manhattan in May 2011, admitting his role in creating the virus. The plea by the Moscow resident was followed by the arrest in November of a co-conspirator in Latvia and another in Romania last month. Extradition proceedings are under way against both on various criminal charges, including conspiracy.\nThe NASA breach occurred from Dec. 14, 2007, to Aug. 9, 2012, with the most damage occurring between May and August last year, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The infected computers sent data without user authorization, including login credentials for an eBay account and a NASA email account, details of visited websites and the contents of Google chat messages.\nMihai Ionut Paunescu, 28, who was arrested in Romania, set up online infrastructure that allowed others to distribute destructive viruses and malicious software, including ones dubbed Zeus Trojan, SpyEye and BlackEnergy, according to a criminal complaint filed against him. The document said Paunescu, a Romanian national residing in Bucharest, was also known as \"Virus.\"\nThe Gozi virus was designed in 2005 and distributed beginning in 2007, when it was secretly installed onto each victim's computer in a manner that left it virtually undetectable by antivirus software.\nDeniss Calovskis, 27, was arrested in Riga, Latvia, where he is a citizen and resident, on charges including bank fraud conspiracy.\nExtradition proceedings had begun to bring them to New York for trial. Charges against Kuzmin carry a maximum penalty of 95 years in prison while charges against Calovskis carry up to 67 years and charges against Paunescu have a maximum penalty of 60 years.\nAuthorities say Kuzmin began designing the Gozi virus in 2005 to steal personal bank account information of individuals and businesses in a widespread way. They said he hired a programmer to write the software and began renting it to others for a weekly fee, advertising it on Internet forums devoted to cybercrime and other criminal activities. Beginning in 2009, Kuzmin offered the code to others for $50,000 plus a guaranteed share of future profits, court documents said.\nAuthorities said Calovskis had training and expertise in computer programming when he was hired by a co-conspirator to upgrade the virus with new code that would deceive victims into divulging additional personal information, such as a mother's maiden name. Federal authorities sought at least $50 million from Calovskis, an amount they said was obtained through the conspiracy."

The report, entitled \"ATM Security,\" summarizes the state of ATM safety -- including the status of various legislative efforts -- in the United States. The issue has been a growing concern to bankers, as ATM crimes and the attention given them by the media have both risen in recent years. The ABA report acknowledges that ATM crime is a serious problem. However, the statistics it contains also suggest that there is no need for bankers to panic. One-in-a-Million Chance According to numbers gathered by the ABA in the late 1980s, less than one ATM transaction in a million results in a robbery or assault against the customer making the transaction. This estimate is considered conservative by at least one ATM security expert who maintains that the actual rate of crime was -- and remains closer to -- one for every three million transactions. \"Over the last few years, the number of ATM crimes has risen, but the number of total ATM transactions has risen right along with it. As a result, the rate of ATM crime has stayed fairly level.\" said Barry Schreiber, a criminal justice professor at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota. Mr. Schreiber, who publishes an ATM security newsletter, noted further that some areas of the country experience more crime than others. In California, for instance, one in 1.2 million ATM transactions is affected by a crime, according to 1993 figures from the California Bankers Association. New York and several southern states have similarly high ATM crime rates. ATM users in the Midwest appear to be much less likely to be robbed or assaulted at an ATM, Mr. Schreiber and other observers said. The ABA report asserts that ATM crime -- like regular street muggings -- is not necessarily preventable. \"Irrational behavior (such as that which occurs in a crime driven by the needs of chug addiction) is seldom influenced by rational deterrents, such as security cameras, jail time, or other penalties,\" the report said. ...

        "webpage": "Projections of economic well-being for Social Security beneficiaries in 2022 and 2062.\nPolicymakers considering potential changes to the Social Security program need to be able to assess how such changes would affect the economic well-being of future retirees. The first step to understanding these effects is to determine the well-being of future retirees under the current Social Security system. To this end, this article projects the retiree populations aged 62 or older in 2022 and 2062 using the Social Security Administration's MINT (Modeling Income in the Near Term) model and assesses their well-being. Because no one measure can fully capture whether future retirees will have adequate resources to meet their needs, we employ several indicators to assess retirement prospects. In addition, because current-law Social Security promises cannot be financed from current-law taxes, we project an alternative 2062 baseline that adjusts Social Security benefits downward to reflect the amounts that current-law taxes can support. Our results illustrate the importance of using several measures when assessing the well-being of future Social Security beneficiaries. When using absolute measures, retirement well-being will improve for Social Security beneficiaries in 2062 compared with those in 2022. Median per capita income of Social Security beneficiaries is projected to increase by a third (in real terms) between 2022 and 2062, with a corresponding decline in projected poverty rates. In addition, median financial wealth will increase between 2022 and 2062. Relative measures of well-being, however, suggest a decline in well-being between Social Security beneficiaries in 2022 and those in 2062. The share of beneficiaries who have low income relative to their peers, measured as the share whose income-to-needs ratio is less than half of the median ratio, will increase over time. In addition, income replacement rates are projected to fall between 2022 and 2062, indicating a decline in how well-being during retirement compares with that during the working years. And although median financial wealth will increase between 2022 and 2062, it will actually fall relative to economy-wide average wages. Projected improvements over time would lessen, and declines would be exacerbated, if instead of assuming the payment of currently scheduled Social Security benefits we assumed that benefits would be reduced according to what is payable under current-law taxes. Regardless of which measure of well-being is used, certain groups fare worse than others, including beneficiaries who never married, nonwhites, beneficiaries without a high school degree, and those with fewer years of labor force experience and low lifetime earnings. These vulnerable groups are likely to be more dependent on Social Security benefits for their retirement income. As a result, they fare particularly poorly under the assumption that Social Security benefits are reduced to reflect what is payable under current-law taxes."

Indeed, Evergreen recently was called out by Federal Reserve board member Sarah Bloom Raskin as \"an effective model of local economic development,\" Prof. Folbre notes.\nLearning our lesson: Data released today by the Northeast Ohio Council on Higher Education offer some hope for small and large businesses looking to bolster the quality of their work forces.The nonprofit reports the college attainment rate of Northeast Ohio residents \"has eclipsed 30%\" and has climbed in each of the last four years. About 33,500 students now earn associate's, bachelor's or advanced degrees in Northeast Ohio each year, up about 11% from 2006, NOCHE reports.It estimates Northeast Ohio has about 925,000 residents with a college degree.Northeast Ohio higher education institutions, which currently enroll more than 50,000 new undergraduate students annually, have increased new student enrollment by 20% since 2006, according to NOCHE. Total undergraduate and graduate enrollment has increased by 24% to more than 226,000 in that time.The bright side: Middle-market companies in the Cleveland area \"are more optimistic about their business performance over the next 12 months than their counterparts nationwide,\" according to results of a survey of 100 companies conducted by the Greater Cleveland Partnership.GCP said its 2013 Middle-Market Forum found that 61% of Northeast Ohio respondents are projecting growth of 5% or more this year, compared with 43% of executives surveyed nationwide by the National Center for the Middle Market who project such growth.Within the Northeast Ohio group, 33% anticipate growth of at least 10%, compared with 22% of national respondents.The survey also found more optimism among Northeast Ohio companies about adding jobs in 2013, with 59% expecting to grow their employee base compared with 38% of the national group.Swing by this weekend: Saturday is a big day for the Paisley Monkey in Lakewood.The charming children's retailer on Detroit Avenue is hosting an event to mark its expansion into the former location of Tess' Tender Touch.

She wanted to analyse the socio-economic impact of informal trading in South Africa.\nAfter a web search, Nadine discovered that Professor Martin Breitenbach from the Department of Economics at the University of Pretoria had conducted extensive research in the field of development economics that also included research on informal traders.\nMartin has, some years ago, conducted surveys within the black township communities, which shed some light on how they operate and with what kind of informal activities they earn their livelihoods. These surveys were conducted throughout South Africa and repeated in the same areas over a number of years. Martin was responsible for conducting the surveys in the Pretoria townships of Mamelodi, Atteridgeville, Soshanguve and Mabopane.\nThe majority of informal traders in these townships were found to be illiterate with only around 40% of the participants having completed a grade ten or higher qualification, and roughly 58% were women. By far the majority of informal enterprises were survivalist enterprises. Some of these traders supported up to five or six dependents and barely made enough to maintain a minimum level of subsistence of $2 a day for them and their dependants. In recent years, many immigrants from elsewhere in Africa, some highly skilled, were using informal trading as a springboard to employment in the formal economy, while they awaited legal residence.\nDuring the interview, Martin emphasised the difficulty of measuring the size of the informal economy accurately, referring to the recent controversial debate between StatsSA and Adcorp as an example of how widely estimates may vary. He also pointed to the global rise in unemployment and the increasing contribution of the informal sector as an employer in South Africa and elsewhere in the world. Martin emphasised that informal traders only represent a small share of total informal economic activity by value, stating that some informal enterprises could reach turnovers of R1 million or more and sometimes include quite sophisticated manufacturing technology.\nAsked about the size of the informal sector in South Africa, Martin said that estimates of employment in the informal economy varies between 25% and 30% of total employment, whereas the informal economy's estimated contribution to total income in the South African economy varies between 10% and 12% .\nThe report was broadcast in two parts, Part I broadcast on 28 February 2012 and Part II on 20 April 2012.

One of the prime rules of long-term wealth building, he says in a recent research report, is to be the provider of scarce capital. An investor should prudently invest in opportunities that other people might hesitate to approach, he suggests.\n\"When it comes to emerging markets, the consensus still focuses on commodities and industrial plays,\" Bernstein says. \"We have a different view: We'd emphasize consumer-oriented investments in those markets.\" He says that consumer products markets in emerging economies are significantly underdeveloped versus those in the more mature economies.\nRussia, for one, is quickly laying the foundation for a consumer economy that can produce rock-solid returns, says Patricia Cloherty, chairman and CEO of Delta Russia Fund, which was launched in June 2004 with $120 million in capital. Cloherty, a former deputy administrator of the US Small Business Administration, says Russia is an entrepreneur's paradise with a nascent consumer economy. In a recent presentation she notes that there is a lot of pent-up consumer demand in Russia. Emerging companies are finding a growing supply of young Russians returning for opportunities at home after receiving degrees in the West, she says.\nThis article appeared in issue December 2006"

It is also the first case where a prospective class of victimized homeowners is suing an investment bank directly rather than the subprime lender whose loans the bank bought.\nThe lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Michigan, the National Consumer Law Center, and Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, a San Francisco-based law firm, on behalf of five Detroit residents and Michigan Legal Services. The complaint asks the court to certify the case as a class action. As many as 6,000 black homeowners in the Detroit area may have suffered similar discrimination.\nWhile the case concerns lending abuses in Detroit, these practices were common throughout the financial services industry and victimized black and Latino neighborhoods nationwide, according to Anthony D. Romero, ACLU executive director.\n\"With this lawsuit, real victims of the subprime lending scandal are stepping forward to hold investment banks like Morgan Stanley accountable for the devastation the banks wrought in their lives and in our economy,\" Romero said. \"Illegal practices surrounding mortgage-backed securities robbed people of their homes, violated our civil rights laws and left all Americans holding the bag as our economy teetered on the brink of another Great Depression.\"\nThe five homeowners in the suit received their loans from now-defunct New Century Mortgage Corp., a one-time major player in subprime lending. As Morgan Stanley ramped up its mortgage-backed securities business starting in 2004, it became New Century's largest buyer of subprime loans.\nMorgan Stanley provided funds to New Century to originate the loans, and dictated the terms of the loans it wanted and ultimately purchased for its securitized pools. It pushed New Century to issue certain types of loans with no concern about risk, because it made its profit at the outset, when the securities were created and sold. Because minority residents of the Detroit region have been subjected to decades of housing and lending discrimination, and had fewer alternative sources of credit, they were natural targets for these predatory loans.\n\"Morgan Stanley actively encouraged the proliferation of irresponsible subprime mortgage loans, the complaint charges, in order to feed its hunger for purchasing, pooling, and securitizing mortgage debt for sale to investors,\" said Elizabeth J. Cabraser, a partner at Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, and co-counsel for the plaintiffs. \"The targeting of communities of color for loans that unfairly raises the risk of default and foreclosure is the quintessential 'reverse-redlining' outlawed by the Federal Fair Housing Act.\"\nAmong those affected is Rubbie McCoy, who said her mortgage broker falsified information on her loan application even though she objected. The broker also omitted critical details, including the fact that after two years, New Century would no longer pay the taxes or insurance on her loan.\n\"I've seen firsthand the devastation banks like Morgan Stanley have caused in communities like mine. When I first moved into my home, I knew every neighbor and most of the homes were occupied. Today, the majority of homes stand abandoned and stripped,\" McCoy said. \"I don't like to say that I am losing my home, instead I tell my family that I'm fighting for my home. The truth is I'm afraid that today will be the day a sheriff kicks us out. No one should live with this fear.\""

        "webpage": "The taxman is now playing doctor\nJonnelle Marte\nPublished: Feb 5, 2013 8:59 a.m. ET\nHow today's tax returns will impact tomorrow's medical bills\nJonnelleMarte\nWhen they file their returns this year, some Americans will get a medical bill with their tax bill. Starting next January, the Affordable Care Act mandates that every American have health coverage, and those who remain uninsured will pay a penalty. The extent to which one is eligible for federal subsidies to buy insurance, and the penalties for failing to comply with the mandate, will both be determined using one number: the adjusted income reported to the Internal Revenue Service this year. \"So much of the Affordable Care Act is being implemented through the tax code,\" says Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute at H&R Block. And for many taxpayers, \"their tax situation will factor into health-care decisions as well,\" she says. Jim Barber / Shutterstock.com\nThe penalty, which was upheld as a tax by the Supreme Court in June, will vary per family based on their size and income. The fee starts at $95 per person next year, or 1% of household income above the minimum threshold for filing a tax return - whichever is greater. And the penalty is scheduled to increase each year to $695 per person in 2016, or 2.5% of income. (After that, the penalty will be adjusted each year for inflation.) For a single person earning $50,000, the charge would start at $400 next year, estimates H&R Block. And for a family of four with two children and a household income of $100,000, foregoing insurance would add another $800 to their tax bill -- a sum that would be deducted from any refunds. (The penalty is cut in half for children.) The government will provide subsidies, which would cap how much families spend on insurance premiums to a portion of their income. These subsidies will be available to those earning incomes of up to 400% the poverty rate, which works out to roughly $45,000 for an individual, and $92,000 for a family of four. See H&R Block Health Care Estimator To be sure, people who get health insurance through their employers or through a government program like Medicaid will not be impacted by the penalty. But those shopping for insurance on the individual market may still opt to pay the penalty, experts say. Annual health insurance premiums for people working at small firms averaged $5,600 for individuals and $15,200 for families in 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Of course, the decision to remain uninsured could end up being far more expensive if individuals face unexpected medical emergencies.) J.W. Marriott to Obama: Lower the tax rate(1:25)\nJ.W. Marriott explains why the federal government needs to solve its spending problems, how much corporate taxes should be cut and why the U.S. is still a great place for business. Photo: AP\nIn order to avoid the penalty, taxpayers will need to buy the minimum amount of health insurance required under the health-care law. One way to meet that amount is to purchase a plan offered in the individual insurance exchanges being set up by health-care reform, where individuals or small-business employees can shop for health coverage - possibly with the help of federal subsidies. Levels of coverage will vary, and some plans will have to offer essential benefits including hospital, emergency, pediatric benefits and other services. Dental-only plans, for example, won't be enough to avoid the penalty. Tax preparers say clients are already asking questions about how health-care reform will impact their tax bills - and vice versa. At H&R Block, preparers are calculating what a taxpayer's insurance costs might be by using their returns to estimate the federal subsidy they might receive. They're also talking to families about what penalty they would have to pay over the years if they decide not to buy insurance. Mark Steber, chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, says they are fielding questions from taxpayers on the penalty and how insurance subsidies will work, and that the firm is evaluating if it will add a health-care component to its tax prep services."

Jack Reed, D-R.I. He's been leading the effort to include another extension of benefits for the long-term unemployed in any deal to avert looming tax increases and massive spending cuts in January.\n\"Many of these people are struggling to pay mortgages, to provide education for their children,\" Reed said this past week as President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, rejected each other's opening offers for a deficit deal.\nEmergency jobless benefits for about 2.1 million people out of work more than six months will cease Dec. 29, and 1 million more will lose them over the next three months if Congress doesn't extend the assistance again.\nSince the collapse of the economy in 2008, the government has poured $520 billion -- an amount equal to about half its annual deficit in recent years -- into unemployment benefit extensions.\nWhite House officials have assured Democrats that Obama is committed to extending them another year, at a cost of about $30 billion, as part of an agreement for sidestepping the fiscal cliff and reducing the size of annual increases in the federal debt.\n\"The White House has made it clear that it wants an extension,\" said Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.\nRepublicans have been relatively quiet on the issue lately. They demanded and won savings elsewhere to offset the cost of this year's extension, requiring the government to sell some of its broadcasting airwaves and making newly hired federal workers contribute more toward their pensions.\nBoehner did not include jobless benefits in his counteroffer response this past week to Obama's call for $1.6 trillion in new taxes over the next decade, including raising the top marginal rates for the highest-paid 2 percent.\nLong-term unemployment remains a persistent problem. About 5 million people have been out of work for six months or more, according to the Bureau of labor Statistics. That's about 40 percent of all unemployed workers.\nThe Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent, the lowest in nearly four years. But much of the decline was because of people so discouraged about finding a job that they quit looking for one.\nDemocrats have tried to keep a flame burning under the issue. Ending the extended benefits would \"deal a devastating blow to our economy,\" 42 Democratic senators wrote Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., this past week.\nThe Congressional Budget Office said in a study last month that extending the current level of long-term unemployment benefits another year would add 300,000 jobs to the economy. The average benefit of about $300 a week tends to get spent quickly for food, rent and other basic necessities, the report said, stimulating the economy.\nThe liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that extended unemployment benefits lifted 2.3 million Americans out of poverty last year, including 600,000 children.\nStates provide the first 20 weeks to 26 weeks of unemployment benefits for eligible workers who are seeking jobs. When those are exhausted, federal benefits kick in for up to 47 more weeks, depending on the state's unemployment rate.\nThe higher a state's unemployment rate, the longer state residents can qualify for additional weeks of federal unemployment benefits.\nOnly seven states with\njobless rates of 9 percent or more now qualify for all 47 weeks.\nCongress already cut back federal jobless benefits this year.\nTaken together with what states offer, the benefits could last up to 99 weeks. Cutting the maximum to 73 weeks has already cut off benefits to about 500,000 people.\nOpponents of benefit extensions argue that they can be a disincentive for taking a job.\n\"Prolonged benefits lead some unemployed workers to spend too much time looking for jobs that they would prefer to find, rather than focusing on jobs that they are more likely to find,\" said James Sherk, a labor policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.\nBut Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, noted that unemployment checks add up to about $15,000 a year. \"That's poverty level,\" he said. \"This is not something people just want to continue on, they want to get jobs.\"\nFollow Sam Hananel's labor coverage at"

        "webpage": "Windfall revenues from both foreign aid and natural resource exports can weaken governments' incentives to design and maintain efficient tax systems\nA large body of literature shows that states benefiting from oil and other natural resource rents suffer from a \"resource curse\": they tend to be less democratic, more corrupt, and less interested in building state capacity for collecting taxes. Some studies have extended the resource curse phenomenon to official development assistance, arguing that both aid and resource revenues can be thought of as sovereign rents that generate dysfunctional rent-seeking behavior, and tend to receive less scrutiny from legislators and citizens than other revenues.\nArguably, these revenues can reduce a government's dependence on taxes from its own citizens, leading to long-run dependence on foreign aid and erosion of the quality of the tax system. Indeed, empirical work has found foreign aid to reduce tax revenues as a share of national income.\nA recent study by Stephen Knack tests the hypothesized relationship between windfall revenues and the quality of tax systems as measured by the World Bank's Efficiency of Revenue Mobilization (ERM) rating for 135 developing countries. This measure scores countries on a scale of 1 to 6 taking into account a range of tax policy and administration characteristics. Knack finds that high levels of aid do tend to undermine the quality of tax systems. An increase in aid's share of gross national income by about 30 percentage points is associated with between a half-point and a one-point reduction in the ERM rating, depending on the econometric specification used. The effect of aid remains significant under all specifications and is not sensitive to outliers.\nRevenues from natural resources are also associated with weaker tax systems: an increase in net fuel exports per capita of about $500 is associated with a half-point reduction in the ERM rating. However, this effect is neither as strong nor as statistically robust as that of aid, and it is sensitive to a small number of outliers. Moreover, the effect varies substantially depending on which measure of natural resource abundance is used.\nThese findings are inconsistent with existing perspectives on the impact of aid revenues relative to that of natural resource revenues. It has been argued that while aid reduces the need for taxation and thus increases sovereign rents relative to better scrutinized revenues, it comes with various donor-imposed mechanisms of scrutiny that may offset its negative effects by substituting for reduced pressure from citizens.\nThe study warns that while this inconsistency is noteworthy, it may arise due to several factors. For example, it is possible that these data measure aid rents more accurately than they do resource rents. As a result, estimates of the impact of resource rents on quality of tax systems are less accurate than the corresponding estimates for aid, and natural resource revenues may still in fact be more damaging than the latter.\nIn addition, the difference in impacts may be an artifact of the sample. The dependent variable, ERM, is produced only for countries eligible for World Bank loans. Some high-income, resource-abundant countries with large resource rents, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are excluded from the sample. This might bias the results.\nThe study also cautions that policy responses to dependence on windfall revenues should distinguish between the impact of aid on the quality of tax systems and the net impact of all donor activity, which might include policy advice not linked in any way to aid flows. The latter cannot be estimated in the framework of this paper, as aid flows are easily measurable unlike the policy advice that might accompany them.\nGiven this, what can be done to mitigate the negative impact of development aid and natural resource revenues on the quality of governance in less-developed countries? The study presents several options.\n\u2022 Substantially reduce the share of wind-fall revenues going to central governments by bypassing them, for example through distribution of oil revenues and cash grants directly to people, increased delivery of aid through NGOs and private firms or allocation of a larger share of aid to public goods such as agricultural or anti-malarial research.\n\u2022 Scale up donor efforts at technical assistance through revenue reform projects to encourage the expansion of efficient domestic revenue-raising capacity in the long run, as well as through investments to improve tax administration, encourage compliance and broaden the tax base.\n\u2022 Support initiatives calling for disclosure of revenues and expenditures associated with natural resource rents and foreign aid.

The first, on the left, shows a growing portion of covenant-light (\"cov-lite\") bank loans relative to full-covenant bank loans.\u00b9 The second indicator, on the right, shows a growing portion of loan-only bank loan issuers, which remove the benefit of a credit cushion for bank loan investors.\u00b2 Recent studies by Credit Suisse show that recovery rates for cov-lite issuers are 10-15% worse than non-cov-lite issuers, and recovery rates for loan-only unitranche issuers are 15% worse than non-unitranche issuers. As such, there is some structural deterioration in the bank loan market, but the general consensus is that this should not be a 2019 story, but 2-3 years out. This means that there is not a very high concern of a credit crunch in 2019, but potentially in 2020-2021 if prices get to frothy levels again by then.\n\nThat said, defaults remain low, so at least for now, there is no sign of immediate trouble. And spreads have widened out over the last couple of months to be wider than average excluding 2008 and 2009 levels, showing that there has been some release in pressure and the market is perhaps pricing in some of these concerns. Most bank loan strategies are now focused on quality credit selection, avoiding deals with high leverage and unreliable assets or unreliable earnings. That said, as this cycle wears on, we would certainly want to remember that despite their senior secured nature, bank loans are still sub-investment grade debt and should be balanced with a healthy core bond allocation.\n\n\u00b9 Covenant-light means that the bank loan issuer is subject to few restrictions, also known as covenants, in managing its business. For example, covenants could be maximum leverage (debt divided by cash flows) or minimum coverage (cash flows divided by interest expenses). The rise in cov-lite deals has been a reality since 2005 and they appear to be here to stay. One reason for their rise is due to the standardization and syndication of bank loans as a public security, thereby making them become more like high yield bonds, which have very little covenants, and less like private credit.\n\n\u00b2 This means that, in the event of bankruptcy, the bank loan investors do not have a high yield, junior subordinated debt tranche beneath them for the losses to eat into after the equity tranche. The bank loan investors will see immediate losses right after the equity tranche in this case.\n\nThe opinions expressed herein are those of Marquette Associates, Inc.

        "webpage": "Nicholas D. Kristof: How would Romney plan work? See Europe\nBy Nicholas D. Kristof\nMitt Romney's best argument has been simple: Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. economy has remained excruciatingly weak, far underperforming the White House's own projections. That's a fair criticism. But Obama's best response could be this: If you want to see how Romney's economic policies would work out, take a look at Europe. And weep. In the past few years, Germany and Britain, in particular, have implemented precisely the policies that Romney favors, and they have been richly praised by Republicans here as a result. Yet these days those economies seem, to use a German technical term, kaput. Is Europe a fair comparison? Well, Republicans seem to think so, because they came up with it. In the past few years, they've repeatedly cited Republican-style austerity in places like Germany and Britain as a model for America. Let's dial back the time machine and listen up: \"Europe is already setting an example for the U.S.,\" Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Texas, said in 2010. (You know things are bad when a Texas Republican is calling for Americans to study at the feet of those socialist Europeans.) The same year, Karl Rove praised European austerity as a model for America and approvingly quoted the leader of the European Central Bank as saying: \"The idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation is incorrect.\" Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, praised Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for preaching austerity and said: \"It ought to hit home to our president of the United States. It ought to hit all of us here in this country.\" \"The president should learn a lesson from the 'German Miracle,'\" Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., urged on the House floor in July 2011. Also in 2011, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, denounced Obama's economic management and said: \"We need a budget with a bold vision -- like those unveiled in Britain and New Jersey.\" OK. Let's see how that's working out. New Jersey isn't overseas, but since Sessions and many other Republicans have hailed it as a shining model of austerity, let's start there. New Jersey ranked 47th in economic growth last year. When Gov. Chris Christie took office in 2010 and began to impose austerity measures, New Jersey ranked 35th in its unemployment rate; now it ranks 48th. Sen. Sessions, do we really aspire for the same in America as a whole? Something similar has happened internationally. The International Monetary Fund this month downgraded its estimates for global economic growth, with only one major bright spot in the West. That would be the United States, expected to grow a bit more than 2 percent this year and next. In contrast, Europe's economy is expected to shrink this year and have negligible growth next year. The IMF projects that Germany will grow less than 1 percent this year and next, while Britain's economy is contracting this year. Karl Rove, that sounds a lot like stagnation to me. All this is exactly what economic textbooks predicted. Since Keynes, it's been understood that, in a downturn, governments should go into deficit to stimulate demand; that's how we got out of the Great Depression. And recent European data and IMF analyses underscore that austerity in the middle of a downturn not only doesn't help but leads to even higher ratios of debt to economic output. So, yes, Republicans have a legitimate point about the long-term need to curb deficits and entitlement growth. But, no, it isn't reasonable for Republicans to advocate austerity in the middle of a downturn. On that, they're empirically wrong. If there were still doubt about this, we've had a lovely natural experiment in the past few years, as the Republicans in previous years were happy to point out. All industrialized countries experienced similar slowdowns, and the United States under Obama chose a massive stimulus while Germany and Britain chose Republican-endorsed austerity. Neither approach worked brilliantly. Obama's initial economic stimulus created at least 1.4 million jobs, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But that wasn't enough, and it was partly negated by austerity in state and local governments. Still, America's economy is now the fastest growing among major countries in the West, and Britain's is shrinking. Which would you prefer? I'm not suggesting Obama distribute bumper stickers saying: \"It Could Be Worse.\" He might want to stick with: \"Osama's Dead and GM Is Alive.\" Yes, there are differences between Europe and America. But Republicans were right to call attention to this empirical experiment. The results are in. And, as Rep. King suggested, the lessons \"ought to hit all of us here in this country.\" Nicholas D.

        "webpage": "Romney's Success Sparks GOP Debate Over Capitalism\nScott Horsley\nIn his New Hampshire primary victory speech Tuesday, Mitt Romney chided GOP rivals for challenging his record as the former head of a private equity firm. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\nEven as he claimed victory in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, Mitt Romney fired a defensive salvo against Republican rivals who have begun to question whether he made his fortune at the expense of U.S. workers. \"The country already has a leader who divides us with the bitter politics of envy. We have to offer an alternative vision,\" Romney told supporters in Manchester, N.H. \"I stand ready to lead us down a different path, where we're lifted up by our desire to succeed, not dragged down by a resentment of success.\" But Randy Johnson, who lost his job at an Indiana paper company after Romney's investment firm, Bain Capital, bought the company's plant in 1994, has been loudly criticizing Romney and his methods. \"He made money  -  if that was his goal  -  he made a lot of bucks,\" Johnson, who has been shadowing Romney on the campaign trail, told reporters in Iowa. \"Is that what we want? People that are worried about money more than the workers?\" Private Equity The scrutiny has also shined a spotlight on the lucrative business known as private equity, where Romney made his fortune. Steve Judge, who heads a private equity trade group in Washington, D.C., says the business model is pretty simple: \"We buy companies that have significant potential for growth, either because they have great promise or because they need to be turned around. We invest capital and effort and expertise to improve their performance and hopefully increase their value.\" There are a number of ways to do that. A once-neglected company like Dunkin' Donuts might use an infusion of private equity money to grow, open new stores and hire new workers. That's a win for everybody. But Colin Blaydon, who heads the Tuck Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship at Dartmouth College, says sometimes boosting value can also mean cutting costs. \"You might ask your employees to take lower pay. You may shift the jobs somewhere else. You may replace people with robots,\" he says. In that case, the gains are not so widely shared. Private equity firms can also multiply their profits through \"financial engineering,\" borrowing most of the money to buy a company, then quickly recouping their own costs through dividends and management fees. It's a bit like a homeowner who puts $5,000 down on a house, then quickly withdraws $10,000 on a home equity loan. Howard Anderson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says some companies crumble under the resulting debt load. \"Sometimes a company couldn't sustain the debt and they had already taken money out,\" he says. Bain's Record In fact, of Bain's top 10 investments, four of the companies ended in bankruptcy. But Bain still walked away with more than $500 million in profit. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News that doesn't sound like the free market. \"It's one thing to say, look, if a company has failed despite your best efforts, and you've put money into it and you take a loss right along with all the workers, that's free enterprise,\" he said. \"But if the rich guy's taking all the money and the working guy's being left an unemployment check, that's not sound, healthy capitalism. That's the kind of thing that I think frankly makes people very suspicious of Wall Street.\" Judge says firms like Bain could not survive if they routinely drove companies into bankruptcy. Dartmouth's Blaydon adds that while private equity's bare-knuckle cost-cutting may be painful, it's really what any good manager should do. \"That's what we want in our economy, if our economy is going to be more valuable and more competitive,\" he said. But workers like Johnson aren't so sure. Bain Capital made more than $100 million off his company, even though the plant shut down and the company wound up in bankruptcy. \"To this day, I still don't understand why people think that making profit over good jobs, helping communities, families  -  at what point does the profit take control?\" he said. That's a question Romney's rivals will be asking in South Carolina, where the unemployment rate is near 10 percent, and where a superPAC supporting Gingrich has threatened to spend millions on anti-Romney advertising. And if Romney wins the GOP nomination, it may be a question voters are asking in November.\nThe Democratic Debate Clock: Which Issues Got The Most Time\nOn 'Late Show,' The Spotlight Was Just Out Of Reach For Jeb Bush\nFor GOP, Obama's 'Very Ideological' Speech Not Wearing Well Governing\nResolute Rhetoric: Obama's Confident Case For Government"

After 2018 saw deal makers underperform in terms of shareholder value for an unprecedented fifth consecutive quarter, and record their worst annual performance for a decade, what can potential acquirers expect in 2019?\n\nM&A predictions for 2019\n\nBased on short and long-term trends revealed by the data, as well as conversations with clients and colleagues, Jana Mercereau, Head of Corporate Mergers and Acquisitions for Great Britain at Willis Towers Watson, has shared five M&A predictions for 2019:\n\nThings can only get better in 2019 - 2018 was a tough year for deal makers, who recorded their worst annual performance since the financial crash in 2008. Although complex headwinds remain, we are optimistic that the market will bottom out in 2019 and, supported by more clarity over the direction of the US administration and Brexit, improve the position of buyers in achieving better value from their deals.\n\nFall in foreign deals - We expect to see a global decline in the number of cross-border deals due to regulatory constraints fueled by an increasing trend towards protectionism. This will lead to a more defensive strategy of domestic consolidation, for which some nations will be better equipped. The US domestic M&A market, for example, has traditionally shown itself to be very robust, so we expect volumes to remain stable as acquirers focus their firepower on domestic targets.\n\nNo uptick expected in APAC - As well as a significant drop in deal volume, Asia-Pacific acquirers recorded the worst annual performance of all regions in 2018, with the underperformance of 17.1pp (percentage points) below the regional MSCI Index. We expect M&A activity from Chinese companies to be muted in 2019, impacting volumes across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nOutside interest in the UK remains strong - While ongoing uncertainty around Brexit is likely to translate into less M&A activity for UK companies in 2019, the positive results enjoyed by non-UK acquirers when buying in the UK will see Britain remain one of the most popular M&A target nations.\n\nMega deals continue to struggle - There were 17 mega deals in 2018 (those valued at over $10bn), which underperformed the market by 14.5pp, the worst performance of all deal types. Global political uncertainty, from trade wars and growing protectionism to Brexit, will continue in 2019 and negatively impact mega deals in particular, as buyers will be cautious of transactions that take a long time to complete in a volatile dealmaking environment.\n\nJana Mercereau, Head of Corporate Mergers and Acquisitions for Great Britain, said: \"The ability to deliver anticipated benefits in terms of shareholder value for the buyer is at a ten-year low. On top of this, the market stress that characterized 2018 will persist, with rising regulatory uncertainty, ongoing trade and tariff negotiations, including Brexit talks and the US-China trade disputes, making it even more challenging to deliver deals successfully.\n\n\"Technology disruption, changing consumer behavior, the slowdown in the growth of emerging markets and record cash reserves will drive companies to get into the M&A market. With many targets looking more expensive than they were during previous M&A peaks, such as in 1999 during the dot-com boom and in 2008 before the global financial crash, there has never been a more important time for decision-makers to focus on target selection, diligence and execution before jumping into a deal if they are to give themselves the best chance of success.\""

        "webpage": "Currency war and peace - Taipei Times\nCurrency war and peace\nRather than quarreling about 'currency wars,' world leaders should work to maximize the liquidity created by unconventional monetary policies and channel it into long-term investment\nBy Otaviano Canuto Illustration: Mountain People\nMuch of the hype surrounding last month's meeting in Moscow of G20 finance ministers and central bankers was dedicated to so-called \"currency wars,\" which some developing-economy officials have accused advanced economies of waging by pursuing unconventional monetary policies. However, another crucial issue  -  that of long-term investment financing  -  was largely neglected, even though the endgame for unconventional monetary policy will require the revitalization or creation of new long-term assets and liabilities in the global economy.The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 drove up risk premiums and triggered panic in financial markets, weakening assets in the US and elsewhere, and threatening to provoke a credit crunch. To avoid asset fire-sales  -  which would have led to the disorderly unraveling of private-sector balance sheets, possibly triggering a new \"Great Depression\" or even bringing down the eurozone  -  advanced countries' central banks began to purchase risky assets and increase lending to financial institutions, thus expanding the money supply.While fears of meltdown have dissipated, these policies have been maintained or extended, with policymakers citing the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery and the absence of other, equally strong policy levers  -  such as fiscal policy or structural reforms  -  that could replace monetary policy quickly enough.However, several years of ultra-loose monetary policy in the advanced economies has led to significant liquidity spillover abroad, putting excessive upward pressure on higher-yielding developing economies' currencies. With developing countries finding it difficult to deter massive capital inflows or mitigate the effects  -  owing to economic constraints, like high inflation, or to domestic politics  -  the \"currency wars\" metaphor, coined in 2010 by Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega, has resonated widely.\nMoreover, only a small portion of the liquidity created by unconventional monetary policy has been channeled toward households and the small and medium-size enterprises that generate most new jobs. Instead, crisis-affected global financial entities have used it to support their efforts to deleverage and to rebuild their capital, while large corporations have been building large cash reserves and refinancing their debt under favorable conditions. As a result, economic growth and job creation remain lackluster, with the availability of investment finance for long-term productive assets  -  essential to sustainable growth  -  severely limited.Some believe that the elimination of macro-financial tail risks, the gradual strengthening of global economic recovery and the increase in existing asset prices will eventually convince cash hoarders to increase their exposure to new ventures in advanced economies. However, such optimism may not be warranted. In fact, at the recent G20 meeting, the World Bank presented the Umbrella Report on Long-Term Investment Financing for Growth and Development. The report, based on analysis from various international organizations, highlights several areas of concern.For starters, banks' current retrenchment of long-term investment financing is likely to persist. After all, many of the advanced-economy banks, especially in Europe, that dominated such investment  -  for example, financing large-scale infrastructure projects  -  are undergoing deep deleveraging and rebuilding their capital buffers. So far, other banks have been unable to fill the gap."

        "webpage": "Column: The taxing issues that pertain to Obamacare\nBY MICHELE SINGLETARY Columnist Sep 1 2013 12:01 am\nEditor's note: This is the third column in an occasional series from Washington Post financial columnist Michelle Singletary about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.\nMuch has been made of the financial hammer that will fall on people who can afford to pay for health care under the Affordable Care Act but choose to forgo coverage.\nStarting next year, individuals and their dependents are required to have minimum essential health insurance unless they qualify for an exemption. That's why you are hearing so much about the new health care exchanges, which will have open enrollment from Oct. 1 to March 31.\nIf you are deemed to be in the financial position to pay for coverage or you don't fall under an exemption, you'll have to pay a penalty for being uninsured, which you will have to fork over when you file your federal income tax return. The penalty for being uninsured starts at $95 annually for an individual and can go up to $285 for a family, or 1 percent of a family's household income, depending on which is higher. The fee for children is half the adult amount and increases every year. By 2016, the penalty rises to $695 per adult, or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is higher. The amount you may owe is based on the number of months in a given year you go without the required coverage. You won't have to pay if you are uninsured for less than three months of the year.\nA fight over the requirement for coverage landed in the Supreme Court, which ruled that the penalty amounts to a tax. \"The federal government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said in upholding the landmark law. But, he added, the government \"does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance.\" Since the penalty has been judged a tax, it means the Internal Revenue Service is supposed to have the sledgehammer to carry out the mandate.\nHowever, the reality - at least for now - is that the agency only has a soft mallet. The law prohibits the IRS from using its usual tough collection tools to collect any payment you owe related to the individual responsibility provision.\nStill, the IRS may collect your \"shared responsibility payment\" by snatching part or all of your refund depending on what you owe. Additionally, if you fail to pay the penalty, interest will accrue, the IRS says. The interest charged is the same that is imposed for taxes that are paid late. An estimated 6 million people will pay a penalty tax because they are uninsured in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.\nSurely the government will be watching to see if people figure out how to game the system by changing the amount they instruct their employers to withhold from their paychecks, which would result in their not getting a refund.\nIt's through the federal income tax form that you will have to indicate if you have health insurance or are eligible for an exemption. But this doesn't go into effect until you file your 2014 federal return in 2015.\nThe health insurance marketplace will provide certificates of exemption, the IRS says. There are a number of ways to avoid paying a penalty, including coverage through an employer, a veterans' plan, Medicare or Medicaid. If you don't fall into the various categories to avoid a fee, you can still request an exemption. Some individuals may qualify for an exemption on religious grounds or because they have very low income and coverage is considered unaffordable. You won't face a penalty if you are not required to file a tax return because your income is too low.\nThe IRS says information will be made available later about how tax returns will change to allow people to report their health insurance coverage or an exemption. Health insurers will be required to provide everyone that they cover each year with information that will help them demonstrate they have coverage, according to the IRS. So you may have to attach to your tax return a form much like you do now when you include your W-2 or a 1099 that reports other sources of income. If you have more questions about tax issues regarding the ACA, go to . Search for \"Questions and Answers on the Individual Shared Responsibility Provision.\" You can also find answers at .\nAs it is with so much concerning the Affordable Care Act, find out how it affects you especially because now it will be linked to information you provide on your tax return.\nMichelle Singletary is a personal finance columnist for The Washington Post.\nColumn: Food for thought on Obamacare changes\nColumn: With long-term, who will take care of you?\nColumn: Beware of hucksters as Obamacare advances\nColumn: How to sort health care policy fact from fiction\nColumn: Getting ready for next phase of Obamacare"

        "webpage": "SEC Tweet Highlights Its 'Guide' to ICOs\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission highlighted its \"guide to initial coin offerings\" in a Twitter post Sunday. The post linked to a page on the SEC's website that highlights digital assets' \"increased risk of fraud and manipulation\" due to their lack of regulation. Many twitter users were quick to point out the one thing that the \"guide\" doesn't do: namely, offer any real regulatory clarity for ICO issuers or others in the industry.\n\nThe guide offers 5 things that the SEC says everyone needs to know about ICOs. They include the following five statements:\n\nICOs can be securities offerings.\n\nThey may need to be registered.\n\nTokens sold in ICOS can be called many things.\n\nICOs may pose substantial risks.\n\nAsk questions before investing.\n\nUnfortunately, those boilerplate statements are unlikely to provide anyone in the industry with the clarity they need to understand how the SEC views any given project. For example, the first statement is relatively noncommittal and the expanded text for that section offers little additional clarity, simply noting, \"ICOs, based on specific facts, may be securities offerings, and fall under the SEC's jurisdiction of enforcing federal securities laws.\"\n\nLike the rest of the \"guide\" text, however, that explanation raises more questions than it answers since it offers no insight into which \"specific facts\" might cause the SEC to determine that a project should be defined as a securities offering.\n\nThough the guide content has apparently been online for nearly a year, it's noteworthy that it continues to offer little real guidance for the industry - in spite of the fact that ICOs have been on the commission's radar for two years now.\n\nThe text advice for investors is perhaps more illuminating, though its warnings are also relatively generic as well. For example, the SEC advises investors to be aware of the added risk associated with products that can be easily traded internationally. It also recommends that they research the offering's presenter, learn how the product is traded, and exercise caution if an offer sounds like it's \"too good to be true.\"\n\nPerhaps the only thing that the guide truly manages to clarify is that the SEC appears to be unwilling to provide clear guidance, especially when it comes to specific criteria. As observers have noted for some time, the agency seems content to rely on enforcement action to address problems in the industry rather than clarifying the rules and then exercising oversight.\n\nAuthor: Ken Chase\n\nFreelance writer whose interests include topics ranging from technology and finance to politics, fitness, and all things canine.

        "webpage": "What to Do When You Outlive Your Retirement Funds\nWritten by: Seth Fiegerman\n02/21/12 - 9:57 AM EST\nNEW YORK ( MainStreet) -- The idea of retiring comfortably has become the new American dream for many households, but all too often it's a dream that doesn't come true. In what may be the most depressing study to come out in recent memory, researchers from MIT, Dartmouth and Harvard found that nearly half of retirees had less than $10,000 in their retirement savings plans the year before they died and 55% had less than $25,000. To make matters worse, many of these people had no home equity to speak of either. The sad truth about planning for retirement is that too many Americans just don't. The report, published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, reaffirms a point that many financial advisers have been hammering for years: Americans do not set aside nearly enough money and investments to last through their retirement. The result is that many retirees find themselves broke or close to it in their final years. More Headlines Can Airbnb Help Seniors Stay in Their Homes?\n75% of U.S. Workers Say High Student Loan Debt Is Crippling Their Retirement Savings\nCan You Fund Your Retirement With Home Equity?\nThe Retirement Puzzle: How to Live on 60% of Your Income\nWorking After Retirement Is the Newest Trend\nMuch of the reason for this, according to Jean Setzfand, AARP's vice president for Financial Security, is that about half of today's retirees assumed they could rely solely on Social Security as a source of income and so they didn't get into the mindset of saving for retirement. These are most likely the 46% of retirees who passed away with less than $10,000 in savings. The other half, she says, were the ones fortunate to be covered by pensions. Unfortunately, the dynamic may not be much better for those who have yet to retire. \"Only about half of workers are covered by employers from a retirement benefits standpoint. That hasn't changed,\" Setzfand says. What has changed, she says, is that those retirement programs are now more employee-driven (meaning 401(k)s) rather than employer-driven (meaning pensions). \"I'm not sure that we are in a better position. If you look at the numbers on how much people have saved for themselves - the numbers aren't great.\" Indeed, one survey put out by Wells Fargo (WFC) last year found that 29% of workers in their 60s had saved up less than $25,000 for their retirement even though they expected that money would have to hold them over for more than two decades. When you combine those anemic savings with the fact that people are living longer and the ever-increasing cost of prescription drugs and treatments, it's little surprise that so many would come close to running out of money later in life. There are plenty of steps workers can take to prevent this from happening before you retire, as several financial planners we spoke with were quick to point out. These include everything from re-allocating some of your funds into riskier investments, working a few extra years if your health permits and delaying collecting your Social Security benefits until you're closer to 70. 123"

        "webpage": "Debt ceiling may collide with fiscal cliff By Jeanne Sahadi @CNNMoney Congress will need to raise the debt ceiling, currently set at $16.394 trillion, early next year, the Treasury Department says. If Congress fails to cut a deal on the fiscal cliff this year, the scramble to do so in January could run smack dab into yet another high-stakes negotiation -- over raising the debt ceiling. As of late last week, the country's debt was $154 billion below the $16.394 trillion debt ceiling. The Treasury Department expects to hit the legal borrowing limit by the end of this year. But it says it can stave off the risk of default until sometime in early 2013 through the use of \"extraordinary measures,\" such as temporarily suspending investment in federal worker pensions. Of course, lawmakers could eliminate any risk of a collision between the fiscal cliff negotiations and hitting the debt ceiling if they simply decide to raise the debt limit before the year is out. Recent precedent suggests that's a long shot, however. Congress last voted to raise the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011, and it was ugly. The increase was preceded by a destructive game of political brinksmanship. Some Republican lawmakers, bent on extracting spending cuts greater than the debt limit increase, publicly flirted with the idea of letting the country default. Related: What's in the fiscal cliff In the end, the debt ceiling was raised but the episode earned the United States its first-ever credit downgrade and rocked markets. Last year's debt ceiling fight also yielded what's known as the sequester -- close to $1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts starting in January 2013 that everyone wants to replace but can't agree on how. Republicans have again drawn a line in the sand on the debt ceiling. In May, House Speaker John Boehner said they will continue to insist that any further increase in the borrowing limit be exceeded by spending cuts and reforms. Greenspan: Repeal the debt ceiling Of course, it's possible a deal to replace the fiscal cliff will include such reforms along with an agreement to raise the debt ceiling. \"I cannot imagine [President] Obama would agree to any deal that did not include a lengthy extension of the debt limit, ideally with a broader fix to keep the hostage taking from occurring again,\" said congressional scholar Norman Ornstein. But it remains to be seen if Congress will handle the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling in one fell swoop. Budget expert Stan Collender can envision a scenario in which Republicans make fiscal cliff concessions -- say, accept a deal that raises tax rates on income well above the $250,000 preferred by Democrats -- but then insist that the debt ceiling be addressed separately.

        "webpage": "Michael Gerson: The IRS needs an audit\nComment By Michael Gerson, Washington Post\nBy Michael Gerson, Washington Post\nPosted May. 16, 2013 at 2:35 AM\nSuppose that the Environmental Protection Agency were to admit offhandedly that the fluoridation of water had only modest communist mind-control effects. Or the United Nations were to concede it has been running fleets of black helicopters over American cities, but only in the course of conducting extensive good will tours. The IRS has managed a similar confirmation. For years, tea party and patriot groups have breathlessly alleged that federal bureaucrats were conspiring against the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Then federal bureaucrats conspired to target conservative groups because their tax documents contained the words \"tea party\" or \"patriot,\" and because they were \"educating on the Constitution and Bill of Rights.\"As the scandal has unfolded, the IRS has shown characteristic forthrightness and transparency. In March 2012, the then-commissioner of the IRS, Doug Shulman, assured a congressional committee: \"There's absolutely no targeting.\" But senior officials at the agency, according to a leaked IRS inspector general report, were briefed about the targeting as early as the summer of 2011. Now the agency has backtracked to this position: \"IRS senior leadership was not aware of this level of specific details at the time of the March 2012 hearing.\" It will probably take many further congressional hearings to explore the considerable gap between \"absolutely no targeting\" and \"not aware of this level of specific details.\"The IRS has found few defenders, mainly because it is the IRS. Can you imagine the reception that similar arguments would receive if made to the IRS during an audit? \"I was not aware of this level of specific details when I claimed that I absolutely deserved a massive tax deduction.\" The IRS is granted the level of sympathy that it would display to others. What is most maddening about the IRS response is its complacency. Lois Lerner, in charge of nonprofit vetting at the IRS, has termed the heightened scrutiny of conservative groups \"insensitive.\" When asked why her apology was made during an obscure conference, she responded, \"I don't believe anyone ever asked me that question before.\" This after years of complaints by conservative groups of harassing and improper requests for information, including details of their postings on social networking sites and material on the political ambitions of board members and their families.The practices already admitted by the IRS were not political insensitivity; they were political corruption. They amounted to an intrusive, ideologically targeted federal investigation of an American political movement. And complacency, in this circumstance, is self-indictment. As Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, put it: \"If it had been just a small group of employees, then you would think that the high level IRS supervisors would have rushed to make this public, fired the employees involved, and apologized to the American people and informed Congress. None of that happened in a timely way.\" And perhaps not coincidentally, even the IRS' onset of mild remorse came well after the 2012 election.Page 2 of 2 - I am conspicuously not a libertarian. I believe that government has valid purposes that are more than minimal, and that public service is essentially noble. But most Americans, myself included, become libertarians when a policeman is rude and swaggering during a traffic stop. Give me that badge number. It is precisely because police powers are essential to the public good that abusing them is so offensive. The same holds for overzealous or corrupt TSA agents. And it is doubly true with IRS personnel who misuse their broad and intimidating powers. It is enough to bring out the Samuel Adams in anyone.The temptation to abuse power has deep psychological roots. During the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, some students were randomly assigned as guards in a mock prison, while others were designated as inmates. The exercise had to be stopped after six days because the guards became aggressive and abusive. There are serious risks at the intersection of minimal preparation and disproportionate power. Earlier this month, during his commencement address at Ohio State University, President Obama said: \"Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity. ... They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner. You should reject these voices.\"Now part of his own administration has powerfully amplified those voices. If he expects Americans to reject them, it is his personal responsibility to act decisively in restoring the ruined reputation of the IRS.Michael Gerson's email address is .Washington Post Writers Group"

        "webpage": "Does Financial Literacy Matter?\nNEW YORK (MainStreet)  - Three years ago, Bianca Louis and nine other teenage girls were handed $50,000 and told to invest it in the stock market. The money was real, provided by the ING-Girls Inc. Investment Challenge, a program designed to teach girls like Louis, who attends a New York City high school where most students are economically disadvantaged minorities, about investing and personal finance.\nThis was no purely academic exercise. Louis and her teammates would get to keep two-thirds of any return generated by their investment decisions, made with the help of an adult volunteer, and use it for college.\nAlso see: Financial Football Tackles Financial Literacy\n\"When I found out they were giving us $50,000, I was surprised,\" says Louis, who is now 16 and a high school junior. \"It felt powerful. It brought on a sense of responsibility and had us all serious.\"\nThe program worked pretty well as an investment vehicle. Louis's team churned out a $25,000 gain in the three-year project. That was enough for first place in a competition with other teams and roughly $2,000 apiece for the girls' college funds.\nThe girls also learned a lot about investing, according to Rhonda Mims, president of the New York-based ING Foundation. \"When I'd go over to watch some of the sessions I was impressed how intense they were, but also the language they could use,\" Mims says. \"It also gave them experiences like ringing the closing bell that these girls wouldn't have, and also hopefully opened their eyes.\"\nAlso see: Financial Literacy Summit Addresses Gaps in Understanding\nWhile bell-ringing is nice, a more significant question is whether learning about investing and finance changes the girls' behavior and makes them more effective managers of their personal finances. Louis says it has, a little. \"It's only in the last, like, couple of months,\" she says. \"But I've gotten better at saving my own money.\"\nHow well Louis and her teammates turn knowledge into practice is something the investing challenge hopes to determine. \"I think people need financial education in order to equip themselves with the knowledge to be able to invest,\" Mims says. \"To say whether or not they actually do that takes a lot of data. That's part of this program, to track where these girls end up and determine whether we need to make changes to this.\"\nAs it stands, whether young Americans in general possess significant financial literacy is very much in question. In fact, most studies report they don't. In 2010, researchers from Harvard, Dartmouth and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School writing in The Journal of Consumer Affairs said, \"We found that financial literacy was severely lacking among young adults; only 27% knew about inflation and risk diversification and could do simple interest rate calculations.\"\nThe same academics summarized previous research that found people with low financial literacy were less likely than better-educated sorts to accumulate wealth, invest in stocks, choose low-fee mutual funds and plan for retirement. They were also more likely to get in trouble with debt.\nHowever, as a Purdue University researcher noted in a 2005 report assessing high school and college financial education funded by the U.S. Department of Education, it's not clear whether these effects are caused primarily by what students learn in economics and similar classes. It could be that people who are smarter to begin with -- and who have enough interest in money and finance to get the training -- turn out to be better personal financial managers than the less financially literate.\nIt's tempting to say that, even if training doesn't makes us better personal financial managers, it can't hurt. However, even this isn't clear. One just-published analysis of the effectiveness of counseling for homeowners facing foreclosure found they were more likely to miss payments after counseling. On the other hand, the authors noted, those who got counseling were less likely to lose homes to foreclosure. Bottom line: They recommended foreclosure counseling in any future housing crises.\nHomeownership is far from Bianca Louis's current personal finance issues, which are more concerned with resisting impulse purchases from retailers in her Brooklyn neighborhood. So far, she reports, the ING program may be helping there. \"It gave me control over my own money,\" she says. \"I could say, 'I don't have the money to spend on that item now, so I have to wait.'\"\nAlso see: How Big Brands Are Using Supply Chain Storytelling Show Comments"

        "webpage": "Wednesday's UK strike is just the start\nGuardian, UK, 11/29/11\nTwo million workers are expected to strike this week. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\nThe day of action is a rebuke to an elite that gives money to banks at the expense of the poorWednesday's public sector pensions strike is more than industrial action; it is a national day of rebuke. The dispute represents many things beyond its central purpose of making ministers think again about trying to make public servants pay more, work longer, and receive less. It represents a rebuke to an elite, represented by the Conservative-dominated coalition, which has treated the banks and hedge funds in precisely the opposite way, giving them more to deliver less in lending and investment.It also represents a resurgence of the trade union movement after a long decline for which society has paid a price. As unions have declined we have seen a rise in both inequality and the powerlessness of the poorer.This is an unusual strike in an unusual crisis. The action is unusual because it is popular - far more than Tory class warriors seemed to anticipate. Polling shows at least half the country, and an overwhelming majority of Labour supporters, backing the \"day of action\".The public will put up with the inconvenience because they understand the fairness of the public sector workers' case. I believe they also realise that - like the Occupy movement - it is raising issues about what sort of community we live in, and indeed how much inequality any society can withstand before the very notion of \"society\" starts to fragment.The economic crisis is unusual, too, because it can't be blamed on \"greedy trade unionists\" - a novelty for workers of my generation. Trade unionists protecting their living standards were blamed by the media and the Tories every time the economy went into a slump from the second world war to the 1990s. Then, we were accused of bringing the country to a standstill. That can't happen in 2011 - neoliberal economics and Con-Dem slash-and-burn austerity have done the job anyway, putting Britain back in recession.The crash of 2008 and the continued economic unravelling has nothing to do with the unions. That may not stop the government talking about further laws against unions, or removing remaining protections from people at work. But it is stopping them winning the argument. Trade unions are far from isolated today. Indeed, we got 500,000 people out on to the streets of London to demonstrate for an alternative earlier this year - more than we have done at any time in our history.Last week ministers tried to raise a scare about the alleged cost of the day of action. The fantasy figure they came up with was \u00a3500m. Even were it true, you would have to multiply it 248 times to get to the minimum calculation of the sum taxpayers have lost bailing out the banks: \u00a3124bn. That is why the \"all in it together\" rhetoric has attracted such ridicule. And there is no respect in which it is less true than pension provision. Cabinet members Francis Maude and Eric Pickles can look forward to more than \u00a343,000 a year in retirement at the taxpayers' expense - about \u00a337,000 a year more than the dinner ladies they are now asking to pay more to get less. For those striking it is a very different picture. They are victims of the elite policy of taking money from the taxpayer to give it to the bankers and then plugging the budget gap at the expense of some of the poorest.Let me offer a few examples from members of Unite. A worker for the Ministry of Defence with 20 years of public service will have to start paying \u00a3870 extra a year for his pension, which is to be cut by 15%. Graeme, a firefighter from the north-east, will have to find an additional \u00a379 a month not just until he is 60, as hitherto, but until he is 67. \"Do you want a 67-year-old fireman coming to your rescue? Me neither,\" he says.Carole, working for a local authority in Lincolnshire, will be on strike because \"my apparently gold-plated pension will be \u00a36,000 per year\". She warns that if the government makes the scheme unaffordable, \"people will walk away from it and it will fold\".With stories like this, one further thing is certain regarding Wednesday's strike. It is a beginning, not an end, unless the government starts negotiating seriously. There will be more action, more turbulence - including civil disobedience from the expanding coalition of resistance which Unite supports.The government of Goldman Sachs is getting a grip on one European country after another. On Wednesday we will get a glimpse of an alternative - not on paper or a petition, but when millions stand up for themselves.\nNationwideNews"

Yep, that's a recession.Note, this isn't a huge plunge. It's a little toe-dip. But the implications are bigger. Before Prime Minister David Cameron came into power, his country was recovering at roughly the same pace as the U.S. Since Cameron announced an austerity plan to win the graces of the international lending community, the economy has hit a wall, stumbled forward, and finally fallen flat on its face. Take a look at this great graph from Scotty Barber at Reuters: Great Britain is now doing even worse than the euro zone it so routinely disparages.What's the lesson here? That fiscal austerity doesn't work without an export recovery to make up the money? Sure. That the Bank of England has failed to stimulate growth expectations in a sagging economy? Sure.But here's the fascinating thing about the UK double-dip. According to UK Office for National Statistics, the sector whose value-added has grown the most in Great Britain since 2008 is ... the government. Huh?The government supersector -- which includes public administration, defense, education, health, social work, and (for some reason) the \"entertainment and recreation\" industry -- has expanded 4.5% since 2008. By contrast, overall production -- which includes mining, agriculture, and manufacturing -- has declined 9%. Construction, which plummeted in 2009, is still down about 6% from 2008. Meanwhile, despite taking an enormous hit in its mighty financial sector, UK business/finance is nearly back to its 2008 level. Take a  is all this possible? How could austerity be crushing the UK economy while, at the same time, government's value added is growing faster than the rest of the economy?Here's a two-part answer. Part One: The incidence of austerity is having its biggest impact on Britain's disposable income. Reduced transfer payments and higher taxes both count as austerity, but they are squeezing families more than they are squeezing public spending on health care, education, transportation, and defense. As a result, the UK is feeling the pinch of austerity throughout the economy, not just in the sectors conservative consider \"public.\" Part Two: Britain's biggest problem is the EU. The rest of Europe accounts for half of UK exports, and it's been ravaged by the last four years. \"What you engage in medium-term budget consolidation while your biggest trading partners are going into a recession, you shouldn't be surprised that the economy is stalling,\" said Desmond Lachman of the American Enterprise Institute. Austerity or no, the reason why overall production, including manufacturing, and other tradable services are getting crushed is that Britain's trading partners are, well,\ngetting crushed.Update: There's been some confusion over the second graph showing government's value-added component of GDP growing since 2010 even though the British government has been cutting fiercely and shedding 6% of the public workforce. The thing to keep in mind is that much of the UK government -- and much of our government for that matter -- consists of transfer payments for goods and services, and the impact of these cuts is felt in other industries, such as leisure, where demand has fallen. Simon Johnson, the MIT economist and prodigious author, explained over the phone this afternoon: \"Government purchases are more or less stable. The government doesn't drop its purchases dramatically like the private sector. If you include education, or the military's multi-year contracts, or severance packages to laid-off public workers, those things prop up government spending.\"So! The short answer to the question in the headline is: (1) The UK is double-dipping because government cuts are depressing disposable income growth the short run and (2) Austerity works when a small country can export its way out of pain, and the UK's top export partners are falling into recession."

        "webpage": "US debt could trigger dollar collapse, UN warns\nThe United States dollar is facing imminent collapse in the face of an unsustainable debt, the United Nations warned today.\nUnited States debt, which had now deepened to well over $3 trillion, might turn out to be unsustainable in the rest of 2007 or next, putting further downward pressure on the United States dollar, Rob Vos, the Director of the Development Policy and Analysis Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), told correspondents at a Headquarters press conference.\nHe pointed out that since its peak in 2002, the dollar had depreciated vis-\ufffd-vis the major currencies by some 35 per cent and by 25 per cent against a broader range of other currencies.\nVos made these comments at the launch of the 2007 World Economic Situation and Prospects report midyear update.\nWith that increased debt the risk of a sharp depreciation of the dollar continued, he warned. If countries willing to invest in United States dollar assets expected further depreciation, they might be less willing to hold dollar assets, triggering a much sharper fall in the United States dollar. The risk of disorderly adjustment and the steep fall of the dollar existed. The policy challenge was how to prevent a hard landing of the United States dollar and forge a benign adjustment of the global imbalance.\nIn terms of the United States housing sector, he noted that a recession in the housing sector had continued in 2007, with a slowdown in activity and a large number of unsold homes. While house prices had not fallen, that might happen in the months and years to come if the recession continued as expected. A decline in prices would affect the domestic market, particularly household consumption in the United States, resulting in the risk of a serious recession in its economy, slowing growth from 2.1 per cent to 0.5 per cent in 2007 and 2008. That would then significantly slow the world economy and transmit the recession into the rest of the world.\nThe United States deficit had increased to $860 billion at the end of 2006, and was expected to fall to $800 billion in 2007. That deficit was basically being financed by surpluses in the developing and oil exporting countries, as well as some major developed countries, in particular Japan and Germany. The European Union,at large, was projected to continue to have a slight deficit on its current account.\nContinuing, he said the current tendency in macroeconomic policy was not all in the right direction, particularly in the surplus countries where there had been a tightening of monetary and fiscal policies, particularly in Germany and Japan, making it more difficult for the United States to lower its external deficits by export growth. The United States would also need to adopt some contractionary policies to slow down its deficit, he recommended.\n\nThe UN warns:\n\nSomething's in the works to trigger a Poliice State\nFED Witness: Federal Reserve Note is not a dollar but a silver dollar minted since 1986 AD is a real\nThe Coming Collapse of the Dollar\nIran Will Trigger World War 3\nBikermice\nmobile phine detonation has become the trigger of choice\nShannow"

The Charleston Daily Mail () reports property owners received $87 million in insurance payments.\nInsurers also paid out about 4,000 claims totaling more than $15.4 million following Superstorm Sandy last October.\nFormer state Insurance Commissioner Jane Cline analyzed the derecho claim data. She said it hasn't shown any significant increase in companies terminating homeowner coverage following the storm.\nShe also said insurance rates have remained relatively stable. Most post-storm increases were in the 3 percent range.\n\"That's relatively small when you think about the overall dollar amount that was paid out as a result of these claims,\" she said.\nCline, currently the director of public policy for the Charleston law firm Spilman Thomas and Battle, said changes made by the Legislature in the past decade helped keep automobile and homeowner insurance rates from skyrocketing after the derecho.\n\"It's a much more stabilized marketplace than it was in early 2000s,\" Cline said.\nWest Virginia had been one of six states that permitted third-party bad-faith lawsuits that allege insurers had not addressed a claim reasonably. In 2005, then-Gov. Joe Manchin led an effort to curtail those lawsuits, moving the complaints under the review of the insurance commissioner's office.\nThe result replaced windfall jury awards to individuals with more reasonable amounts, Cline said. It also helped regulators to quickly identify and correct any bad insurance market practices.\n\"All the reforms and changes that have occurred in the marketplace and the regulatory structure have worked,\" she said. \"And as a result of that, in these disasters you're not seeing the increased rates and cancellations of policies.\"\nAcross the state, the derecho and subsequent storms left three people dead and more than 680,000 customers without electricity. Sandy was blamed for seven deaths, dumped up to 19 inches of snow, closed dozens of roads, toppled roofs and left about 268,000 customers in the dark.\nCline said property owners should review their policies before disasters occur so they know what's covered and maintain an inventory of appliances and high-value items in their homes.\n\"We used to say get smart about insurance  -  understand what your coverage needs are,\" she said. \"Don't wait until the time you need to file a claim to figure out what you have in place.\""

It shows that policymakers' concerns about the global economy have only grown,\" Mark Williams, an economist at Capital Economics in London, said of the People's Bank of China's action.\nA raft of Chinese data is due next week, including second-quarter gross domestic product that officials may know to be poor, he said. But they may also be trying to foster suggestions of acting in concert.\n\"Policymakers may have felt that cutting rates on the day that the ECB (did) the same would deliver a bigger impact, encouraging talk of a coordinated response to the slowdown in the global economy,\" Williams said. \"Again, though, this might simply underline the seriousness of the downside risks.\"\nIn Frankfurt, ECB President Mario Draghi denied any globally coordinated central bank action of the sort seen after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.\n\"On coordination, no, there wasn't any ... that went beyond the normal exchange of views on the state of the business cycle, on the state of the economy, and on the state of global demand,\" he told a news conference.\nAsked if conditions were now as bad as they were in late 2008 when the world's financial system was teetering, Draghi replied: \"Definitely not.\"\nThe action puts even more focus on what the U.S. Federal Reserve will do when it holds its next meeting on July 31 and Aug. 1.

The Effects of Trade Procedure Harmonization (Short version) 1\nYves Bourdet 2 and Maria Persson 3\n> Have your say\nThe successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations have contributed to lowering the levels of the European Union's customs duties to historically low levels. In addition, most quantitative trade restrictions have been removed. The trade impeding effect of other non-tariff barriers, like technical standards, has also been reduced, partly as a result of the completion of the European single market. There remain, however, trade obstacles of a more administrative nature, commonly named trade procedures. The dismantlement or reduction of traditional trade barriers has given these trade procedures a prominent role in the current Doha Round negotiations. The first objective of this paper was to point out that the EU does not have a harmonized practice when it comes to trade procedures. Measuring the effectiveness of cross-border trade procedures by the time delays that they cause, we have illustrated that these delays vary considerably within the EU. In fact, they go from merely 5 days in the most efficient countries to 25 days in some others. We therefore draw the conclusion that, despite the fact that the EU formally is a customs union, countries in the rest of the world face different trade barriers depending on which EU country they ship their goods to.\nThe second aim of the paper was to investigate whether these differences in applied trade procedures matter in practice. The time delays caused by trade procedures do indeed have a significantly negative effect on trade volumes. Using a gravity model, we found that a one-percent increase in border delays would on average lead to export volumes being diminished by 0.44 percent. To put this result into an economic perspective, we have also used these figures to illustrate how much trade volumes would change if trade procedures were harmonized across EU countries. We found that harmonization could have substantial trade effects, but also that the levels at which countries converge is critical. If all countries applied import procedures at the level of the currently most efficient EU countries, the average non-member would increase its aggregated exports to the EU by around 20 percent. On the other hand, in a scenario with only partial harmonization where the countries with time delays above the average reduce their time delays to that average while the others do not reform, aggregated exports from outside countries are expected to increase by merely 3 percent on average. In a \"worst-case\" scenario where countries harmonize trade procedures to the level of the currently least efficient countries  -  in other words a scenario involving the creation of very much higher trade barriers in many countries  -  aggregated exports from the average country in the rest of the world would decrease by as much as 68 percent. What are the policy implications of our results? Well, if the EU wants to live up to being a fully-fledged customs union, arguably, there is reason to consider harmonization of the import procedures as they appear in practice. Since the \"worst-case\" scenario of a harmonization at the least efficient level hardly seems like a desirable outcome, harmonization coupled with substantial liberalization is certainly the scenario which to most analysts would appear the most beneficial.

        "webpage": "Survey: Americans felt more secure in jobs in 2012\nCHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER,AP Economics Writer\nWASHINGTON (AP)  -  Confidence in the U.S. job market has rebounded to roughly a normal level from its record low after the Great Recession, a trend that could help boost the economy.\nAmericans increasingly feel they could find a new job if necessary, according to the results of the 2012 General Social Survey, a long-standing poll of public opinion. And fear of being laid off dropped last year from its 2010 peak to roughly its average for the 35 years the question has been asked.The percentage of Americans who said it would be somewhat or very easy to find a job if they lost theirs rose to 54 percent last year from 46 percent in 2010. The 2010 figure was the lowest since 1983, when the United States was also emerging from a deep recession. On average in the survey's history, about 58 percent of respondents have said it would be very or somewhat easy to find a job.As layoffs have declined, fewer Americans fear losing their job. Last year, 11 percent of adults thought it was somewhat or very likely that they'd lose theirs. That was down from a record-high 16 percent in 2010. And it matches the 11 percent average the survey has found since it began asking the question.Americans may be feeling even more secure now than when the survey was taken last year. The number of layoffs fell in January to the lowest level in the 12 years the government has tracked the data. Fewer people are seeking unemployment benefits.And employers have stepped up hiring, though the job gains slowed in March. Employers added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012, an average of about 180,000 a month. That's enough to slowly lower the unemployment rate.Even though the rate remains high at 7.6 percent, greater confidence among those who have a job could encourage more consumer spending and boost economic growth.\"If you're not afraid of being laid off, you're going to spend more of your money,\" said Drew Matus, an economist at UBS.The General Social Survey has been conducted roughly every two years since 1972. The survey is a project of the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, with primary funding from the National Science Foundation.From mid-March through September last year, 1,975 adults were asked about their financial situation and their feelings about the job market. The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. The results were only recently made available.The survey found that confidence in the economy varied by education. Those with college degrees felt more job security than those with less education. And since the recession ended in June 2009, Americans with a college education have reported greater improvement in confidence than have those with high school degrees or less.Only 6 percent of college-educated Americans said in 2012 that it was somewhat or very likely that they'd lose their job. That was down from 10 percent in 2010.Those with high school degrees were also more confident in 2012: Twelve percent of this group feared losing their job, down from 19 percent two years earlier.But Americans with less than a high school degree reported little change: 26 percent felt it was somewhat or very likely they would be laid off in 2012, about on par with the 29 percent who felt so in 2010.On whether it would be somewhat or very easy to find another job, 59 percent of those with college degrees said so, up from 52 percent in 2010. Among high school graduates, that figure rose to 53 percent last year from 43 percent in 2010.Those without a high school degree still lack confidence: Only 40 percent said it would be somewhat or very easy to find new work, essentially unchanged from the 41 percent who said so in 2010.Among the survey's other findings: -  Fewer Americans say their financial situation has worsened in the past few years, though the proportion remains high. A record 37 percent of Americans in 2010 said their finances had deteriorated. In 2012, that figure fell to 30 percent, still the second-highest on record. -  More Americans define themselves as in the \"lower class\" than at any time since 1972. A record 8 percent classified themselves as lower class in 2012, the same as in 2010. That compares with the record low of 4 percent in 1985. -  The proportion of Americans who expect their children to be somewhat or much worse off financially than they are was 20 percent in 2012, compared with 18 percent in 2010. The figure is slightly below the record level of 22 percent in 1996."

His rousing speech at the Democrats' convention told the delegates that Republicans \"want to go back to the same old policies that got us into trouble in the first place.\"\nThat is world class brass. Bill Clinton's own administration, more than any other, promoted an unsustainable housing boom, which eventually and inevitably led to a housing bust that brought down the whole American economy.\nBehind all the complex financial processes that reached to Wall Street and beyond, there is one fundamental fact: many people stopped making their mortgage payments.\nWhy did that happen? Because mortgage loans were made to people who did not meet the long-established qualification standards for getting a mortgage loan. And why did that happen? Because the Clinton administration threatened lawsuits against lenders who did not approve mortgage loans to minority applicants as often as to white applicants.\nIn other words, racial quotas replaced credit qualifications. A failure to have racial statistics on mortgage approvals that fit the government's preconceptions was equated with discrimination.\nAttorney General Reno said that lenders who \"closely examine their lending practices and make necessary changes to eliminate discrimination\" would \"fare better in this department's stepped-up enforcement effort than those who do not.\" She said: \"Do not wait for the Justice Department to come knocking.\"\nClinton's Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) had similar racial quota policies, and began taking legal actions against banks that turned down more minority applicants than HUD thought they should.\nHUD said that it was breaking down \"racial and ethnic barriers\" so as to create more \"access\" to home ownership. It established \"goals\"  -  political Newspeak for quotas  -  for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy mortgages that the original lenders had made to \"the underserved population.\" In other words, the original lenders could pass on the increasingly risky mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  -  and, ultimately, to the taxpayers.\nOther federal agencies warned mortgage lenders against having credit standards that these agencies considered too high. And these agencies had many powers to use against banks and other lenders who did not heed their warnings.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, for example, issued guidelines for \"non-discriminatory\" lending which warned lenders against \"unreasonable measures of creditworthiness.\" Lenders should have standards \"appropriate to the economic culture of urban lower-income and nontraditional consumers\" and consider \"extenuating circumstances.\" In other words, when some people don't come up to the lending standards, then the lending standards should be brought down to them.\nWhat was the evidence for all the lending discrimination that the government was supposedly trying to prevent? Statistics.\nIn the year 2000, for example, black applicants for conventional mortgage loans were turned down at twice the rate for white applicants. Case closed, as far as the media and the government were concerned. Had they bothered to look a little deeper, they would have found that whites were turned down at nearly twice the rate for Asian Americans.\nHad they bothered to check out average credit scores, they would have discovered that whites had higher average credit scores than blacks, and Asian Americans had higher average credit scores than whites.\nSuch inconvenient facts would have undermined the whole moral melodrama, reducing it to a case of plain economics, with lenders more likely to lend to those who were more likely to pay them back. Once lending standards were lowered, in order to meet racial quotas, they were lowered for everybody. Deadbeats of any race could get mortgage loans, and most were probably not minorities.\nDemocrats like to blame the \"greed\" of business, rather than the policies of government, for problems. But lenders don't make money by lending to individuals who don't pay them back. That is what government forced lenders to do, beginning under the Clinton administration. And the eventual collapse took down the economy.\nIt takes brass to defy the facts. And Bill Clinton has brass.\nThomas Sowell is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.

A total of 1,032 in Mesa County are receiving the same compensation.\nFederal money for those payments would dry up at the end of the year if no deal is reached, Tuffin said.\nAs of October, 39,000 applicants are receiving unemployment compensation and their benefits will expire in five weeks, she said.\nMesa County's 1,032 recipients of unemployment compensation is well below the high for the year of 1,553 in February.\n\"We are at least going in the right direction,\" Tuffin said.\nThe approach of the fiscal cliff has few direct implications for health care, said Steve ErkenBrack, president and CEO of Rocky Mountain Health Plans, but any slowdown in the economy could increase cost shifting and slow the implementation of Obama's health care law.\nIt's important to reach a resolution because \"uncertainty is rarely good for a stable health care system,\" ErkenBrack said.\nHouse Republicans remain insistent on budget cuts before looking to increase taxes, while Obama is calling for an extension of the current tax structure for all but the nation's highest earners, households with more than $250,000 in income and individuals with more than $200,000.\nThose taxpayers would see their marginal income tax rates increase from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, as well as see increased rates on capital gains and inheritance taxes.\nU.S. Rep. Scott Tipton, R-Colo., wants to know where and how additional revenue from higher taxation would be spent, and how it would reduce spending, his office said.\nU.S. Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., said he was worried that some members of Congress were eager to drive the nation \"over the fiscal cliff and back into a recession than work toward a compromise.\"\nUdall said he would work for a responsible solution to the fiscal cliff and said the issue boils down to \"whether Congress has the political courage to choose what's best for the country over rigid pledges and sacred cows.\"\nIt's important to give the president and congressional negotiators space, U.S. Sen.

Really? By doing what?\" 38-year-old Astrid Mabiana, a mother of three who has been unemployed for most of the past four years, asked of Hollande's job pledge as she left an employment agency a few days ago.\nUnemployment is expected to increase throughout the year, to hit 11.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 and stand at 11.2 percent for the full year, according to the Reuters poll of 12 French and international economists.\n\"It's really tough and it will get even tougher. With the crisis all there is is people getting fired,\" said 37 year-old Spaniard Juan, who didn't give his family name. After living in France for 10 years and working washing dishes in restaurants, he has been out of work for a year.\nINSEE said that the quarterly unemployment data measured according to International Labour Organisation standards was only an estimate, pointing out to technical difficulties that include new procedures to collect data.\nThe data does not include the small overseas territory of Mayotte or give any of the usual additional information such as a breakdown of the youth unemployment rate, INSEE said.\nAngelos Tsakanikas\nKlimaka"

Bales today.\nJoseph Blimline was sentenced to 240 months in federal prison on each of the charges related to the Ponzi schemes following a five-hour sentencing hearing on May 3, 2012, before U.S. District Judge Marcia A. Crone. Judge Crone ordered the sentences to run concurrently and ordered that restitution be made to the victims of the schemes.\nU.S. Attorney Bales commended the efforts of federal agents and regulators in investigating the complex schemes and cautioned potential investors, \"The Michigan agents worked hand in hand with the agents in Texas and with federal and state securities regulators to untangle both of these complicated Ponzi schemes and bring the perpetrators to justice for their abuse of the trust of others to obtain criminal profits. To all potential investors, I urge you to be wary of investment vehicles that promise exorbitant rates of return. Remember: If the opportunity appears too good to be true, then it probably is.\"\nAt the sentencing hearing, the government presented testimony and evidence which established that Blimline and others began operating a Ponzi scheme in Michigan between November 2003 and December 2005, specifically by promising inflated rates of return in order to obtain payments from investors. Lacking any legitimate source of income with which to make payouts to the investors, Blimline directed that later investor payments be used to pay previous investors and diverted investor payments for his own personal benefit. The Michigan scheme netted more than $28 million from its investor victims before its collapse.\nIn early 2006, Blimline exported the Michigan Ponzi scheme to Texas, where Blimline and his new co-conspirators began the operation of Provident Royalties in Dallas. Consistent with his previous actions in Michigan, Blimline made materially false representations and failed to disclose material facts to their investors in order to induce the investors into providing payments to Provident. Blimline received millions of dollars in unsecured loans from investor funds and also directed the purchase by Provident of worthless assets from his Michigan enterprise. In the Provident scheme, funds from later investors were also consistently used to make payments to early investors, resulting in the collapse of the scheme in 2009. The Provident scheme netted over $400 million from approximately 7,700 investor victims.\nWestern District of Michigan U.S. Attorney Donald A. Davis praised the diligent work and cooperation of all involved and stated, \"Stealing money through fraud and deceit will not be tolerated.\"\nAndrew G. Arena, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Detroit Division, echoed these sentiments, \"This sentencing comes as a result of the hard work performed by agents committed to stopping this type of fraud. Those who choose to steal money through the operation of these schemes will be arrested and brought to justice.\"\nU.S. Postal Inspector-in-Charge E. C. Woodson also highlighted the cooperative efforts of law enforcement, \"The Michigan case is the result of the cooperation between the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and the FBI in protecting the American public. Together we investigated and brought to justice those individuals who attempted to victimize the public. Know that we will continue to supply the resources necessary to investigate arrest and prosecute anyone who would utilize the mail to perpetuate a fraud against the American people.\"\nThis law enforcement action is part of President Barack Obama's Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force.\nPresident Obama established the interagency Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial crimes. The task force includes representatives from a broad range of federal agencies, regulatory authorities, inspectors general, and state and local law enforcement who, working together, bring to bear a powerful array of criminal and civil enforcement resources. The task force is working to improve efforts across the federal executive branch, and with state and local partners, to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes, ensure just and effective punishment for those who perpetrate financial crimes, combat discrimination in the lending and financial markets, and recover proceeds for victims of financial crimes.\nThe Michigan case was investigated by the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler. The Texas case was investigation by the FBI and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Shamoil T. Shipchandler."

        "webpage": "Beware of NDP leadership hopefuls bearing policy gifts from Greece By Gregory Thomas\nweb posted December 5, 2011 In his campaign to become the next national leader of the NDP, candidate Brian Topp is proposing a radical program of huge tax hikes. To understand why a serious contender for the leadership of Canada's official opposition would put forward such a destructive program, it's important to consider his world view.\nWhen the Greek debt crisis was unfolding this past summer, Mr. Topp was at the centre of it all, in Athens, admiring the leadership skills of former Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou.\nTo most of us the summer was frightening; watching Papandreou plunge the world economy into near-chaos - first agreeing to a bailout package from the European Union, then announcing a national referendum on the deal (without consulting the EU or his cabinet), triggering a global stock market sell-off and finally calling off the referendum vote and resigning under pressure. Investors took a 50 per cent loss on Greek bonds, pensioners saw across-the-board reductions in their retirement benefits, while Greek employers and workers prepared for a severe recession.\nFor Topp, then serving as national president of Canada's NDP, it was business as usual.\nIn Athens on Canada Day, for the worldwide convention of Socialist International, he wrote home to his blog , that Papandreou \"is a quietly inspiring figure.\" Topp said the Greek leader \"opened the meeting with a calm, thoughtful, and determined overview.\"\n\"Perhaps his most important words were his final ones,\" Topp wrote, as he thrilled to the uplifting rhetoric. \"We will survive, and we will win.\"\nEverybody knows the next chapter in the story: Papandreou and the NDP's Socialist International counterparts proceeded to default on Greece's debt.\nThis would all be pretty funny if Brian Topp were not the most likely successor to Jack Layton, poised to become the leader of Canada's official opposition.\nIn the current fiscal year, the government of Canada expects to collect record revenues. Even so, finance minister Jim Flaherty is forecasting a $35 billion deficit on account of spending that has soared 31 per cent since his government took office in 2006. And Flaherty is forecasting spending to increase a further 13 per cent over the next five years, before revenues overtake spending and we finally enjoy a balanced budget.\nLike most of his colleagues in Socialist International, Brian Topp believes the solution to the worldwide debt crisis (a crisis caused by over-spending) is higher taxes.\nIn his policy paper released in late November, Brian Topp promises that, as Prime Minister, he will hike the top federal income tax rate from 29 per cent to 35 per cent, double the taxable capital gains rate from 50 to 100 per cent, tax stock options like employment income and boost the federal business tax rate from 15 per cent to 22.12 per cent.\nHe explains his $18 billion tax grab, saying our current tax rates are \"benefits given to people who don't need them.\" Apparently in Mr. Topp's world, any money you earn is rightful property of the government and any amount they let you keep is a gift for which you should be grateful.\nFor now, the people Brian Topp claims to really want to squeeze - 173,570 people earning over $250,000 - (less than the population of Barrie, Ontario) already pay $29 billion dollars in federal income tax each year. Or put another way, they are the 0.7 per cent of all taxpayers who happen to provide 20 per cent of all federal income tax revenue. In comparison, 12 million Canadians (52 per cent of taxpayers) pay $6 billion in federal income taxes - only 4 per cent of the total.\nTopp's solution is to target the people who already pay $29 billion each year in federal income tax and take another $3 billion from them.\nAnd what would he do with that $3 billion tax grab? Topp says the money \"would then be available for productive investment.\"\nMany of us could probably be classed as sceptics on that point: if you needed to find a truly productive investment for that money, you might be tempted to leave it in the hands of the people who earned it, rather than turn it over to the president of the NDP, the former prime minister of Greece and all the big brains in Socialist International.

These analyses are supported with the most up-to-date and comparable data for over 300 indicators covering 32 topics, grouped into eight themes: demographic trends, health, education and knowledge, poverty and insecurity, women's empowerment, environment, economy, and connectivity. Expansion of Global Value Chains in Asian Developing Countries: Automotive Case Study in the Mekong Subregion1 Dec 2013Journals During the past three decades, the development of highly integrated global value chains in which products are supplied, manufactured and distributed across national boundaries have created a new form of division of labour among Asian economies, especially in North-East and South-East Asia. The rapid growth of global value chains has dramatically changed production patterns, international trade and foreign direct investment in the region, with a notable expansion of intraregional trade through multiple border crossings of parts and components. Shifting from quantity to quality: Growth with equality, efficiency, sustainability and dynamism1 Dec 2013Flagship publications and book series Conventional growth strategies have reduced poverty. People now have more access to basic services and more opportunities for mobility and participation. But there are still persistent unmet needs, widening inequalities, and new development challenges such as climate change, intensifying natural disaster and resource depletion. There is a search for growth strategies that better fit a changing economic, social and environmental reality. Technical paper: Sound Practices in Space Technology Applications for Disaster Risk Reduction and Inclusive and Sustainable Development26 Nov 2013Journals Asia-Pacific is the most disaster-prone region of the world. In recent years, it has faced a series of multiple exogenous shocks that transcend geographical boundaries and endanger our communities. The poor and the vulnerable are the ones most affected. Despite the rapid economic growth in the region, many developing countries are increasingly vulnerable to disasters, and the magnitude and frequency of extreme disasters are estimated to rise due to the effects of climate change. This necessitates building resilience of the region to extreme disasters in multidimensional ways. Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2013: Turning the Tide: Towards Inclusive Trade and Development22 Nov 2013Flagship publications and book series The present document is based on the forthcoming Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2013 (henceforth the Report), which is the main substantive document prepared for the third session of the Committee on Trade and Investment. The Report comprises two parts. In the first part, there is a focus on trends and developments in trade in merchandise and commercial services, foreign direct investment flows, performance in trade facilitation, and reliance on preferential policies and trade agreements from an Asia-Pacific perspective. Asia-Pacific Population Journal Volume 2821 Nov 2013JournalsAsia-Pacific Population Journal Volume 28 was released in 2013. A Decade of Building Regional Co-operation in Trade and Investment20 Nov 2013Books ESCAP focuses on a number of areas of economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific. One of these is trade and investment - a vital engine for growth and integration. Recent decades have seen an enormous expansion in trade and investment flows in the Asia-Pacific region. Regional economies are increasingly part of global value chains. This has helped foster the economic dynamism that has lifted many from poverty and spread prosperity more widely. At the same time, however, too many individuals and communities remain excluded from the benefits of trade and investment. Review of Developments in Transport in Asia and the Pacific 20137 Nov 2013Flagship publications and book series While transport has been an essential element in the rapid growth and economic development of Asia and the Pacific, the sector is now at a crossroads more than ever before. Rocketing demand for transport services is putting extreme pressure on existing infrastructure at a time when public budgets are constrained and awareness about the negative externalities of transport activities is growing. The challenge is therefore to ensure that today's transport policies and investments will contribute to a sustainable and inclusive development path for the future. Dealing with challenges for making trade inclusive 1 Nov 2013Working paper series Trade has the potential to contribute to economic growth and to more and better jobs. Whether trade contributes to growth that is inclusive, in the sense that all people can contribute to and benefit from growth triggered by trade, is likely to depend on country specificities including institutional pre-conditions and policies applied in domains other than trade. This paper identifies specific challenges for making trade inclusive and identifies ways for dealing with them.\nThe Vanuatu Cocoa Growers' Association: Inclusive Trade in Rural Smallholder Agriculture 1 Nov 2013Working paper series The Cocoa Grower's Association (CGA) in the Republic of Vanuatu is a fundamental example of how the organization of local cooperatives can make a significant impact and create an environment for inclusive trade. This paper will review a case study of implementing a governing association that coordinates cocoa cooperatives in Vanuatu, and which is focused on organizing the production and trade in the region, as a method to highlight key lessons learned and potential for scalability in furthering inclusive trade goals.

Surveys Offer Differing Views on U.S. Job Gains Drop in September unemployment rate looks healthier than 114,000 increase in payrolls.\nBy Lorraine Woellert, Bloomberg October 5, 2012 \u2022 Reprints\nDepending on which Labor Department survey is used, employment in the U.S. either surged the most in 29 years or grew the least in three months.\nEmployers added 114,000 workers to payrolls last month, the fewest since June, according to the Labor Department's survey of employers released in Washington today. A separate poll of households showed hiring surged by 873,000, the biggest gain since June 1983 excluding annual Census population adjustments. The surge helped push down the jobless rate to 7.8 percent, the lowest since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009.\nAveraging the job gains of the two surveys helps produce a more consistent view of the labor market as Americans prepare to head to the polls to choose between Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The unexpected drop in the jobless rate prompted former General Electric Co. head Jack Welch to accuse the White House of manipulating the data.\n\"The two surveys tell you generally the same thing,\" said Michael Gapen, senior U.S. economist in New York for Barclays Plc. \"These numbers are consistent with what we've generated on average. This suggests the labor market has normalized after a pretty volatile spring and summer.\"\nPayrolls grew by 146,000 on average from July through September, while the household survey showed employment climbed by 186,000, the data showed.\nThe jobless rate is derived from a survey of about 60,000 households that is conducted by the Census Bureau and includes groups like the self-employed and agricultural workers that are not captured by the payroll figures. The latter is calculated based on a Labor Department survey of almost 500,000 worksites.\nAfter adjusting the data to make it comparable to the payroll count, the household figures showed a 294,000 gain in hiring in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOver time these surveys show a very similar development in the labor market, said Kevin Logan, chief economist at HSBC Securities USA Inc. in New York.\n\"Even if the sample jumps around each month as long as everything is jumping the same way, then you're actually getting a pretty accurate measure with you ratios,\" Logan said. \"So then it's probably the case that the unemployment rate is trending down, but I don't think we're going to see 0.3 percent every month.\"\nThe household survey may be more accurate at turning points in the economy because it is more likely to pick up hiring and firing at small companies and new firms that may be under the government's radar. Yet the benefits of that real-time information are offset by the fact that the survey is much smaller and the results are therefore more volatile than the establishment figures, according to Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York."

A very candid, very direct dialogue with the American people about the fundamental issues and the fundamental choices we face as a country.\nWhat are the options for reforming Social Security? What are the options for reforming Medicare? What are the options for strengthening our educational system - dramatically strengthening it, which it needs. What are the options for reducing our dependence on imported oil? What are the options for ensuring that there's sufficient funds available to protect us and fight the war on terror?\nThe problem is that this administration [i.e. the George W. Bush administration] and many members of Congress have not been willing to take on these tough issues. They've created the impression that you can do these things on the cheap. For instance, you can't finance the military through backdoor spending or supplementals; that you really don't need to make tough choices among national priorities; that you can promise things for the future and let someone else deal with them five, ten years down the road.\nAnd therefore candor is, I think, the most important thing for the president; the new president to exhibit.\nAnd the second is that we have to understand what it takes to compete in this new world economy, and also what it takes to ensure that a sizeable number of Americans do not feel left behind by new technologies, by new productivity enhancing devices, by globalization.\nToo many people feel that new technology is a threat to them; that new changes in the global system - globalization of trade and investment - are harmful to them or disruptive of their lives; that they can't compete in that environment, then we're going to have a fractured economy.\nThen we're going to have a very corrosive political and social system where one group of people sees itself as benefiting enormously from technical progress, from globalization; and another group sees these things as enormous threats.\nAnd that leads to the question of a widening income gap. That also in this country can be very corrosive of our system.\nAnd third, if people don't have the sense that there's upward mobility, many of them will feel that the system is blocked for them; that they simply can't adjust to these changes and they will become very, very unhappy. But more than unhappy, they'll be working against the kinds of technical change which the overall economy needs to maintain its edge.\nSo people have to be brought into the process. They have to see the process of change as beneficial to them, and not see it as antithetical to their interests.\nRecorded On: July 25, 2007\nMore ideas from Robert Hormats\nWhat makes a great leader?\nWhat is your outlook?\nAmerican Business Today\nby Robert Hormats\nJanuary 6, 2008, 12:21 PM\nThe American people need more candor, Hormats says.\nThe U.S. Government's Role ..."

It is also higher than the national average of 6.2 percent.\n\nAnd the state had fewer jobs in 2014, at 1,667,400, than it did in 1989, when there were 1,678,900 nonfarm jobs.\n\nBut that's turning around more quickly than the report seems to give it credit for, said Joseph Carbone, president and CEO of The Workplace Inc.\n\nCarbone, who had yet to read the full report, said job growth can be seen each month in the state Department of Labor's reports. \"If you look at the last six or eight months, we have had growth nearly every month,\" he said.\n\nJust this June, the state report noted increases in the number of jobs in seven of 11 sectors of the Connecticut economy, he said. \"It's not as robust as we would like it to be, but it's steady,\" Carbone said.\n\nHe estimated the state would recover and surpass its pre-recession job levels in two years or less.\n\nConnecticut Voices also said young workers, minorities and those less educated are disproportionately affected because their unemployment rates were already high going into the recession.\n\n\"We're seeing more than just a five-year downturn here in Connecticut,\" Gibson said. \"We're looking at a decade or more where Connecticut families have not seen their finances improve.\"\n\nThis, the child advocacy group noted, means that children in those families are also being adversely affected.\n\nIn its report, Connecticut Voices provides suggestions for actions the state government can take to move in the right direction, including expanding the earned income tax credit to the full 30 percent of the federal credit -- a move that is already scheduled. \"State budgets are uncertain things so we want to make sure the expansion that is scheduled in fact occurs,\" Gibson said.\n\nNow Playing:\n\nAnother proposed change to the tax code is the addition of a tax exemption that would take into consideration the cost of raising children. Connecticut Voices also proposes the expansion of access to high-quality early care and education and high-performing K-12 schools."

Risky Business\nUpdated map shows threats of terrorism and political violence are easing in the West, but the world remains a dangerous place.\nBy Treasury & Risk Staff January 28, 2014 \u2022 Reprints\nAon Risk Solutions has issued its interactive 2014 Terrorism and Political Violence Map. Mousing over the map reveals a rating for each country, on a scale of 1 to 5, of the overall level of risk from terrorism and political violence to businesses operating within its borders. Users can also view ratings of business risk broken into subcategories: terrorism and sabotage; riots, strikes, civil commotion, and malicious damage to property; and insurrection, revolution, rebellion, mutiny, coup d'etat, civil war, and war. Aon developed the ratings jointly with the Risk Advisory Group plc.\nCompared with last year's ratings, this year Aon gave reduced risk scores to 34 countries and gave increased risk scores to only four: Brazil, Japan, Mozambique, and Bangladesh. Brazil's rating rose from medium in 2013 to severe in 2014 because of last year's large-scale and violent anti-government protests, which Aon expects to continue. Japan's risk increased from negligible to low because of increased geopolitical tensions and the nation's rising military spending.\nNot surprisingly, the Middle East and Africa remain the areas where businesses face the highest risks. One-third of all countries that received \"high\" or \"severe\" risk scores are in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the map does not include breakdowns by industry sector, Aon reports that retail and transportation are the sectors most at risk. Last year, 33 percent of terrorist attacks hit the retail sector, while 18 percent affected transportation.\n\"The map shows that having the means to understand and stay ahead of terrorism threats and political violence risks has never been more important,\" says Henry Wilkinson, head of the Intelligence and Analysis practice at Risk Advisory. \"Despite signs of global economic recovery, businesses in emerging markets are as exposed as ever to a diversifying array of risk"

        "webpage": "[SMH | Text-only index] Employment numbers game is not so simple\nRoss Gittins\nWORKING out what's happening in the jobs market is trickier than you may think - and has just got trickier. On the face of it, this week's figures from the Bureau of Statistics are simple: they show employment grew by a bit more than 10,000 last month and the rate of unemployment was steady at 5.4 per cent.\nBut it's not that simple. The rate at which people of working age participated in the labour force (either by holding a job or actively seeking one) fell from 65.1 per cent to 65 per cent of the labour force.\nAt times like these, with the growth in employment slowing and the number of job vacancies falling, a decline in the participation rate is usually taken as a sign the number of ''discouraged jobseekers'' is rising. These are people who'd like to work but who, believing there are no jobs available, have stopped actively seeking one, meaning they're no longer counted as unemployed.\nSo, many economists would take the fall in the participation rate last month to mean the jobs market deteriorated despite the unchanged rate of unemployment.\nBut if we want to play this game we should really start two years ago, in January 2011, when (using the trend figures) the unemployment rate reached a low of 5 per cent. Since then it's risen only to 5.4 per cent, which doesn't seem much.\nOver the same period, however, the ''part rate'' has fallen from a peak of 65.8 per cent to 65 per cent. Saul Eslake, of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, calculates that had this decline not occurred, all else being equal the unemployment rate in December last year would have been 6.6 per cent, not 5.4 per cent.\nFortunately, however, it's still not that simple. Heard of the ageing of the population? Whereas for decades it was pushing our participation rate up, it's now started pushing it down, meaning it's no longer safe to assume a fall is all the work of discouraged jobseekers.\nThis is an unfamiliar but important story, so settle back for a primer on demography.\nWe are living at a time in the world's long history when longevity is steadily rising (because of improvements in public health, increasing affluence and advances in medical science) but fertility is falling (because of improvements in contraception and rising affluence). A country's ''total fertility rate'' is the average number of children women are projected to bear over their lives.\nAs The Economist magazine has explained, when a country's fertility rate falls sharply, the children born before the fall become ''a sort of generational bulge surging through a society''.\nIn the case of the developed countries, the sharp and continuing fall in fertility was caused by the advent of the contraceptive pill, and the surging generation became known as the baby boomers. But something similar happened a few decades later in those developing countries that began developing rapidly. Access to contraception improved, girls became better educated and families decided to have fewer children.\nA country in this situation enjoys a ''demographic dividend''. After a while, the earlier generation becomes old enough to be part of the labour force (they reach the age of 15) and this happens while old people are dying fairly early and fewer babies are being born.\nSo the country enjoys a big improvement in its ''dependency ratio'' - the ratio of"

Music of 2014 NPR : Morning Edition Filed Under: InternationalEconomy\nFaltering Economy Threatens Pakistan's Stability By: Jackie Northam October 4, 2012 comments\nIf you want to gain a good insight into Pakistan's economic situation, just look at a few of the country's newspaper headlines on any given day. The language says it all: prices soar, stocks plunge, budget deficit swells, foreign investment evaporates  -  and the list goes on.\nNow, analysts are increasingly worried that the faltering economy could join Pakistan's pervasive insurgency and repeated political upheavals as another serious threat to the country's stability.\nA recent report issued at the World Economic Forum says Pakistan ranks in the bottom 20 out of the world's economies. Nadeem Ul Haque, deputy chairman of the state Planning Commission, says nobody really wants to talk about economic reform, or draw up new fiscal policies.\n\"The debate is always so charged with religion and geopolitics and war on terror, just talking about economics takes second place  -  in fact fifth place, in fact seventh place, 10th place,\" Haque says. \"Nobody really wants to talk about economics.\"\nAnd while the government avoids making difficult economic policy decisions, key industries in Pakistan are taking a hit.\nA Target For Extremist Recruitment\nAt the Sitara textile mill in the eastern city of Faisalabad, huge panels of cotton are imprinted with pictures of Spider-Man and Justin Bieber. They will be turned into duvet covers and sent to the U.S., says the plant's general manager, Ashfaq Ahmad.\nHe says his mill is the only one in Pakistan that has two machines for doing flatbed printing  -  but only one of them is running. The other is closed, he says, because of a gas shutdown.\nAhmad says serious gas and electricity shortages mean that this and other plants in Faisalabad can only operate four days a week. Power outages can last up to six hours a day.\nRehan Naseem Bharara, vice president of Faisalabad's Chamber of Commerce, says many textile factories have shut down, and another just recently reduced staff.\n\"They had about 13,000 people in their factory three years back, but now only 3,400 people are working,\" Bharara says.\nHe says the cutbacks have had a huge impact on the community, especially the jobless, who become an \"easy target for ... people who promote terrorism in this country.\"\nWestern analysts say the decaying economy is as much of a threat to Pakistan's stability as the Taliban because widespread poverty and unemployment could lead to more political instability and an increase in extremism.\nSecurity forces fired above a large crowd during recent demonstrations over an anti-Islam video. Most of those involved were young people. Pakistan has one of the world's fastest-growing populations, and job prospects for young people are growing dimmer.\nElusive Growth To Combat 'Youth Bulge'\nTake a group of university students, who lounge on a bench and play guitar at an abandoned Islamabad train station on a recent day. Until six months ago, freight trains used to make regular stops at the station. Now the tracks are overgrown. The station is closed because of the rising cost of fuel and a shortage of train engines in the country. The university students use the area for relaxation, dating and talking politics.\nTaheer Walid studies business, but he knows the chances of finding a job when he's finished with school are slim to none.\n\"Currently, if you talk about Pakistan, yes, this is the time to make a revolution,\" Walid says. \"I mean, uncertainties are totally there ... political uncertainties and everything.\"\nHaque, the deputy planning commissioner, says the country is currently growing at just over 3 percent, but that's not nearly enough to deal with what he calls the \"youth bulge.\"\n\"We estimate there are about 90 million kids under the age of 20, and unless we grow the economy at 7 or 8 percent, we will not be able to employ these youths,\" he says.\nHaque says that growth has to be consistent over the next 20 years. But that, he adds, is a tough order. Copyright 2012 National Public Radio. To see more, visit ."

        "webpage": "Taxing bankers' bonuses 'does not breach their human rights'\nCommittee of MPs and peers concludes that new tax is compatible with European law\nThe City of London from the air. Photograph: Jason Hawkes/Getty Images\nWhen it emerged that Alistair Darling was planning to announce a tax on bankers' bonuses in the pre-budget report, some figures in the City seemed to think that their human rights were about to be infringed.Bill Dodwell, the head of taxation at the accountants Deloitte, revealed that he had taken calls from bankers wanting to know if they could use the Human Rights Act to protect their cash.The prospect of legal action always seemed slightly far-fetched, but the joint committee on human rights - a committee of MPs and peers - took the issue sufficiently seriously to launch a mini-inquiry. And, in a report published today, it concludes that the bankers are not having their human rights abused.The issue arises because article one of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) gives people a right to \"peaceful enjoyment of possessions\" (bonuses included). Taxation obviously involves an interference with this right. But article one also says the right to property should not stop the state securing the payment of taxes. The committee says that the state does not have \"unlimited\" powers in relation to taxation and that tax demands must \"satisfy the requirements of proportionality\", but it also says the \"threshold of justification to be met by the state [in this regard] is very much lower than in relation to other ECHR rights\".The committee says taxation measures can be incompatible with the ECHR if they are \"devoid of reasonable foundation or impose an individual or excessive burden on particular people\". But it says these conditions do not apply to the bonus tax.It is ... clear that the hurdle facing anyone challenging a taxing measure under article one, protocol one is very high. They must demonstrate that the measure is devoid of reasonable foundation or imposes an excessive and individual burden which is disproportionate to the public good. Even on the basis of the summary justifications provided in the pre-budget report it would appear difficult to conclude that the measure is devoid of reasonable foundation.The measure is likely to raise a not insignificant amount of revenue (estimated to be about \u00a30.55bn); it is part of a package of measures designed to address excessive risk-taking in the banking industry and to require banks to consider the soundness of their capital base; it is directed at banks rather than individual bankers; and it is intended to be a one-off tax, in place only until the more systemic reforms in the financial services bill come into force.Nor is it likely that those who are most directly affected by the new tax will be able to demonstrate hardship amounting to an excessive individual burden.The committee concludes that it is \"unlikely\" that any court would conclude that the tax was incompatible with the ECHR."

        "webpage": "Europeans Give Banks Little Credit\nby Jay Loschky and Julie Ray\nOnly one in 10 in Cyprus, Spain confident in financial institutions in 2013\nThis article is part of a weeklong series focusing on how people worldwide answer some of today's most pressing questions about employment and the economy.\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Europeans continued to lead the world in their distrust of banks in 2013, with countries hardest hit in Europe's lingering banking and debt crisis topping the list. Confidence in banking sank to a low of 11% in Cyprus and Spain, where residents were the least likely out of 124 countries Gallup surveyed to express trust in their financial institutions.\nA few countries -- Ireland, Spain, and Portugal -- have exited from their financial bailouts since the 2013 surveys were conducted. However, the findings suggest a widespread lack of public trust in financial institutions that could be difficult for the European Central Bank (ECB) to assuage when it assumes new supervisory responsibilities for eurozone banks this fall. In six European Union countries, a quarter or less expressed confidence in their banks, and in 24 out of the 28 EU member states, confidence was lower than the global average of 60%.\nThe 26-percentage-point slump in Cypriots' trust in their financial institutions between 2012 and 2013 is hardly surprising. Originally set off by the subprime mortgage crisis in the U.S., the Cyprus financial crisis reached a crescendo in March 2013 following a 10 billion euro bailout led by the ECB and the International Monetary Fund. Unlike previous bailouts in Greece, Ireland, and Spain, Cypriots were particularly shaken by the terms of the bailout agreement, which included a deposit levy, requiring bank depositors to help cover the cost of the bailout. In 2014, confidence recovered modestly to 16%.\nSimilarly, Spaniards' trust in their banks also sank to the then all-time low of 11% in May 2013 after the Rajoy administration requested European funds to recapitalize its struggling banks in late 2012. Gallup's surveys in Spain in 2014 show this confidence has not improved even though the country has emerged from its bailout, just 9% express trust in their banks this year.\nConfidence High in South Asia\nOn the Indian subcontinent, confidence in the region's financial systems may be a positive indicator for continued economic growth. In 2013, several South Asian countries rate among the world's most confident in financial institutions, including Bhutan (96%), Nepal (86%), Sri Lanka (85%), Bangladesh (85%), and India (77%). Indians' confidence in their financial institutions -- up from 69% in 2012 -- in particular can be viewed as a boost to that country's economic stability amid continuing economic concerns over the past year.\nEuropeans' low confidence in their banking system does not bode well for the region's recovery, or for financial markets worldwide, particularly with the specter of banking troubles rising again in central and Eastern Europe. From the perspective of European consumers, EU provisions targeting Cypriot depositors could also raise doubts about the security of their savings. Where confidence levels in financial institutions were already low, the prospect that governments could levy taxes on bank accounts to pay for costly bailouts could further erode residents' trust.\nThe data in this article were generated from Gallup Analytics. For complete data sets or custom research from the more than 150 countries Gallup continually surveys, please contact us.\nResults are based on telephone and face-to-face interviews with 1,000 adults, aged 15 and older, conducted in 124 countries in 2013. For results based on the total sample of national adults, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error ranged from a low of \u00b12.1 percentage points to a high of \u00b15.6 percentage points.

At a dinner in the chancellery on Monday, they began using the familiar \"du\" and \"tu\" form with each other, according to aides.\n\nMr Hollande pointed to the fiscal compact on budget discipline, a December deal on banking supervision and the agreement to keep Greece in the euro zone as fruits of his strong relationship with Dr Merkel.\n\n\"It has not escaped you that we do not belong to the same political family. Despite that, if you look back at the past eight months, I'm very happy with what France and Germany have been able to accomplish to get the euro zone out of its crisis,\" the French leader said. \"If you look at the results, it's clear we're on the same wavelength.\"\n\nDr Merkel, who refused to meet with Mr Hollande during last year's French election campaign while openly supporting his conservative opponent Nicolas Sarkozy, said: \"It may be our best-kept secret that the chemistry actually works.\"\n\nAs part of the festivities to mark the anniversary, Dr Merkel and Mr Hollande answered questions for over an hour yesteray evening from some 200 French and German students. Later on Tuesday they will attend a concert at the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\nIn a joint declaration, they said they would encourage unions, employers and workers in their countries to establish joint working groups to make proposals on competitiveness.\n\nThe leaders also touched on France's military intervention in Mali, with Mr Hollande thanking Dr Merkel for offering political and material support, including the use of two transport planes to fly West African troops to the capital Bamako.\n\n\"We know this is a difficult military mission that France is undertaking at the moment for all of us,\" Dr Merkel said."

        "webpage": "//Home//Blogs//Marginal Utility\nWhat Is a Middle-Class Job?\nTweet Is a middle-class job one whose work marks the employee with a certain class status, or is it one whose income affords the employee a certain lifestyle?\nI started reading this essay, \"What If Middle-Class Jobs Disappear?\" by economist Arnold Kling, in which he argues his case for structural unemployment and the jobless recovery as a reflection of the economy's need to \"recalculate\" how best to use its resources. He writes, \"The economy is in a state of transition, in which the middle-class jobs that emerged after World War II have begun to decline.\"\nBut what constitutes a \"middle-class job\"? How you frame the answer to that will dictate whether or not you would bother to care whether they disappear. (I suspect Peter Frase probably wouldn't mind.) The question becomes more pertinent when you consider how much political rhetoric and policy revolves around helping the \"struggling middle class\" and when, as Kling suggests, the sorts of skills associated with the established middle classes are being increasingly automated. Some pundits argue that if certain \"middle-class\" skills are automated, new ones will become valuable, or at least valued in the market. Someone recently - I can't find the link; damn you, new Google Reader! - was imagining we will in the future hire plumbers on the basis of how well they know philosophy. Matt Yglesias often makes this point too that increased productivity should lead to people developing ever more recondite and self-actualizing marketable skills: fewer cashiers, more cognitarians; that sort of thing.\nBut is a middle-class job one whose work marks the employee with a certain class status, or is it one whose income affords the employee a certain lifestyle?\nIs a middle-class job one which guarantees one an income that places one in the middle class statistically? Do we expect everyone to belong to the middle class (at which point it would no longer be in the \"middle\" of anything - \"class\" would disappear for real into something like the 99 percent vs. 1 percent construct)? Or do we expect middle-class jobs to serve as a marker of class distinction that preserves the status hierarchy, and the sense that some workers, some people, are more significant to society than others. That is, should middle-class job betoken the professional class, or the creative class, or some other euphemism? Another way of framing this question is: What are jobs for? The obvious answer from the point of view of the worker is to get money, but there is obviously a lot more bound up with employment status and who is allowed to do what sort of work and what sort of credentials are required and how one qualifies to be credentialed. Sorting jobs into low and middle and high-class is not simply about pay, but about habitus. So are jobs a system that justifies the unequal distribution of shares of the social surplus? Are they a way to allow society to be sorted into winners and losers while still seeming fair and/or just? There is obviously often a discrepancy between skills and wages, between working hard and earning a lot. Middle-class job is often another way of saying, white collar, which was a semipolite way of saying \"not working class,\" for whom the arduousness of the labor has nothing to do with the expected rewards and work discipline (the threat of firing, of being yelled out, etc.) is the chief incentive. \"Middle-class job,\" it seems to me, implies certain prerogatives more than a certain wage. You will be spared the drudge work; your work will be socially respected such that you will be granted some autonomy in performing it. You will not be bullied because you have been vetted and proved a reliable self-starter. You will discipline yourself and will feel sufficiently guilty about stealing time, or your stealing time will actually constitute productive work, virtuosic in Virno's sense. Are these jobs disappearing? That is, is capital increasingly having to eschew its neoliberal \"you're a creative free agent entrepreneur\" shtick and bully and threaten workers to continue to make its profits? Robert Horning has developed a substantial body of work in PopMatters' music reviews, concerts, film, and TV sections. His writing has also appeared in Time Out New York and Skyscraper.

        "webpage": "Obama decides not to extend term of jobs council\nBy JOSH LEDERMANAssociated Press\nGeneral Electric Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt listens at right as President Barack Obama meets with the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. WASHINGTON, D.C.  -  President Barack Obama is letting his jobs council expire, cutting off one source of input from business leaders while unemployment remains stubbornly high.\nObama formed the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in January 2011, when unemployment was about 9 percent. It's now 7.8 percent, though more than 12 million people are out of work.\nObama's executive order establishing the council said it would go out of business Jan. 31, 2013. The White House said Thursday that Obama had no plans to renew its charter.\n\"The work of the jobs council was very valuable,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \"While the president didn't agree with all of its recommendations, he agreed with many of them and acted on a number of them.\"\nWhite House officials said Obama intended for the council to fulfill its mission and then wind down, and that he would seek input about the economy from business leaders in other ways. Among the steps Obama plans to pursue are expedited permits for public works projects, plus programs to boost entrepreneurship and workforce development.\nEven before Obama's decision was clear, Republicans seized on the council's likely expiration as evidence the president hadn't spent enough time on trying to create jobs, which is a priority for Americans. The Republican National Committee called it part of \"the failed Obama record,\" while the House Republicans' campaign committee, in an online petition, accused Obama of laying off his own jobs council.\nAdding to the concern about the job market's vulnerability, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December of last year, the first quarterly drop since 2009. The Federal Reserve said the economy appears to have \"paused in recent months.\"\nThe jobs council was a successor to an economic advisory board Obama created at the onset of his presidency. The panel was chaired by General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt and included prominent business leaders and economists. Immelt said Thursday that progress has been made on putting in place 90 percent of the council's recommendations.\nObama met with the council only a few times. During the last meeting, in February 2012, the president and the council highlighted an engineering education initiative alongside school deans.\n\"The president treated his jobs council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nThe council's main product was a report, \"Roadmap to Renewal,\" that was released in January 2012. The council also organized a series of meetings across the country last year with business owners, elected officials and academics; Obama didn't attend those election-year sessions.\nCritics have argued that the council's primary purpose was to create the appearance of action at a time when the nation was pining for something to rein in soaring joblessness. The administration acted on many of the council's recommendations, including suggestions to streamline permitting and small business loans, increase tourist visas and boost energy efficiency.\nBut the White House was at odds with several council members on tax policies, particularly a proposal to exclude overseas corporate earnings from U.S. taxes. That idea divided even the jobs council, whose membership included labor and Obama's political allies.\n\"It was helpful in terms of putting a spotlight on a variety of issues, but particularly helpful in the area of entrepreneurship,\" said AOL co-founder Steve Case, a member of the panel, in an interview. \"There's still work to be done, but we did make good progress.\"\nThe council's dissolution also comes as White House aides are optimistic about the prospects for a second-term detente with business.\nDuring Obama's first term, business leaders bristled at his harsh depiction of \"fat-cat bankers\" and his efforts to impose regulations, tax policies and spending initiatives they argued were unfriendly to business. Obama aides hope the warming of ties between the president and the business world can benefit the White House in future fiscal debates with Republicans.\nWhite House officials said the president made a fresh effort to reach out to business in the days following his re-election. Between the November election and the end of 2012, in the height of negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff,\" more than 400 business leaders, ranging from CEOs of large multinational companies to small business owners, met with Obama or his aides at the White House, officials said."

        "webpage": "Costs and Charges in a Unit Linked Insurance Plan\n\nWhile we are on the topic of ULIPs and after having discussed and understood the working, features and benefits of a ULIP in the last two articles, it is also essential to know what are the various kinds of expenses and charges involved with a ULIP. Though ULIPs are transparent and the client gets to know exactly how much of his premium goes towards charges once he has taken the policy, Insurance Companies seldom talk about it in detail while marketing and selling their policies. Unit Linked Policies with huge recurring expenses eat away a major portion of the profits earned by way of NAV appreciation.\n\nPremium Allocation charges - These are charges to cover the running expenses of a policy and to pay for issuance and distribution commissions. These are a percentage of the regular/single premium paid and are usually high in the first year. For Example - If a product has an allocation charge of 5 % in the 1st year, an amount of Rs 5000 would be deducted from the first annual premium of Rs 100000/- towards this expense.\n\nPolicy Administrative charges - These are levied for the administration of the policy - IT, operational etc. These charges usually get adjusted in Unit Value or the NAV, and the NAV is declared after adjusting these costs.\n\nFund Management Fee - All Unit Linked plans have underlying funds constituting of various financial instruments like equity, debt, money market etc. The Fund Management Fee or FMC is levied to pay for managing these instruments - cost of buying and selling them for various funds. The fund option which has a higher percentage of equity would have higher charges.\n\nMortality charges - This covers the cost of providing life protection for the insured and is expressed as per thousand of the Sum Assured or life cover. For example if a person aged 35 buys a ULIP with a life cover of Rs 10 Lakhs and a mortality charge of 1.5 , the recurring mortality charge would be (1.5* 10Lakhs)/1000 = Rs 1500.\n\nRider charges- These pay for other protection benefits that the policyholder has chosen- accident benefit, critical illness etc.\n\nSurrender charges - If the policyholder wishes to close the policy or withdraw partially during the term, this charge may apply. Usually this charge is applicable only for withdrawal in the first few years.\n\nTransaction charges - These are specific charges levied when the client does transactions like switching between funds or top ups."

        "webpage": "Extension Gardener\nSuccessful Family\nPerspectives Online\n\" YOU DECIDE: Are we in trouble? | Main\n| Economist sees slow economic recovery\" YOU DECIDE: Is capitalism up for grabs?\nMEDIA CONTACT: Dr. Mike Walden, 919.515.4671 or \nMedia  a high-resolution version of this photo, call 919.513.3127 or e-mail .\nMore so than at any time in the last 70 years, our fundamental economic system -- capitalism -- is being questioned. Capitalism is a system of private ownership of resources and private decisions about how those resources are used. While we certainly don't have a pure form of capitalism -- public decisions (government) do play a major role in our economy -- business decisions about what to produce and what prices to set and household decisions about where to work and what to buy are largely left in private hands.\nBut some are now saying the capitalist system has failed us. The basis for this statement is the recession. While recessions occur with some degree of regularity, the severity of the recession which began in late 2007 has shocked most people. It has revived ideas that capitalism is inherently unstable and requires more government control.\nWhat is the intellectual basis for this claim? There are two fundamental roots to the argument. One comes from the English economist Keynes who believed capitalist economies go through periods of optimism and pessimism. During the optimistic times, consumer spending is high and investment returns are significant. Then, something sparks a mood change to pessimism. Investors sell, returns fall and consumers retreat by curtailing spending and increasing saving. These economic conditions prompt a recession.\nSeveral factors could cause the change in attitude (\"animal spirits\" in Keynes' language). Bad weather could cause crop failures or floods. International political tensions could increase the chance of war. Or technological advances may cause investors initially to over-estimate the resulting investment returns. Then, when reality sets in, there's an investment pullback (a bust) and subsequent decline in the broader economy.\nIn the 1970s the economist Hyman Minsky offered a somewhat different, although related, cause for capitalism's instability. Minsky focused on the banking system and the instability caused by fractional reserve banking. Fractional reserve banking results in depositors' total claims on banks' reserves exceeding those reserves. For example, a bank may have $10 million in loans but only $2 million in reserves. The system works fine when the banks' loans succeed. But if a substantial number of the loans fail, the result can be a run on the bank by depositors and collapse of the financial system.\nSome observers say a \"Minsky moment\" occurred in the 2007-09 recession, when a drop in housing values effectively prompted a run on the \"shadow\" banking system (hedge funds, investment banks) and brought the nation -- and world -- close to a financial calamity.\nBelievers in either of these two bases for capitalism's instability see a need for greater regulation of our economic system, including restrictions on how financial managers are compensated, what products financial firms can offer and additional public funds to be used for the rescue of large (too big to fail) companies. Some of these ideas are embodied in legislation currently being considered by Congress.\nBut there is an alternative view, which says that rather than private decision-makers making capitalism inherently unstable, it is the actions of public decision-makers that are the source of the problem. The Federal Reserve can create economic instability by alternatively increasing and then decreasing the availability and cost of credit. This realization led the economist Milton Friedman to propose replacing the Federal Reserve Board with a computer programmed to increase the credit supply at a constant rate. Public decision-makers can also create instability by changing tax rules and government spending programs.\nIndeed, a strong argument can be made that the housing market crash and 2007-2009 recession resulted from easy and ample credit provided by the Federal Reserve in the early 2000s, a change in the tax law in the late 1990s increasing the tax value of homeownership and the aggressive promotion of homeownership by the quasi-governmental agencies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\nMany economic historians have argued that capitalism has brought more prosperity to more people than any other economic system developed. But the economic events of the last two years have called the system into question. Each person will have to decide the degree to which capitalism is at fault. My own advice, as a professional economist, is to carefully consider any changes.\nDr. Mike Walden is a William Neal Reynolds Professor and North Carolina Cooperative Extension economist in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics of N.C.

Previously, Beijing had agreed to negotiations only if certain Chinese industries, especially in its service sector, were exempt.\nTim Stratford, a co-chair on the Chamber's legal committee and a former U.S. trade negotiator, said the Chinese government's commitment to return to talks reflected \"a lot of study.\"\n\"It was not a casual undertaking on their part. Given all the work that has gone into these negotiations already and given the momentum behind them ... we are feeling optimistic that the negotiations will be successful,\" Stratford said.\n\"It's hard to say how long that will take, but it is not something that will be done in a few months,\" he said.

        "webpage": "Auditor adds teacher pensions to high-risk list\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The state auditor's office on Thursday added teacher pensions to the list of high-risk issues facing California government. The report by State Auditor Elaine Howle added the nation's largest teacher pension fund because it can't meet the costs of retirement benefits beyond the next 30 years. The pension funding problem was added to a list of risks that also includes California's chronic budget deficit, unfunded retiree health costs and prison crowding. It's a well-known problem. The California State Teachers' Retirement System reported in March that it had 71 percent of the assets needed to cover retirement costs for its 852,000 members and family members. The estimated shortfall is $56 billion. School districts and educators pay a percentage of each employee's salary into the pension fund to pay for benefits, but the percentage has not changed for decades. As recently as 2001, the fund had 98 percent of the assets it needed, but benefit changes and economic slumps that hurt asset values have reduced that number. Both the pension board and Gov. Jerry Brown have called for funding changes to shore up long-term finances at CalSTRS. The board of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which covers state and local government workers, can change contribution amounts on its own, but changes to CalSTRS funding require action by the state Legislature. The report underscores what CalSTRS officials have been saying for years, said Ricardo Duran, a spokesman for the fund. \"The issues are long-range ones, but the longer it takes to develop a plan, the more costly will be the solution,\" Duran said in an email. The long-term financial health of public pension funds has been a hot political topic across the nation, including during California budget negotiations this spring. Some Democratic lawmakers still hope to pass a limited pension reform package in the California Legislature this year, while GOP legislators have introduced a proposed constitutional amendment covering a broad package of pension changes.

Zhu Zhixin, vice minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, speaks at a conference Friday. [china.com.cn] Zhu Zhixin, vice minister of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said at a State Council Information Office conference that the overseas market was still severe and the country's economic policy direction would remain unchanged.\nAlthough the country's economy has shown signs of recovery, it still faces of many difficulties in maintaining stability, he said.\n\"Any change in the macro-economic policy would disturb the recovery or rebound momentum, or even perish the previous efforts and achievements,\" he said. \"Efforts to keep a stable and fast economic development is the top priority of the country in the second half.\"\nBoosted by a surge in investment driven by the stimulus, China's annual economic growth quickened to 7.9 percent in the second quarter, up from 6.1 percent in the first quarter and 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.\nWhen asked whether a large amount of loan extension would result in inflation, Su Ning, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, or the central bank, said the country's moderately easy monetary policy has played an important role in boosting investors' confidence, enlarging domestic consumption, and inflation should not be a current concern.\nRelated readings:\nChina vows to stick to macroeconomic policies in H2\nHu urges adherence to macroeconomic policies\nChina should continue macroeconomic policy: economist\nMacro Economy: Nation may top Japan GDP in '09\nMacro Economy: Domestic demand will be raised\nChinese banks advanced a record 7.37 trillion yuan ($1.08 trillion) in new loans during the first half of the year, exceeding the full-year target of 5 trillion yuan.\nAccording to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, China's consumer price index, a main gauge of inflation, dipped 1.1 percent in the first half from a year earlier.

Those who expect a decrease anticipate that to be between just 4% and 9%.\n\"Despite a difficult economic climate, it is encouraging to see the financial services industry recognizing the importance of continued investment in financial crime defenses. 2014 will see cybercrime and insider, payment, and online fraud continuing to pose a threat to businesses bottom lines, and companies must ensure they are sufficiently prepared to combat these threats,\" says George Robbins, general manager, Financial Crime, at BAE Systems Detica, a provider of information intelligence solutions. On a regulatory level, Basel III has been overwhelmingly identified as the regulation that will have the greatest impact on businesses, and the framework looks set to present organizations with challenges that will continue long into the foreseeable future.\"\nThe 2013 survey also revealed the types of financial crime initiatives that are the biggest priorities for senior management teams. The focus this year has remained firmly on cybercrime (with businesses giving this category an average rating of 7.74 out of 10 as a priority area), insider and payment fraud (7.44 and 7.37), and online fraud (7.11). These concerns among businesses reflect the high number of breaches of both personally identifiable information and commercially identifiable information at financial institutions and data suppliers over the past year.\nLooking further ahead, the survey reveals that Basel III (the global, voluntary regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing, and market liquidity risk) is viewed as the regulation that will have the biggest effect on business operations over the next three years, with over half of respondents (53%) predicting that the regulation will have a major impact on their operations. This is the single largest 'major impact' response recorded since the survey began in 2007, and reflects the fact that Basel III is challenging financial institutions to change business models in order to enhance supervisory oversight to improve the quality of capital and contain potential economic mishap.\nAnother area identified as a concern is that of information security and data-breach legislation, which was singled out by over a third of respondents (38%) as having a major impact. European Union data-breach regulations, which came into effect in August 2013, are widely believed to be a precursor to a more expansive protection framework with a wider application within financial services.

States Promote Bullion as Legal Tender\nArizona legislature poised to recognize gold and silver coins amid concerns about the U.S. dollar.\nBy Amanda J. Crawford April 8, 2013\nDistrust of the Federal Reserve and concern that U.S. dollars may become worthless are fueling a push in more than a dozen states to recognize gold and silver coins as legal tender.\nLawmakers in Arizona are poised to follow Utah, which authorized bullion for currency in 2011. Similar bills are advancing in Kansas, South Carolina and other states.\nThe Tea Party-backed measures are mostly symbolic -- you still can't pay for groceries with gold in Utah. They reflect lingering dollar concerns, amplified by the Fed's unconventional moves in recent years to stabilize the economy, said Loren Gatch, who teaches politics at the University of Central Oklahoma.\n\"The legislation is about signaling discontent with monetary policy and about what Ben Bernanke is doing,\" said Gatch, who studies alternative currencies at the Edmond, Oklahoma-based school. \"There is a fear that the government, or Bernanke in particular and the Federal Reserve, is pursuing a policy that will lead to the collapse of the dollar. That's what is behind it.\"\nBernanke has pushed interest rates to near zero since the 18-month recession that began in December 2007. The Fed said in March it would continue buying $85 billion in securities each month in a program known as quantitative easing that has ballooned its assets beyond $3 trillion and is aimed at keeping long-term borrowing costs low to support economic growth.\nConsumer prices rose just 1.3 percent in February from a year earlier, according to an inflation measure favored by the Fed. That was below the central bank's 2 percent target and compares with occasional bouts of more-than 10 percent increases in the 1970s and early 1980s.\nBets that inflation would pick up because of economic stimulus measures helped fuel a 78 percent jump in gold since December 2008. The dollar's rise to less than 1 percent below a one-year high set in July and monthly increases of about 2 percent or less in the U.S. consumer price index have curbed demand for bullion. Since reaching a record $1,923.70 an ounce in 2011, gold prices have fallen and are near a bear market.\nGold futures for June delivery fell 1.2 percent last week, to $1,575.90 an ounce on the Comex in New York, after touching $1,539.40 April 4, a 10-month low for a most-active contract.\nTexas Depository\nIn Texas, lawmakers are considering a measure supported by Republican Governor Rick Perry to establish the Texas Bullion Depository to store gold bars valued at about $1 billion and held in a New York bank warehouse. The gold is owned by the University of Texas Investment Management Co., or Utimco, which took delivery of 6,643 bars of the precious metal in 2011 amid concern that demand for it would overwhelm supply.\nThe proposed facility would also accept deposits from the public, and would provide a basis for a payments system in the state in the event of a \"systemic dislocation in a national and international financial system,\" according to the measure.\nShould Texas take such a step, it would offer sovereign backing for deposits and make buying and storing gold easier, said Jim Rickards, senior managing director at Tangent Capital Partners LLC in New York and author of \"Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis.\" He said the coin measures, while impractical, have symbolic value.\n\"We are seeing a distinct movement back to a world where gold is considered money,\" Rickards said.\nThe measures give \"people the option of using money that won't lose any purchasing power to inflation,\" said Rich Danker, economics director at the American Principles Project. The Washington-based public-policy group supports the steps as well as a return to the gold standard, which pegged the dollar's value to bullion. President Richard Nixon formally ended the convertibility of U.S. currency to the precious metal in 1971."

Numerous studies note that children born and raised in fatherless, single-parent homes are much more likely to live in poverty, experience depression, have trouble in school and get in trouble with the law than are children raised in married, two-parent households. Unfortunately, strong marriages and intact families increasingly seem the exception to the rule these days. With high divorce rates and almost 40 percent of all American children (about 70 percent of black children) born out of wedlock, the intact American family appears to be on a slippery, downward slope. A new study finds that the burden of broken families is borne by all taxpayers, regardless of their own family status. In analyzing government expenditures on welfare, health care and education and criminal justice as well as lost tax revenues, Georgia College & State University economist Ben Scafidi suggests divorce and single parenthood cost taxpayers approximately $112 billion a year. Professor Scafidi's report makes no formal policy recommendations, but he notes that reducing these costs \"is a legitimate concern of government, policymakers and legislators.\" This study was commissioned by the Institute for American Values, Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, Families Northwest and the Georgia Family Council. These pro-family groups have some suggestions. They hope this study will prompt lawmakers to invest more money in programs to bolster and strengthen marriage such as those found in Oklahoma and Texas. Typically, the report has its critics, but do the critics have any solutions to the problem of broken homes? Syracuse University economics professor Tim Smeeding advocates increased investment in job creation. Commenting on the Scafidi report, he told the Associated Press: \"I have nothing against marriage - relationship-building is great. But alone it's not going to do the job. A full-employment economy would probably be the best thing - decent, stable jobs.\" \"Full employment\" does not mean everyone has a job. The international Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development has instead suggested full employment occurs when the unemployment rate ranges between four and 6.4 percent. The United States had a 5.1 percent unemployment rate in March of 2008 and has been at or below 6.4 percent since April of 1994. Between 1994 and 2006, however, the U.S. Census Bureau reported \"little variation\" in the number of single-parent households. Professor Smeeding added: \"A high number of African-American men have been in prison - that limits their future earning potential and makes them bad marriage partners, regardless of what kind of person they are. A marriage program doesn't address that problem at all.\" Striving for intact families may be the solution. A report by Professors June O'Neill and M. Anne Hill of Baruch College found black children in single-parent households were twice as likely to commit crimes as those in families with a father and 70 percent of juvenile hall residents and 43 percent of prison inmates came from fatherless homes. In her criticism, University of Michigan sociologist Pamela Smock advocated greater investment in education to improve the economic prospects for children from fragmented families. However, the District of Columbia public schools rank near the top of the list in per capita student spending but at the bottom on student test scores. Considering this, it's obvious spending money does not automatically create opportunity - it just adds to the $112 billion Scafidi study total. But Professor Scafidi makes an important point: \"Because of the very large taxpayer costs associated with high rates of divorce and unwed childbearing, and the modest price tags associated with most marriage-strengthening initiatives... programs even with very modest success rates will be cost-effective.\" Granted, the jury may still be out on whether or not government-funded pro-marriage, job-creation and education programs will counter the corrosive effects of divorce and single parenthood. There is no question, however, that divorce and single parenthood are bad for children, families and communities, and they cost American taxpayers a bundle. # # # Darryn \"Dutch\" Martin is a member of the national advisory council of the Project 21 black leadership network.

Is the Cayman-Dublin route under threat?\nSat, 01/10/2005 - 22:00 Tags : European Distribution for Hedge Funds [1]\nAn increasingly important issue for hedge funds targeting European markets is the choice of domicile and listing.\nOne of the most popular approaches in recent years has been to domicile funds in offshore jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, or the British Virgin Islands, but have them administered in Dublin and listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. However, this is starting to be challenged by the growth in importance of Luxembourg as a hedge fund centre.\nIn addition, there are moves toward the domiciliation, servicing and stock exchange listing of funds in the jurisdiction in which they are to be marketed, in response to legislative moves by countries such as France, Germany and Italy to encourage the creation of domestic hedge funds geared at least to some extent toward a more retail market.\nDublin has allowed the listing of offshore hedge funds for a long time, but it was only quite recently - in July 2004 - that the Luxembourg Stock Exchange also authorised the listing of such funds. This should be a good opportunity for Luxembourg to attract offshore funds and to compete on a level basis with Dublin, because the exchange's unwillingness to list Cayman and British Virgin Islands funds has been a handicap for Luxembourg in the past.\nThis can be an advantage given that offshore fund promoters often choose their administrator and service providers in the country where they have their listing. It's more convenient to have the stock exchange, the administrator and the custodian in the same place, which is why Luxembourg has chosen to admit offshore funds. Now, from a regulatory point of view, Luxembourg and Dublin are quite similar.\nHowever, Dublin and Luxembourg do not necessarily target the same customers. In general English-speaking asset managers, notably from the US, go to Dublin, whether they use a Cayman or Irish fund, whereas Luxembourg has a continental European location, meaning that people from the Netherlands, Germany and France are more likely to go there.\nFrom a product distribution point of view, funds regulated by the Luxembourg or Irish authorities are easier to sell to institutional investors than structures established offshore. Such big investors have strict risk policies and investment rules, and are often constrained from using less regulated funds. A Luxembourg or Irish structure may be less flexible, but you have a less risky, more regulated product that is easier to sell.\nMany asset managers have established their hedge fund structures in Dublin, but in some cases their choice may have been driven by the fact that Dublin was synonymous with alternative investments, rather than a strict comparison between the two centres. There was a feeling that you had to go to Dublin to launch a hedge fund.\nThe fund industry in the Grand Duchy has done a good job over the past two or three years to change the minds of asset managers, who now tend to think about Luxembourg when they administer their portfolios. However, it's difficult to tell whether the ability to list Cayman and BVI funds has had much impact so far. In the long term it should be an advantage, but it may a take a year to become apparent.\nMeanwhile, in France, Germany and Italy new regulations allow onshore funds to be set up, with the aim of building up local expertise and improving risk monitoring. The German financial regulator, BaFin, has established a flexible framework for hedge fund managers, but this is undermined by the tax reporting imposed by the German ministry of finance. The transparency requirements are especially difficult to meet for funds of hedge funds, and overall the rules make it very difficult in practical terms to set up an onshore hedge fund in Germany.\nFrance is a big market for alternative investments, and major asset managers such as Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Ixis have had large ranges of hedge funds for some time, but they are all domiciled in Dublin or Luxembourg.\nThat why the French financial regulator, the AMF, recently decided to create a new regime to encourage the establishment of onshore funds. The new regime, which provides a lighter regulatory touch and allows funds to use leverage, is much more flexible and streamlined than the regular legislation on investment funds. The first French onshore hedge funds were authorised by the regulator in April this year.\nTags : European Distribution for Hedge Funds [1]\nSource URL: \nLinks:[1]"

        "webpage": "The Challenge of Making the Sharing Economy Count\nJanuary 25, 2016, 9:35 AM EDT\nThe U.K.'s \"sharing economy\" - as nebulous a term as that is  -  creates efficiencies that don't get factored in when calculating the health of the country's economy.\nThat's the message in a report lobbed at the government Monday by economist Diane Coyle, a professor at the University of Manchester and former government adviser.\nAccording to Coyle, the techniques used to calculate gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.K. don't capture the economic impact of peer-to-peer activities taking place on platforms such as Uber uber\n, Fiverr and Airbnb airbnb\n. As a result, she claimed, the government may be underestimating investment and the size of the British economy, and its statistics could be missing the extra hours people spend on less-formal business activities.\nSubscribe to Data Sheet, Fortune's daily newsletter on the business of technology\nAt this point, it's important to note that Coyle's report was commissioned by Airbnb and Sharing Economy U.K. The government-backed trade body happens to be chaired by Debbie Wosskow, the CEO of sharing-economy firm Love Home Swap, which are hardly neutral backers.\nHowever, Coyle does have plenty of cred, having literally written the book (well, a book) on GDP.\n\"It is clear to me that traditional measures of productivity cannot adequately capture the economic impact of the sharing economy, in part because GDP figures do not take into account economic benefits such as time saved, increased choice and lower cost of products - all of which are key consumer benefits of using the sharing economy,\" she said in a statement.\nFor more on the sharing economy, watch the following Fortune video: Lower prices and reduced purchasing (for instance by using a rideshare platform rather than buying a car) could look like reduced economic growth if not fully recorded, Coyle noted while arguing that more data needs to be collected from individuals, not just businesses and platforms.\nWhy does this matter? If Coyle's analysis is correct and the sharing economy is taking off - she thinks its \"highly likely\" that 3% of the workforce is providing services over platforms such as Airbnb and Uber - then the government should have every incentive to factor this into its calculations. Everyone likes a healthy economy.\nFor sharing-economy companies, recognition of their claimed contribution would also be handy when lobbying over how such services are regulated. As Wosskow said, \"better data will make for a more informed policy debate.\"\nAs it happens, the British government has already demonstrated some friendliness towards these firms. Airbnb itself was legalized (with some restrictions) in London last May, and the mere existence of Sharing Economy U.K., with Wosskow at the top, speaks for itself.\nCoyle's report even comes with a foreword from business secretary Sajid Javid, who gushed: \"The contribution to the wider U.K. economy of this sector goes far beyond just an economic one - it's creating new networks within communities and having a positive impact on the environment by using resources more efficiently.\"\nWhile he fell short of promising new stats-collecting practices, Javid hailed the report as an \"important landmark in addressing both the productivity and sharing-economy agendas in this country.\" Indeed, both of those agendas may be well served by the introduction of new measuring techniques.\n\u2190 Want Smarter Apps?

At the end of this week another meeting will be held which will hopefully have a more optimistic outcome: the APEC CEO summit, bringing together business leaders from the Asia Pacific region and beyond.\nThe Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation is made up of swiftly growing nations like China, Indonesia, Russia, Korea and Mexico and established economies such as Australia, Japan and the United States. These countries represent a weighty financial bloc. Together they make up 60 percent of the world's GDP, 33 percent of its population, 47 percent of its trade volume -- and, leaders hope, they will power the engines of the global recovery.\nWhen the G20 winded down on Friday a fragile consensus had been reached, an \"action plan\" for the globe's economy (albeit light on some of the detail). President Obama praised Europe's politicians. \"I think that there are going to be some ups and downs along the way,\" he said, according to CNN. \"But I am confident that the key players in Europe -- the European political leadership -- understand how much of a stake they have in making sure this crisis is resolved.\"\nAPEC takes up similar concerns on a broad platform. Its 21 nations will discuss the future of business and the role of technology. Globalization will be a dominant theme: how do we pursue a global solution to problems which, in an interconnected world, affect so many countries? Hillary Clinton will talk about the role of women in today's economy and the president of the United States, Barack Obama, will be interviewed on-stage by Boeing CEO, Jim McNerney. The great thing about APEC is that it creates an opportunity for world leaders to have a dialog with private businesses. From the private sector Eric Schmidt of Google, William C. Weldon of Johnson & Johnson and many other high caliber CEOs and chairmen will participate. They will explain what their firms can offer when it comes to science, technology and innovation.\nMy company, Richard Attias & Associates, is producing the summit on behalf of the National Committee APEC, which takes place from November 10-12 in Honolulu. We are proud to play a part in this gathering of world leaders. This is a pivotal moment in global history. As I have said in the past we need leadership from those we have elected to govern us more than ever before.\nFor that reason I hope that APEC be a fruitful ground for conversation, and a turning point for all of our interconnected economies.\nBarack Obama Hillary Clinton China Global Economy USA"

        "webpage": "Effort to Extend Estate Tax Fails\nLevy Set to Expire Jan. 1, Setting Up a Political Standoff; Democrats Promise New Push\nJohn D. McKinnon and Martin Vaughan Updated Dec. 17, 2009 12:01 a.m. ET\nWASHINGTON -- The federal estate tax will likely expire as scheduled Jan. 1, creating dilemmas for politicians of both parties and roiling tax planning for thousands of Americans. Senate Democratic leaders Wednesday failed in a last-ditch effort to pass a short-term extension to override the tax's expiration, a process put into motion during the Bush administration. That virtually ensures that the tax will disappear Jan. 1. Under 2001 tax legislation, the federal estate tax is set to disappear in 2010. If Congress does nothing, it pops back into effect in 2011, at the Clinton-era top rate of 55%, with a $1 million exclusion. Currently the top rate is 45%, with a $3.5 million exclusion. Most Democrats were pushing to extend the current rate permanently. Republicans, by contrast, support a 35% top rate and a $5 million exclusion as a second-choice substitute for a permanent repeal. Lawmakers already were promising Wednesday to revisit the issue early next year. One option is to pass a new tax retroactive to the beginning of 2010. \"It's a completely unacceptable situation,\" said Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D., N.D.), who led an unsuccessful effort in the House to extend the tax. He added that there was \"100% certainty that Congress will move to address this issue early\" in the new year. Republicans, meanwhile, cheered the impending repeal as a symbolic and substantive victory. \"I don't see a problem -- we aren't going to have an estate tax next year,\" said Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, a leading strategist on the issue. Mr. Kyl conceded the one-year repeal creates complexities for tax planners and agreed Congress will \"likely\" address the issue with new legislation in 2010. The political calculus for both sides will be dicey, however. Republicans believe they will have leverage next year for achieving their 35% rate, because Democrats must argue for a 45% rate at a time when the rate is zero. But at some point, Democrats believe they will gain the upper hand in bargaining. That is because Republicans, by resisting a deal on 45%, would risk allowing the rate to snap back to 55% in 2011 and beyond. Even if Congress moves quickly to pass an extension of the tax next year, there could be lingering confusion because of likely legal challenges, particularly if Congress attempts to make it retroactive to the beginning of the year. \"I just think it's outrageous that we've not provided guidance to upper- and upper-middle-class people so they can do proper planning,\" said Alan Rothschild Jr., a lawyer in Columbus, Ga., who is chairman-elect of the American Bar Association section on estates. The combination of depressed asset values and confusion over estate-tax rules, he added, \"has led a lot of people to sit on the sidelines when they should very aggressively be doing planning.\" Frank Blethen, publisher of the Seattle Times and a longtime critic of the estate tax, applauded the repeal and urged making it permanent, saying it could help local family-owned businesses add jobs. Some wealthy business people, including Warren Buffett, have favored an extension of the estate tax. Congress could also be spurred to action next year by a little-noticed provision of the 2001 bill. After the estate tax lapses, some people who inherit property and later sell it could find themselves paying higher capital-gains taxes. That is because they will have to figure their gain based on the price the decedent paid for the asset, instead of the value at the time it is transferred from the estate -- typically a much more generous basis for the recipient. House officials estimate that about 6,000 estates next year will get relief from the estate-tax repeal. But more than 70,000 would have new capital-gains liability from the provision on capital gains. \"The dirty little secret about the next chapter in estate-tax law is that more people will get a tax increase than a tax break,\" Mr. Pomeroy said.

        "webpage": "No Big Waves In The Labor Pool By Marilyn Geewax\nJun 7, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Shoppers walk along Broadway in New York City. Retailers added 28,000 in May amid signs of strength in consumer spending.\nOriginally published on June 7, 2013 11:44 am June is a nice month for treading water  -  if you happen to be in a swimming pool. But if you are in the labor pool and trying to make your way toward a job, a stronger current in the right direction would be appreciated. Unfortunately, the jobs report released Friday by the Labor Department showed that the economy continues to drift along at a languid pace. \"This rate of growth is right in line with the average growth rate of the last year and is a perfect example of the ongoing slog in the labor market,\" Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a research group, said in her written assessment. Four Years After The Recession The Labor Department report showed employers added 175,000 jobs in May, a slightly better number than most economists had been forecasting. But the unemployment rate ticked up a tenth of a point to 7.6 percent as more people entered the labor market, seeking paychecks but not finding them. The latest jobs report was issued at a time when the U.S. economy is marking the fourth anniversary of the official end of the Great Recession. The economy hit bottom in June 2009 and has been growing ever since, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Alan Krueger, head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, pointed out that steady improvement. \"The economy has now added private sector jobs every month for 39 straight months, and a total of 6.9 million jobs has been added over that period,\" he said in a statement. \"So far this year, 972,000 private sector jobs have been added.\" Digging Out Of A 'Deep Hole' But he also recognized that, with 11.8 million people still unemployed, things aren't exactly going swimmingly. \"We continue to dig our way out of the deep hole that was caused by the severe recession that began in December 2007,\" Krueger said. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement that the \"modest job growth is a positive sign,\" but he noted that \"millions of Americans have been out of work for more than several months, wages are stagnant, and the unemployment rate is still far higher than the Obama administration promised.\" Most economists and Wall Street investors were just glad the economy didn't do a spring swoon, as it has for the past three years. In those previous years, the economy would start the year fairly strong, then lose momentum in the spring. This year, the pace has held steady. Keeping The Fed On Hold? That steadiness bolstered confidence among investors, who interpreted the report as good news because it was neither strong enough to push the Federal Reserve to suddenly stop pumping money into the economy, nor weak enough to signal a looming recession. Most stock indexes moved up in the wake of the report. This latest employment report showed that private employers added 179,000 jobs last month, while the federal government cut 14,000 positions. Local governments added 13,000 jobs. The U.S. labor force grew by 420,000 in May, and average hourly wages nudged up 1 cent to $23.89. The average workweek held steady at 34.5 hours. Consumers have been helping the economy with additional spending, and that caused retailers to add 28,000 jobs while restaurants added 38,000. Because of growth in residential housing, construction companies added 7,000 jobs, but manufacturers pulled back, lopping off 8,000 jobs.Copyright 2014 NPR. To see more, visit . \u00a9 2016 KTEP"

HallMcClatchy Newspapers Published: Wednesday, April 10, 2013, 12:01 a.m. advertisement | your ad here\nWASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's coming push for less generous increases in Social Security benefits is angering his party and perplexing economists, many of whom question why he'd replace one ineffective measure with another.In his proposed federal budget Wednesday, Obama will urge a shift away from the way the government has calculated benefits for nearly four decades. It would save the government $230 billion over the next 10 years - which would please those alarmed by sky-high deficits and debt -- but do it by slowing the growth of benefits to the elderly and others -- a cause for alarm among his liberal base that thought his re-election meant such popular entitlements would continue untouched.Obama will propose to shelve the standard measure of inflation, the consumer price index calculated by the Labor Department, as the basis for automatically adjusting the size of Social Security checks.Instead, Obama wants what's called a \"chained\" consumer price index. This alternate way to calculate monthly Social Security benefits involves the assumption that consumers don't always pay higher prices, but rather respond by seeking less expensive alternatives.The net result is a less generous measure of inflation, which would save the federal government what it pays retirees, the disabled and others on assistance programs such as Social Security, some veterans benefits and other assistance programs. That weaker cost-of-living adjustment means less generous benefits for current and future retirees over the course of their retirement.\"That's not just malarkey, that's damn malarkey,\" Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, shouted during a small but spirited midday rally against the proposed change Tuesday in front of the White House.Social Security first paid monthly benefits in 1940. Congress voted to raise benefits in 1950 and again in 1952. Since 1975, the benefits have been adjusted annually based not on a vote of Congress, but on the annual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index.As a candidate and later when seeking re-election, Obama flatly rejected proposals to change the way benefits were increased. White House spokesman Jay Carney explained the about-face Tuesday by arguing that Obama's proposed budget in its entirety does a better job protecting seniors and the most vulnerable than do his opponents.What angers advocates for the elderly and disabled and surprises economists is that there's so little recognition that the existing and proposed cost-of-living adjustments largely overlook the real prices for seniors and the disabled.\"It's a backdoor benefit cut. It's not a more accurate measure of the costs facing seniors,\" said Monique Morrissey, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. \"If anything, the current (cost-of-living adjustment) underestimates inflation (faced by seniors).\"Here's how. Both the current and proposed gauges of inflation measure changes in prices for products and services purchased by the general population. As a subset of the general population, however, the elderly consume health care and a number of other goods and services very differently than the rest of us.\"It's a one-size-fits-everybody bundle,\" acknowledged Keith Hall, who served as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics from January 2008 to January 2012. \"Might you not want to focus on the elderly and some of their basics?\"During Hall's time at the BLS, statisticians developed an experimental model that tried to create a consumer price index for the elderly. It's known as the CPI-E, and while it is published monthly by the agency, it is only available through subscription and isn't included in publicly disseminated data.The effort remains a work in progress, being continued by Hall's successor. The consumer price index is put together by people around the country who go to stores and collect price information on thousands of commonly used products and services. They plug this information into a huge database that compares the changes in prices nationwide and regionally, and the collective effort results in the estimated rate of monthly inflation.\nWreckage of missing EgyptAir plane found California Senate approves sweeping gun-control measures\nMirrors blamed for fire at world\ufffds largest solar plant\nHillary Clinton: Trump is 'not qualified' to be President Oklahoma lawmakers OK bill criminalizing performing abortion\nVeteran \ufffd60 Minutes\ufffd newsman Morley Safer dies at 84\nCongress, White House strike rescue deal for Puerto Rico"

        "webpage": "Major banks are shells of what they were, and many are paying large settlements. | AP Photos\nHow Washington beat Wall Street\nBy Ben White\nNEW YORK  -  In 2009, Washington went to war against big Wall Street banks hoping to blow up the kind of high-risk, high-reward strategies that helped spark the financial crisis. Five years later, that war is largely over. And Washington won in a blowout. You might not know it given continued demands from Democrats  -  and even some Republicans  -  to further bust up the nation's largest banks. And the standard media refrain is that Wall Street titans always win, no big bank bosses went to jail and the industry will just find new ways to keep the casino open. Story Continued Below\nBut the truth on the ground  -  at least at this moment in time  -  is very different. ( Also on POLITICO: Obama lays out economic plan) Goldman Sachs, the biggest money machine in Wall Street history, is a shell of its former self. Morgan Stanley, Goldman's one-time bitter rival in the swashbuckling world of high-risk trading, is transforming into a staid money management firm with a side business underwriting stocks and offering merger advice. Citigroup and Bank of America sold off many of their classic \"Wall Street\" businesses, including proprietary trading desks and private equity and hedge fund stakes, to comply with the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill. Washington's big victory came via widespread public outrage at the financial industry, which paved the way for a strong reform bill. And after President Barack Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law in 2010, the industry made mistake after mistake  -  from the interest rate rigging scandal to mortgage-foreclosure \"robo-signing\"  -  making it essentially impossible for the industry's lobbyists to beat back any of the newly imposed regulations. \"The scope of activities that U.S. banks engage in has been dramatically reduced,\" said Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of giant bond fund manager Pimco, which itself may face new restrictions as regulators turn their attention to the asset management industry. \"Even in a period when markets are performing well, the numbers the banks are pulling in are just nowhere near as strong as they once were.\" ( Sign up for POLITICO's Morning Money tip sheet) Even mighty JPMorgan Chase, once viewed as the only bank to come through the crisis largely unchanged, is now forking over tens of billions of dollars in settlement cash, seemingly on a weekly basis, to pay for its sins before the financial crisis  -  including allegedly turning a blind eye to the Bernie Madoff fraud and improperly selling risky mortgage securities. JPMorgan this week gave up its coveted title as the nation's most profitable bank to Wells Fargo, a buttoned down San Francisco-based bank not known as a Wall Street titan. And JPMorgan's massive $6 billion loss in the so-called London whale trading scandal in 2012 helped ensure that a very tough version of the ban on proprietary trading by federally backstopped banks  -  known as the \"Volcker rule\"  -  was approved by regulators last month. The transformation of Wall Street is so complete that even some of the industry's loudest critics  -  rarely willing to give an inch  -  are prepared to declare at least partial victory, albeit with plenty of \"time will tell\" caveats and complaints about the industry pushing to underfund its regulators in the latest spending bill working its way through Congress. \"There is no question that many of the highest-risk activities, which happened to be the most profitable activities for Wall Street, are now at least reduced and often totally gone,\" said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, one of the most vocal pro-regulatory reform groups. \"They've had to exit hedge funds and private equity funds and they sold off any business with 'proprietary trading' on the door.\" ( Also on POLITICO: Full finance policy coverage) Those sales in part benefit smaller boutique investment banks not subject to the new rules as well as pure hedge fund and private equity firms that can snap up assets from the bigger players at low prices. It also means young talent now flows toward higher-paying private equity and hedge funds rather than the now more staid banks. Both Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse in recent months pitched themselves by saying junior staff should no longer come to the office on Saturdays, a hallmark of the old Wall Street. In fact, perhaps the clearest example of the transformation is Goldman, which on Thursday reported a 15 percent fourth-quarter drop in net revenue in its once dominant fixed income, currency and commodities business to $1.72 billion. For the year, Goldman earned a total of profit of $8.04 billion. In 2007, at the height of the last Wall Street boom, Goldman's trading wizards earned $4.89 billion in net revenue in the same business in the third quarter. And for the year in 2007, Goldman reported earnings of nearly $12 billion. Share on Facebook\nBen White  @morningmoneyben This story tagged under:"

        "webpage": "No Big Waves In The Labor Pool By Marilyn Geewax\nJun 7, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Shoppers walk along Broadway in New York City. Retailers added 28,000 in May amid signs of strength in consumer spending.\nOriginally published on June 7, 2013 1:44 pm June is a nice month for treading water  -  if you happen to be in a swimming pool. But if you are in the labor pool and trying to make your way toward a job, a stronger current in the right direction would be appreciated. Unfortunately, the jobs report released Friday by the Labor Department showed that the economy continues to drift along at a languid pace. \"This rate of growth is right in line with the average growth rate of the last year and is a perfect example of the ongoing slog in the labor market,\" Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a research group, said in her written assessment. Four Years After The Recession The Labor Department report showed employers added 175,000 jobs in May, a slightly better number than most economists had been forecasting. But the unemployment rate ticked up a tenth of a point to 7.6 percent as more people entered the labor market, seeking paychecks but not finding them. The latest jobs report was issued at a time when the U.S. economy is marking the fourth anniversary of the official end of the Great Recession. The economy hit bottom in June 2009 and has been growing ever since, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Alan Krueger, head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, pointed out that steady improvement. \"The economy has now added private sector jobs every month for 39 straight months, and a total of 6.9 million jobs has been added over that period,\" he said in a statement. \"So far this year, 972,000 private sector jobs have been added.\" Digging Out Of A 'Deep Hole' But he also recognized that, with 11.8 million people still unemployed, things aren't exactly going swimmingly. \"We continue to dig our way out of the deep hole that was caused by the severe recession that began in December 2007,\" Krueger said. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement that the \"modest job growth is a positive sign,\" but he noted that \"millions of Americans have been out of work for more than several months, wages are stagnant, and the unemployment rate is still far higher than the Obama administration promised.\" Most economists and Wall Street investors were just glad the economy didn't do a spring swoon, as it has for the past three years. In those previous years, the economy would start the year fairly strong, then lose momentum in the spring. This year, the pace has held steady. Keeping The Fed On Hold? That steadiness bolstered confidence among investors, who interpreted the report as good news because it was neither strong enough to push the Federal Reserve to suddenly stop pumping money into the economy, nor weak enough to signal a looming recession. Most stock indexes moved up in the wake of the report. This latest employment report showed that private employers added 179,000 jobs last month, while the federal government cut 14,000 positions. Local governments added 13,000 jobs. The U.S. labor force grew by 420,000 in May, and average hourly wages nudged up 1 cent to $23.89. The average workweek held steady at 34.5 hours. Consumers have been helping the economy with additional spending, and that caused retailers to add 28,000 jobs while restaurants added 38,000. Because of growth in residential housing, construction companies added 7,000 jobs, but manufacturers pulled back, lopping off 8,000 jobs.Copyright 2014 NPR. To see more, visit .

        "webpage": "Nocera on the Financial Crisis Commission's Report\nJoe Nocera, writing in the New York Times, makes comments on the Financial Crisis Commission's report not dissimilar to my own:\nThe F.C.I.C. is the first to take a close look at the missteps at Citigroup, which virtually every book about the financial crisis has overlooked. It is a devastating portrait of negligence at the top  -  including the once sainted Robert Rubin. It homes in on the unconscionable willingness of federal regulators to look the other way at destructive subprime lending practices. It digs into A.I.G., Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Moody's, the Federal Reserve, Countrywide, Ameriquest and others. It's a very long list. Which is also one of its key weaknesses: the report has a kitchen sink quality that actually detracts from our ability to truly understand why the crisis took place. In their joint dissent, the three Republican commissioners complain that the report \"is more an account of bad events than a focused explanation of what happened and why. When everything is important, nothing is.\"\nHe also takes the minority's report to task:\nYet the Republican 30,000-foot view of the crisis has its own drawback: it's so bloodless it's almost as if they are saying nobody is responsible for the bad things that took place in the years leading up to the crisis. When I spoke to Keith Hennessey, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and one of the co-authors of the Republican dissent, he told me that he and the other Republicans agreed with many of the investigative thrusts of the final reports. (It didn't help that the Republicans had only 27 pages to express their views, compared to the Democrats' 500-plus pages.) The question, he said, wasn't whether there were bad actors or fraudulent practices  -  \"of course there were, and they did awful things,\" he said  -  but whether the particular actions of particular people had been the primary reasons for the financial crisis. \"If you take that view, then you are saying that the crisis was foreseeable and preventable. I think the real answer is: we don't know,\" Mr. Hennessey said.\nAs I've been trying to explain I do think that the crisis was foreseeable and preventable, I think that those in a position to foresee and prevent it were regulators and the Congress, and distracting from that reduces our ability to prevent a recurrence rather than enhancing it.\nMr. Nocera skewers the minority minority report:\n...Peter Wallison, the American Enterprise Institute scholar and the fourth Republican F.C.I.C. commissioner, had already released his own, one-man dissent  -  a lonely, loony cri de coeur that placed the blame for the financial crisis entirely on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and federal home ownership policies, a position so contrary to the facts that even his fellow Republican commissioners did not agree with him.\nHis conclusion dovetails pretty nicely with mine:\nBut mass delusions, alas, are part of the human condition, and no report, no matter how scathing, is going to change that.\nI emphatically do not believe by that that I blame the victims. I have no objection to pursuing civil and criminal cases against bankers where there is actual wrongdoing. Indeed, I believe these things should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I also believe that the Congress and regulators hold positions of trust that go beyond getting re-elected or landing that cushy job at Goldman Sachs. If consumers behave badly, it's a problem. If Congress and regulators behave badly, it's a violation of their offices.\nToo bad financial oversight is impossible in a culture as diverse as ours.\nlolz, it's not like we're Danes! or anything.\nBut isn't the nature of a bubble just that the delusion prevents the foresight? Nocera's point is that everybody was delusional, and that includes the regulators: \"That's what bubbles are: they're examples of mass delusions.\" Maybe what's really needed in the regulatory agencies is a cadre of historians.\nAs the bubble blew in California the market shifted to more and more interest-only loans, and NINJA loans.\nYou don't have to count on bubble-spotting to fix that. You only have to watch the industry go mad.\nBTW, an interesting idea is developing, that the Brits"

It's about people struggling to make ends meet,\" said Sendhil Mullainathan, a Harvard economist and study co-author. \"When we think about people who are financially stressed, we think they are short on money, but the truth is they are also short on cognitive capacity.\"If you are always thinking about overdue bills, a mortgage or rent, or college loans, it takes away from your focus on other things. So being late on loans could end up costing you both interest points and IQ points, Mullainathan said.The study used tests that studied various aspects of thinking including a traditional IQ test, getting the 13 IQ point drop, said study co-author Jiaying Zhao, a professor of psychology and sustainability at the University of British Columbia.The scientists looked at the effects of finances on the brain both in the lab and in the field. In controlled lab-like conditions, they had about 400 shoppers at Quaker Bridge Mall in central New Jersey consider certain financial scenarios and tested their brain power. Then they looked at real life in the fields of India, where farmers only get paid once a year. Before the harvest, they take out loans and pawn goods. After they sell their harvest, they are flush with cash.Mullainathan and colleagues tested the same 464 farmers before and after the harvest and their IQ scores improved by 25 percent when their wallets fattened.\"It's a very powerful effect,\" said study co-author Eldar Shafir, a Princeton University psychology professor. \"When you are dealing with budgetary finances, it does intrude on your thinking. It's at the top of your mind.\"In the New Jersey part of the study, the scientists tested about 400 shoppers, presenting them with scenarios that involved a large and a small car repair bill. Those with family incomes of about $20,000 scored about the same as those with $70,000 incomes on IQ tests when the car bill was small. But when the poorer people had to think about facing a whopping repair bill, their IQ scores were 40 percent lower.Education differences can't be a major factor because the poor only scored worse when they were faced with big bills, Safir said. The more educated rich may have learned to divide their attention, but that wouldn't be a significant factor, he said.The study's authors and others say the results contradict long-standing conservative economic social and political theory that say it is individuals  -  not circumstances  -  that are the primary problem with poverty. In the case of India, it was the same people before and after, so it can't be the person's fault.\"For a long time we've been blaming the poor for their own failings,\" Zhao said. \"We're arguing something very different.\"Poverty researcher Kathryn Edin of Harvard, who wasn't part of the study, said the research \"is a big deal that solves a critical puzzle in poverty research.\"She said poor people often have the same mainstream values about marriage and two-parent families as everyone else, but they don't seem to act that way. This shows that it's not their values but the situation that impairs their decision-making, she said."

Now, as the massive cleanup begins, business owners, workers and investors are wondering what impact the megastorm ultimately will have on their wallets. Did Sandy weigh down economic activity enough to drown the recovery? Or will the rebuilding efforts boost growth over the longer term? Economists say Sandy's negative effects will be huge, but the U.S. economy is enormous. On Tuesday, the emerging view held that once all of the costs are counted up, Sandy will have had a big and bad impact, but not one large enough to reverse the slow-moving recovery. IHS Global Insight, a forecasting firm, estimates that the megastorm's costs  -  including interruption of business activity and damage to infrastructure  -  will total $30 billion to $50 billion. That's a big number, but much lower than the one for Hurricane Katrina, which caused around $120 billion in damages. And on a national scale, $30 billion to $50 billion in economic losses would represent just about 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent of gross domestic product. That would knock the economy's current 2 percent growth rate back to where it was this summer, but it would not kill the recovery. In such a listless economy, where roughly 12 million people are seeking work, that dip would be unwelcome. \"The effect on growth for the fourth quarter will not be catastrophic but might still be noticeable, especially in an economy with little momentum anyway,\" IHS economists Gregory Daco and Nigel Gault wrote in their analysis of Sandy's impact. Without question, the storm's rampage will be a huge negative for millions of individuals, from cruise operators to waiters who will never get the tips lost during the storm and subsequent power outages. Here are some estimates for the storm's negative impact: -- As of Tuesday morning, about 8.1 million customers were without power in the affected areas, the U.S. Department of Energy said. That means millions of people couldn't get ready for work in the morning, or their place of employment was shut down. -- IHS said Sandy idled about 70 percent of the East Coast's oil refineries, and with supplies already tight before the storm, gasoline prices could go up. But oil futures were little changed Tuesday afternoon and gasoline futures sank on speculation that the storm will cut demand as drivers stayed home and businesses were closed, Bloomberg News reported. But a megastorm can also have positive impacts as rebuilding begins. Here are some potential upsides: -- Roughly $10 billion in public infrastructure was damaged, the IHS economists estimated. That means state and local governments will have to hire more workers  -  or give them longer hours  -  to repair the roads, bridges, beaches and airports that were damaged. -- And widespread power outages mean that grocery stores will see a short-term benefit once residents restock their refrigerators after throwing out spoiled food. And that's on top of the supplies people bought to get ready before the storm hit.Copyright 2013 NPR. To see more, visit . KCCU"

        "webpage": "The Language You Use Might Save You Money\nHeard on Weekend Edition Sunday\nEconomic professor Keith Chen talks with host Rachel Martin about his research on the correlations between language and behavior  -  specifically about the relationship between \"strong future tense\" and savings.\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The language we speak affects much of how we understand the world, and probably in more ways than you think. Keith Chen is a professor of economics at UCLA, and he's been studying some examples of this. He's found that the way language is structured can influence our eating habits, our likelihood of smoking, even the way we spend or save our money. Keith Chen, welcome to the program.\nKEITH CHEN: Thank you. It's exciting to be here.\nMARTIN: So explain how this works.\nCHEN: Broken down, what it really, really comes down to is that languages differ to the degree that they force you, when you speak them, to pay attention to the difference between the future and the present. In English, we have the past tense - \"I ran\"; we have the present progressive - \"I'm running\"; but we don't have a future form - \"rin\" - right? There's no kind of future \"run.\" But we do have kind of a necessary obligatory form - \"we will run.\" OK. I can't say, \"tomorrow, it rain.\" Right? I have to say \"tomorrow, it will rain.\"\nMARTIN: OK...\nCHEN: So flip all the way to the other side. And there are languages - many, many languages - on the planet which are effectively futureless. So languages like Finnish, and languages like Mandarin and Chinese - you literally, in Mandarin and Chinese, say, \"It rain tomorrow.\" So the critical difference here is whether when you're speaking a particular language, it forces you every time you're thinking about a future event. to note in your head and to speak as if that future is something viscerally and grammatically different than the present.\nMARTIN: What does that say about our habits?\nCHEN: When people speak a futureless language, they talk about future events as if they're the present. If your grammar puts the future and the present on equal footing, it appears as if you're more willing to put the future and the present on equal footing in your decision-making. And that kind of subtle distinction, my research shows, appears to have kind of psychological effects as well. Countries whose languages grammatically associate the future and the present, save almost 5 percent more of their GDP per year. And that's over great swaths of time.\nMARTIN: So what are the practical implications of this research?\nCHEN: I think this research is not yet at the stage where I can say, you know, if you use the future tense, you know, 20 percent less, then you're going to save X percent more.\nMARTIN: Shoot.\nCHEN: I know. shoot - although I would point out that a lot of self-help gurus, not only do they suggest that in order to meet goals you should write down lists of goals that you're trying to kind of aspire to, but that you should actually write them down in the present tense. You know, as a behavioral economist, what I'm mainly doing is using this type of research to try and explore the degree to which kind of subtly, language can impact how we think about these very difficult and abstract problems that we're faced with all the time. I'm trying to eventually deepen our understanding of that process and then hopefully, eventually help us make better decisions.\nMARTIN: Keith Chen - he is a professor of economics at UCLA. Thank you so much for talking with us.\nCHEN: Thank you, Rachel. It's been a pleasure.\nMARTIN: This is NPR News.\nWatch: A Slow-Motion Sneeze Looks A Lot Like Breathing Fire\nJapanese City Takes Community Approach To Dealing With Dementia\nBeyond Slurpees: Many Japanese Mini-Marts Now Cater To Elders"

However, the same advantages that drive investment and growth in these areas also draw migrants who need jobs and housing, lead to demands for better infrastructure and social services, and result in increased congestion, environmental damage, and social problems.Governments in developing countries face two key challenges: how to capture a share of the economic growth to finance the needed expenditures, and how to manage cities so that the urban economy functions efficiently, services are delivered cost-effectively to all, and citizens have a voice in governing the city.This report identifies the critical issues and describes current practice, the gap between practice and theory, and potential reform paths. Two core issues are explored: how to manage complex vertical and horizontal urban governance structures, and how to raise the finances to promote efficient, equitable, and sustainable metropolitan growth. The report explores local revenue instruments, with a focus on property-based local taxes and user charges, as well as external revenue sources such as intergovernmental transfers, borrowing, public-private partnerships, and international assistance.In the 50-plus metropolitan cities considered here, practice often deviates widely from theory and varies greatly across cities. Therefore, it is impossible to make sweeping recommendations for all countries and cities.Three general conclusions may be drawn:\u2022 Metropolitan-wide plans for service delivery and financing should be an essential part of national fiscal planning, even if this approach results in some loss of home rule at the lowest levels of metropolitan government.\u2022 Metropolitan local governments need more discretion over their budgets, service delivery, and financing decisions.\u2022 Many developing countries need to adopt asymmetric systems of intergovernmental fiscal relations, in which the metropolitan areas are given differential powers and responsibilities relative to other subnational jurisdictions.Some recommendations can guide national and local authorities, as well as external donors and advisors:\u2022 Take a long view. Change will take time, perseverance, and courage to make hard political choices.\u2022 Understand the history, institutions, and political economy of each country and city.\u2022 Develop a comprehensive perspective of the governance and fiscal conditions in each country and city.\u2022 Allow for the great differences in capacity between low- and middle-income developing countries and their cities, but do not underestimate the institutional capacity of metropolitan areas in low-income countries.\u2022 Encourage the central government to focus on metropolitan governance and finance.\u2022 Pay attention to effective governance (to function, finance, and functionaries) and to the triad of autonomy, accountability, and capacity, in the right sequence.\u2022 Put in place the right financial instruments.\u2022 Influence aid donors to pay attention to, and invest in, metropolitan areas.This report was preceded by the book Financing Metropolitan Governments in Developing Countries, by Bahl, Linn, and Deborah L. Wetzel, country director for Brazil at the World Bank. The research has been the basis for a webinar series on governance and finance produced by the World Bank.About the AuthorsRoy W.

He is the author of The Geopolitics of Emotion: How Cultures of Fear, Humiliation, and Hope are Reshaping the World.\nThe European Oasis\nPARIS - Are non-Europeans much less pessimistic about Europe than Europeans themselves? Could distance be a prerequisite for a more balanced view of the continent's predicament?In an interview a few months ago, Wang Hongzhang, the chairman of China Construction Bank, indirectly expressed his subdued enthusiasm for Europe. Quoting the Chinese proverb, \"A starved camel is still bigger than a horse,\" he went on to say that Europe's economies are much stronger than many people believe. And, without saying so explicitly, he suggested that the time was right to go on a European buying spree at the right price.Of course, not everyone would share this optimistic vision. Across the English Channel, British Euroskeptics rejoice that they have kept their distance from a \"sinking ship.\" But, while The Economist recently described France as being \"in denial,\" the same could be said of the United Kingdom. True, the French had neither the Olympic Games nor a royal celebration this year; but, when it comes to the state of their economies, the two countries are largely in the same boat.If one travels to America or Asia, as I did this autumn, Europe's image becomes selectively brighter: while it continues to be perceived as a positive model, it is no longer considered a global actor. Seen from the United States, Europe may no longer be a problem, but it is not considered a part of any solution to the world's problems, either - with the possible exception of those that concern Europe directly (and, even then, doubts linger).Yet, for many international investors, Europe continues to be, or is once again, a risk worth taking, if not - as in the case of Wang - a golden opportunity. In a time of growing complexity - and thus uncertainty - investors want to hedge their bets. At least some of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) appear to be running out of steam economically; and, while new emerging powers, such as Mexico, are tempting, they may prove to be more fragile than they look.In this context, Europe may be a tired, aging, and depressed continent, but, as its luxury and aeronautics industries attest, it would be premature to bury it. Relative decline is obvious: Europe accounted for 20% of the world's population at the beginning of the eighteenth century, but only around 7% today, while its share is expected to be even lower in 2050. But demography is not destiny: a small population has not prevented Singapore from sustaining a hyper-competitive economy.Europe may not be a source of economic inspiration, but it still makes people dream. It is perceived as a model of \"civility.\" Whatever their other disagreements, Chinese and Japanese concur on one point: if Asia today, with its rising nationalist tensions, evokes Europe in the first half of the twentieth century, it is precisely because Asia has not embarked on a reconciliation process such as that which enabled France and Germany to transcend their centuries-old rivalry.Likewise, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, may emphasize the specificity of \"Russian civilization\" in a manner evocative of nineteenth-century anti-Western thinkers; but many in the Russian elite still consider the European Union, despite its many weaknesses, the most civilized model of governance that exists. When Chinese seek a benchmark model for social protection, they go on study trips to Scandinavia.But can Europe remain a model if it is no longer a serious geopolitical actor? When US officials say to the Europeans, \"We need you,\" what they mean is quite minimal: \"Please do not collapse and bring down the global economy with you.\" Europeans have become the Japanese of the West - financial contributors who at best play a supporting role in global strategic affairs.For example, if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can still be resolved, a solution can come only with strong US involvement. Barack Obama, who wants to be a transformative president like his role model, Abraham Lincoln, could do worse to deserve the Nobel Peace Prize that he received prematurely than to facilitate a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement. Few expect such a colossal achievement, of course, but far fewer expect anything remotely similar from Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy czarina, or, for that matter, any European leader.Europe remains a significant economic and commercial actor - one that can rebound at any time, now that it has at least partly transcended its systemic crisis. It also remains a model of reconciliation in which people can continue to dream, despite unacceptably high levels of unemployment, particularly among the young.But Europe is no longer perceived as a global actor - and rightly so. It is an oasis of peace, if not dynamism. The question for Europeans today is whether they can - and, more important, should - be content with their status.\n\n\u00a9 1995-2015 Project Syndicate"

        "webpage": "Americans have long been taught to view the federal government as a parent. While the government is sometimes abusive to American child-adults (e.g., IRS, DEA, torture, Waco, etc.), Americans know that that's a trait that is common to many parents. What matters in life under a paternalistic regime is people's unwavering faith in the government to watch over them and take care of them, just as parents do with their children.\n\nThis is the idea behind such paternalistic welfare-state programs as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment compensation, food stamps, corporate subsidies, and education grants. The parent  -  the federal government  -  takes care of the child-adult and ensures that no harm will befall him.\n\nIn return, the child-adult can be counted on to support the government in times of crisis or trouble, without asking too many questions as to the causes or consequences of the crises. Not only is the child ordinarily too frightened to challenge a parent who has life-or-death power over him, there is also a tremendous amount of loyalty and devotion that arises from this type of co-dependent relationship.\n\nThe co-dependency between the child-adult and his paternalistic government encourages the child-adult to feel that everything is okay because the government  -  his parent  -  is in charge of things. A good example of this phenomenon occurs here in the United States with respect to the banking system.\n\nAs I indicated in blog entries last month (July 14 and July 25), Americans have been taught to believe that the federal government is insuring the money they keep in banks. As most everyone knows, the federal agency responsible for this \"insurance\" is the FDIC. As I indicated in those blog entries, as long as it's just a few banks that fail, no problem. The FDIC simply takes its \"insurance\" reserves and pays off the depositors.\n\nBut as I asked in last month's blog entries, what happens if there is an industry-wide banking collapse? What then? The average American child-adult would rather not think about that. After all, what child wants to think about the frightening possibility that his parents are going to be unable to take care of him or that they've misled him.\n\nAnyway, what are the chances of that happening? Everyone knows that the federal government has more than enough money to take care of all its obligations, right? Iraq. Afghanistan. Georgia. Overseas military bases and hundreds more here in the U.S. An ever-growing welfare system and warfare system. Wars on terrorism, drugs, immigrants, and poverty. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, grants, and subsidies. And on and on.\n\nWhat's the problem, right? Well, consider this report issued this morning on MSNBC.com that indicates that the FDIC \"insurance\" fund is nearly broke and that the FDIC might have to \"borrow\" money from the Treasury (which gets its money from some place) to cover future losses of depositors' money:\n\n\"Those [9 bank] failures have depleted the insurance fund, which now stands at $45 billion  -  less than the FDIC is supposed to have on hand, according to Daniel Alpert, an investment banker at Westwood Capital. 'You're talking about roughly $45 billion of reserves insuring $4.5 trillion of deposits,' he said. 'And you're in an environment right now where non-current loans, delinquent loans are increasing at a faster pace than banks putting aside reserves. That's not a good thing.'\"\n\nNow, MSNBC goes out of its way to alleviate concerns among people, reminding them that the FDIC provides them with \"insurance\" that protects up to $100,000 in deposits, an amount that has steadily increased over the years.\n\nBut I repeat the question I asked in last month's blog posts on this subject: What if there is an industry-wide banking collapse? Where does the federal government get the money to pay off all the depositors in all the banks? It's a question that no co-dependent child-adult living in a paternalistic welfare-warfare state wishes to ask, much less think about it. That's the job of the government. That's the job of the parent.\n\nShare This Article\n\nJacob G. Hornberger is founder and president of The Future of Freedom Foundation.

        "webpage": "Guest Opinion: Overseas tax havens create uneven playing field By Pam Hausner\nCongress likes to talk about how much it loves small business. After all, the vast majority of businesses in the US are small businesses, and the jobs we create are vital to the economy. But based on what we see from our legislators, it's easy to question whether they really do.\nI co-own a marketing agency in Kansas City. We are a relationship-building, media-intensive consulting agency obsessed with empowering local businesses to become irreplaceable in their communities. We were the first Certified B Corp in Kansas City and have co-founded a nonprofit for other locally owned businesses that are serious about taking responsibility for their impact. Integrity and transparency are key values in how we conduct our business.\nLike most smaller businesses, ours is dependent on the economic well-being of the local and regional economy. Unfortunately, Kansas City as a whole is still not back to pre-recession revenue levels. The ability for us to serve clients is inextricably linked to their ability to pay for marketing. And with the federal government being the biggest employer in the region, we've also been hit hard by the sequester.\nKansas City has made some great progress in high-tech and engineering job growth compared to other cities, and I'm grateful for the strong entrepreneurial community that continues to grow here. Much of the recent growth is due to private investment. But despite the progres, my daily conversations with business owners makes it very clear they are struggling.\nMore government investment in local communities could accelerate growth in hi-tech, engineering, and entrepreneurialism as well as other regional business growth.\nWhere could the money come from? As it turns out, there's lots of money being handed to U.S. multinational companies in overseas tax subsidies and loopholes. Conservative estimates put the total loss at $100 billion per year. Kansas City's regional share of that would be a substantial annual boost to STEM education in the area. It could also be invested in infrastructure improvements that all businesses rely on and that are a continual source of concern here.\nPeople tend not to think of it, but there are other public goods that all businesses use and need in order to be successful. America has the most stable economic system in the world. Our legal system protects us from an economy based on bribery. Financial transactions are regulated to varying degree to protect against wild manipulations of the system. All businesses benefit from this stability and all should pay their fair share to support it.\nBut when one five-story building in the Cayman Islands ends up being the \"home\" to 19,000 companies, or highly profitable companies like GE, Apple, and Johnson and Johnson can trim their tax bill by moving funds overseas, it's clear the system is flawed.\nI feel the impact from this every day. The inability to compete with big corporations drunk on tax loopholes and incentives unattainable to most small businesses is leaving its smelly breath all over Kansas City. It affects the work I'm unable to get from the tax-paying small business owners with razor thin margins that can barely make payroll, often without a regular salary of their own.\nMost small business owners agree with me. According to polling by the American Sustainable Business Council, 90 percent of small business owners see hiding profits offshore to avoid paying a fair tax share is a serious problem. This is no surprise. Many of us started our businesses from scratch, working long hours to win customers and grow. There were no short cuts for us.\nA level playing field is all we want. Small business owners don't shy away from competition; we thrive on it. But when the rules are rigged against us, that's not a fair fight.\nWe need to change the laws, and we need to enforce them. Missouri's congressional delegation should stand up for competition and a level playing field. Let's increase funding for investments to boost our economy by making it illegal for companies to use tax havens to avoid their fair share of taxes.\nPam Hausner is CEO of Big Vision Media Group LLC in Kansas City, Mo."

        "webpage": "Robert J. Samuelson: Is the dollar becoming unstable on global scale?\nBy Robert J. Samuelson , Washington Post Published: Tuesday, May 28 2013 12:00 a.m. MDT\nWASHINGTON  -  For years, the dollar's role as the major global currency has been termed an \"exorbitant privilege\"  -  a phrase coined by French Finance Minister and later President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Now it may be turning into an extravagant curse. The United States wants export-led growth. So do most other countries. Not all can succeed; one country's export surplus must be others' deficits. But the dollar's global role puts the United States at a special disadvantage. It's one cause of slow American growth and high joblessness. The dollar serves as the world's money because it's used for cross-border trade and investment transactions not involving the United States. Before the Great Depression, this role was played by gold and some currencies backed by gold (mainly the British pound, French franc and dollar). Countries abandoned the gold standard in the 1930s, and after World War II, other nations lacked the economic power and political stability for their currencies to assume a large international role. By default, the dollar became the global currency.\nIn his book \"Exorbitant Privilege,\" economist Barry Eichengreen of the University of California at Berkeley provides figures. Government central banks hold about 60 percent of their foreign exchange reserves in dollars. About half of international debt securities are contracted in dollars. Oil, wheat and many commodities are denominated in dollars. South Korea and Thailand invoice about 80 percent of their exports in dollars, though only 20 percent go to the United States. They're not alone.\nA global currency needs two qualities: trust and usefulness. People  -  government officials, money managers, business executives, consumers  -  have to believe the money will hold its value and that other people will routinely accept it. The greatest threat to the dollar's international role occurred in the 1970s when high inflation, averaging 10 percent from 1977 to 1981, undermined America's commitment to a stable currency. With inflation conquered in the 1980s, confidence returned. Dollars can be converted into most currencies. They can be easily invested in U.S. stocks, bonds and real estate or parked in relatively safe U.S. Treasury securities.\nNo other money offers so much. China's renminbi (RMB) has one large use: buying Chinese goods. Otherwise, China regulates money flows in and out of RMB. Although the euro is more versatile, it has drawbacks. Europe's stock and bond markets aren't as deep as America's. And the euro crisis has made European government bonds riskier than U.S. Treasuries. The \"exorbitant privilege\" is that the United States can pay for imports with its own currency. By contrast, most countries have to earn dollars or euros by exporting. If exports lag, they have to suppress economic growth to curb imports. The United States is spared this indignity; it can create more dollars. In addition, foreigners' investment of their dollars holds down U.S. interest rates. But there was always a price. Foreigners didn't spend all their dollars on imports. Their demand for dollars kept the dollar's exchange rate up, making U.S. exports more expensive and imports here cheaper. Since 1980, the U.S. has run trade deficits in every year totaling about $9 trillion. All this produced grumbling from U.S. manufacturers and unions but was tolerated while most countries, including the United States, enjoyed relatively low unemployment. No more. It's not just joblessness. Many Americans believe that foreigners have manipulated their currencies to enshrine their export advantage. In a recent lecture, economist Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute, relying on the work of his colleague Joe Gagnon, argued that at least 20 countries have regularly intervened in foreign exchange markets by buying dollars and euros \"to keep those currencies overly strong and their own currencies weak, to boost their international competitiveness and trade surpluses.\" The resulting buildup of foreign exchange reserves is immense. At year-end 2012, China had $3.4 trillion of reserves; Japan, $1.2 trillion; Singapore, $519 billion; and Russia, $476 billion. One result is lopsided and weak global growth. Countries dependent on exports (China) need stronger domestic demand; countries dependent on domestic demand (the United States, some eurozone nations) need stronger exports.\nBergsten contends that the world trading system has already succumbed to \"currency wars\" as countries vie for competitive advantage. He proposes that the United States retaliate against \"manipulators.\" His suggestions, if adopted, would sow wider economic conflict. Some foreign governments view the Federal Reserve's easy money policies as retaliation, designed to depress the dollar's value, though the Fed denies this.\nThe global dollar poses other hazards. Eichengreen writes that either a political dispute between the United States and China or a \"sudden shift in market sentiment\" could trigger a panicky flight from the dollar. The odds of that are impossible to calculate. But this much is clear: Long a boon to the world economy, the dollar standard now looms as a potential source of instability.\nRober J.

Make Your Working Capital Work\nWorking capital management involves balancing a host of tradeoffs. Top companies integrate these considerations into both day-to-day operations and long-term decision-making.\nBy Meg Waters August 7, 2014 \u2022 Reprints\nLittle has changed in companies' working capital management over the past year - which means that companies have a huge opportunity for improvement. This is the key take-away from this year's \"2014 U.S. Working Capital Survey\" from REL, a division of The Hackett Group.\nIn this year's iteration of the annual study, REL and CFO Magazine analyzed the 2013 financial statements of the 1,000 largest public companies that have U.S.-based headquarters and are not in the financial services sector (the \"REL 1000\"). They separated the companies into industry groupings, then organized them into quartiles within each industry in terms of days inventory on hand (DIO), days sales outstanding (DSO), and days payables outstanding (DPO). For every company outside the top quartile in one of these metrics, REL and CFO calculated how much additional cash the organization would have available if it improved efficiency enough in its inventory, accounts receivable, or accounts payable processes to bring the associated metric in line with the level achieved by the top quartile of businesses in its industry.\nThis analysis revealed that the total opportunity for improving working capital among the 1,000 companies in the study is $1.020 trillion - which separates into a total accounts receivable (A/R) opportunity of $331 billion, a total accounts payable (A/P) opportunity of $266 billion, and a total inventory opportunity of $423 billion.\nThe study also found that cash on hand increased 12 percent among the REL 1000 from 2012 to 2013, although as a percentage of revenue, cash on hand remained static at 8 percent. Debt also increased, up 8 percent year-over-year and 26 percent over a three-year period. \"What we are seeing is that companies are still using the low interest rates, as they have been for the past couple of years, to have access to cash flow,\" says Analisa DeHaro, an associate principal in REL's working capital practice. \"They've been utilizing the low interest rates to different extents depending on whether they're top performers or in the lower tiers. Now we're looking at how companies are going to fund their capital improvements when interest rates start to rise.\"\nBalancing Working Capital Tradeoffs\nEventually, when rates increase, companies will have to fund capital expenditures using cash generated through operations. According to the REL/CFO study, the top performers are already doing that by optimizing their working capital management.\n\"We work with a lot of companies that are looking at the tradeoffs between the different elements of working capital and also costs,\" DeHaro says. \"They're figuring out which drivers they can actually impact and identifying areas of opportunity. Over the last several years, a lot of companies have been looking to extend payment terms on the supplier side. They've been going through rounds of payment-terms extensions. And now many companies are looking at other ways to improve cash flow.\"\nObviously, as companies extend their payment terms on the A/P side, that affects the receivables of their suppliers. \"Companies that are being impacted with their own DSO are looking at how they can mitigate that through their own payables,\" DeHaro says. \"And similarly, if they're looking at expanding inventory, they're figuring out how to make tradeoffs with payables that can mitigate the costs.\"\nThe net result of these calculations, according to the REL/CFO study, is that days working capital - which is trade receivables plus inventory, minus accounts payable, divided by one day's worth of revenue - remained essentially flat in 2013; it fell by 0.3 days, from 34.2 in 2012 to 33.9 in 2013 (see Figure 1, on page 2). But that doesn't mean companies' working capital practices are identical to a year ago.\nIn fact, the study provides eviden"

The first event in the series was held in Malaysia last October and the next will be held in London, this demand reflects the growing international interest in the subject. Aziz Tayyebi, the ACCA's Head of International Development who is also an expert in Islamic finance, said: \"Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs) are being set up in various countries including South Korea and Ireland and conventional multinational firms are also increasingly offering Shariah-compliant products. This is why we need a platform such as this, with some of the leading stakeholders in international Islamic finance, to address some fundamental questions around the topic of Islamic finance.\" Some of the questions that will be under consideration by the expert panel in Dubai will include\n\u00b7 Should the objectives of the financial reporting of Islamic financial transactions be different from those of mainstream financial reporting?\n\u00b7 Should Islamic Finance use distinct Islamic accounting principles to provide a faithful representation of the nature of these transactions?\n\u00b7 Do non-financial institutions that use Islamic finance products have different accounting issues to IFIs?\nSamer Hijazi, KPMG Audit Director and an expert in Islamic finance, noted: \"As the Islamic finance sector matures and becomes increasingly mainstream, greater synergy of practices and transparency of institutions that sell Shariah-compliant products will become critical.\" Muhammad Tariq, KPMG's Head of Islamic Finance in the UAE, added:\"It is timely to review the current financial reporting practices across the globe and to address the issues which might prevent a consistent internationalised approach, with all the benefits that we have seen in the development of IFRS\".\nGuests for the roundtable which is to be held at the Emirates Tower Hotel in Dubai, will include Wayne Upton, director of international activities, IASB, MNCs, global and local banks.\nTogether these distinguished panellists will not only discuss the wider issues related to harmonising financial reporting practices for Islamic finance, there will also be some specific questions addressed at the forum, aimed at the compatibility of IFRS with Islamic Finance practices: \u00b7 Does the prohibition of taking part in interest-based transactions influence the increasing use of discount rates for measuring the market value of financial instruments? \u00b7 Are concepts such as 'control', 'risks and rewards' and 'rights and obligations' - essential in determining accounting treatment under IFRS?\n\u00b7 Are the treatments of various types of profit-sharing investment accounts under IFRS consistent with the Shari'a basis for those transactions?\nThe ACCA is the global body for professional accountants.

        "webpage": "Politics of a crisis\nThere were easily more TV crews out looking for queues at Northern Rock yesterday than actual queues. As they opened for trade, only four branches had lines outside - and they were small. The number of phone calls to the bank was a tenth of what it had been on Monday. Even the website seemed to be working.\nSo the panic appears to be over. Alistair Darling's last-resort guarantee of all deposits with the Rock has calmed customers down. But what toll has a dramatic U-turn in policy, made after a long weekend of confusion, taken on the chancellor and his government? There can be no doubt that this episode has caused some political damage. What began as private-sector plight - one bank's shortage of funds - ballooned into an embarrassment for the government because it failed to respond decisively with sufficient speed. Indeed it was often painfully apparent just how new Mr Darling is to his job. Even yesterday afternoon, a day after the chancellor's announcement, there was confusion over the extent of his guarantee, or even whether it would be enshrined in law. Some officials admitted they just did not know. This really has been government on the hoof: not only is the ink not dry on this policy - whole chunks of it are yet to be written.\nDespite appearances, ministers and officials' actions have been reasonably consistent. Mervyn King, the head of the Bank of England, made it clear there would be no support for financiers who had behaved foolishly - but he would look out for signs of damage to the wider economy. Northern Rock was a panic that threatened to become an all-out crisis, and so officials intervened. Yet such subtle argument is lost on most lay people, who merely see backpedalling. That disconnect between technocrats and the public has been a feature of this turmoil. There were the fine distinctions between \"solvency\" and \"liquidity\"; and references to those lining up outside branches of Northern Rock as \"irrational\". Hector Sants, the chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, declared yesterday: \"The system has worked.\" Such a claim could only have been made from a tower in Canary Wharf; for everyone else from Newcastle to north London's Golders Green, the UK resembled Buenos Aires in the middle of a bank run - with more orderly queues.\nA financial crisis, a government in disarray - and an open goal for the opposition. But it is one the other parties have not yet hit, at least according to today's Guardian/ICM poll. Conducted largely over the past weekend, when the Northern Rock story was gathering momentum, it shows Labour ahead of the Conservatives by eight points - the biggest lead since David Cameron took his party's helm. This poll could be an aberration, or reflect voters' desire for stability during a crisis: Hilaire Belloc's principle of \"always keep a-hold of Nurse / for fear of finding something worse\". Alternatively, it could reflect the reality that on matters of financial regulation there is little between the two main parties.\nThe last Conservative proposal in the area came from John Redwood, whose big idea was to scrap all red tape on mortgages - this amid a crisis caused by lax lending. Like Labour, the main opposition party thinks that the City must be left to its own devices. In 1992 there was a similar cross-party consensus on the ERM - that is, until Black Wednesday. Whether the lesser crisis at Northern Rock will shake up economic thinking in the same way remains to be seen. But a debate on banking regulation - especially transparency - is overdue. The Liberal Democrats are best placed to lead it. Over many years their Treasury spokesman, Vince Cable, has warned about the dangers of financiers using complex financial instruments that few fully understand. The other parties must give some thought to his proposal that, especially when the good times roll, regulators need to enforce traditional discipline.\nMore editorials Topics"

The impact our finances have throughout our lifetime on the way we live is immense, that is why it's never too early to start learning about money. Since the 2008 financial crisis, financial literacy programs have skyrocketed. Schools are developing financial literacy curriculums and after school programs, while many non-profit and for-profit organizations are also taking this initiative. Financial Literacy in Schools\nCarol O'Rourke, Executive Director at The Coalition for Debtor Education, an independent non-profit housed at Fordham Law School, teaches financial literacy at city schools in New York through a game called Financial Jeopardy. \"We use a game show format, with categories like saving, banking, safety, and needs and wants to get the students engaged,\" she says. Exciting Classes\nThey are expecting a boring class, says O'Rourke, not a lively discussion about if a cellphone is really a \"need\" or if a student loan is a good investment. The class is divided into teams, so everyone gets involved and it becomes competitive, with everyone vying to get the most points. The discussions are interesting to the students because they talk about the things that they spend money on now.\nThe \"2012 Financial Literacy and Credit Cards: A Multi Campus Survey,\" published by the International Journal of Business and Social Science found that 70% of undergraduate college students had a credit card and just over a third (33.9%) had only one credit card. This leaves approximately 36% of college students with two or more credit cards. However, according to the survey, only 9.4% of students paid their credit card in full each month, leaving most students (90%) with some indeterminate amount of credit card debt each month, subject to high interest and other charges. Given these troubling statistics, it's very important to teach children, while they're still young, to stay away from debt and show them the best ways to handle the money they receive from babysitting, delivering newspapers or any other part-time jobs that college-aged people tend to have. The Bottom Line\nTeaching children about financial literacy is very important if you want them to grow up to be financially responsible adults. Kids will take a greater interest in financial literacy if the topic is engaging and fun. However, nothing is more important than making open money conversations a regular part of their upbringing."

The exchange raised 15 billion rubles ($498m), with shares priced at 55 rubles each - or the lowest end of its target range. Despite the lower share price, the offering was oversubscribed and marks an important step toward building the country's capital markets, and its overall move toward a more capitalist economy. \"We think Moscow Exchange is critical to the development of the Russian capital markets through growth in trading volume and liquidity,\" says Sean Glodek, Director, Russian Direct Investment Fund, one of the earliest investors in MICEX. The fund was also involved in the IPO.\nThe Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is a $10 billion fund established by the Russian government to make equity investments primarily in the Russian economy. The fund, which is in essence, the first sovereign wealth fund that functions as a private equity fund, invested $80m in the IPO, and brought in $200m in additional foreign investments including China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, which RDIF maintains a co-investment fund with.\nThe exchange is a key focal point in President Vladimir Putin's plan to make Moscow a financial center. The IPO placement itself was done locally in an effort to keep the focus on investing in and on the Russian exchange. Putin has set a goal of $10bn in Russian privatizations by the end of 2013.\nRDIF is backed by the Kremlin, and as Opalesque previously reported, was an early investor in the exchange. \"We started with MICEX-RTS one year ago, we came in as a pre-IPO investor and teamed with Cartesian Capital, BlackRock, CIC and EBRD (European Bank of Reconstruction and Development) in three investment rounds in 2012,\" Glodek says. With the offering RDIF increased its holding from 2.8 to 4.5%.\nCredit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, Sberbank CIB and VTB Capital acted as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners of the offering. Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs International, Morgan Stanley, Renaissance Capital and UBS Investment Bank also acted as joint bookrunners.\nThe exchange company recently announced that it will offer a dividend on its shares, which will benefit investors over the long term as the payout ratio will steadily increase to 50%.\nThe often choppy fortunes of Russian companies have made the MICEX one of the more volatile exchanges. However, Glodek notes that as far as investment in the exchanges space goes overall, MICEX presents a good value, \"longer term we see significant future value in this as a stock. There is significant growth potential in Russia as one of the largest emerging markets globally, and the Exchange will be able to outperform exchanges in more developed economies, which have the growth phase behind them.\"\nHe points to additional reforms like Putin's initiatives to make Moscow a financial hub as well as pension reform, which, once completed will incentivize Russia's institutions to more freely invest in equities on the exchange. On the technology side, the exchange will also be migrating to a faster T+2 settlement structure by the end of 2013.\nOther companies are also introducing support for the exchange. QuantHouse, S&P Capital IQ's Real Time operation has partnered with the European arm of leading Russian financial institution BCS Financial Group to launch low latency market data for MICEX. In addition, BCS is leveraging its trading infrastructure and advanced algo-trading development tools. The companies cite established and long-term demand among European buy-side firms, for access to the Russian market.\nRFID also has plans to be part of other Russian IPOs downstream, \"We are exploring potential opportunities in investing in some other companies planning to go public on the Moscow Exchange. We are working with Franklin Templeton, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs on some of those pre-IPO opportunities,\" Glodek says.\nBeyond IPOs, RFID has plans to continue increasing its activities throughout the year according to Glodek, \"More people are now aware of the Fund and for 2013, that's very exciting for our core business of co-investments with foreign investors in Russia. We are getting a lot of interest from outside investors and this year is on target to be very good for us.\"\nThis article was published in Opalesque's Private Equity Strategies our monthly research update on the global private equity landscape including all sectors and market caps.\nInvesting in a viatical policy\nDaniel Kahan"

The four-day forum brings together 100 global leaders and renowned economists to focus on how to foster global economic growth and prosperity.PHOTO: EPA\nInternational experts yesterday debated ways to measure the world's well-being, in line with G20 calls for statisticians to take into account people's happiness and not just their economic output.The global economic crisis \"has revealed the growing gap between official statistics and people's perceptions of their standards of living,\" said Angel Gurria, \u00adsecretary-general of the OECD.The four-day forum opened in the South Korean port city of Busan to investigate ways of \"going beyond GDP\" and produce a new set of data to better measure the quality of life.Gurria told experts on the environment, development, business and social issues that without such new indicators, a \"crisis of confidence\" could erode trust in institutions and in democracy itself.The OECD's forum follows a call by G20 leaders at last month's summit for statistics \"to better take into account the social and environmental dimensions of economic development.\"It will also push ahead with the recommendations of an expert commission set up by French President Nicolas Sarkozy on the subject.The Sarkozy commission, chaired by Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, wants to move away from indicators based on production to ones based on people's well-being.It says these should assess the levels of freedom, security and contentment as well as economic and ecological resources.The idea of replacing GDP was pioneered by the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. Starting in the 1970s, then-monarch Jigme Singye Wangchuck promoted \"Gross \u00adNational Happiness\" as the goal of development rather than GDP.Gurria, in a keynote speech, said even during the years of strong growth, \"GDP was growing but most people did not necessarily feel better-off. Now, the problem is even more critical.\"\nIn addition to the loss of jobs, pensions and houses so far, he predicted unemployment would continue to rise in most OECD countries throughout next year.\"Last but not least, the emergency rescue package that many countries put in place are often perceived as having mostly benefited the lucky and undeserving few,\" Gurria said. \"Going forward, there is a major risk that people will lose confidence in markets and institutions, and in the capacity of governments to address their problems. This is a major political challenge: We have to restore trust and we can only achieve this if policy action has tangible impacts on people's life.\"Gurria said political momentum is now building for a new generation of statistics to focus on social well-being and progress as well as sustainability issues and various forms of inequality.\"Economic resources are not the only thing that matters in people's life,\" he said."

It's value is largely derived from those three attributes. One additional--and currently most significant--source of its value is the brand equity/publicity Bitcoin enjoys as a rapidly appreciating investment. So, what could go wrong?\n\nIn a classical marketing context, I would look at Porter's five forces of profitability to try and determine the long term value of Bitcoin. Here goes:\n\nThreat of Substitutes, Threat of New Entrants, Competitive Rivalry: The notoriety of Bitcoin is attracting legions of potential substitutes. From software companies to banks, everyone is getting into the act. Bitcoin is, by far, the leader in the space. While it has brilliantly managed its own scarcity, Bitcoin can't manage the scarcity of currency in general. Plus, at the end of the day, software companies, banks and governments can back their currencies with assets. Bitcoin is backed only by goodwill. And, when the fever dies down, users of currency may want some harder guarantees than Bitcoin can provide.\n\nBargaining Power of Customers: For the reasons stated above, users of currency are going to have A LOT of options available to them. And when it comes to use of currency (rather than investing in it), the Bitcoin value proposition is not that strong unless you are trying to avoid detection of your transactions by the government.\n\nBargaining Power of Suppliers: So, who are the suppliers to Bitcoin and other currencies? Well, there's a lot of them. You have the miners of Bitcoin. You also have merchants who are willing to accept Bitcoin or another currency as payment. And both of these groups are likely to stumble into some stiff government regulation pretty soon. Here are just a few of the reasons:\n\nDue to the high degree of privacy it provides, Bitcoin is often used for illegal purchases like drugs, fake IDs, prostitution and more. There is also speculation that it will become the currency of choice for terrorist organizations. Being able to promote security and enforce laws requires that Bitcoin transactions provide a higher degree of transparency to governments than currently exists.\n\nTrading of Bitcoin is generating lots of income. Income which governments want/need to tax.\n\nGovernments derive a large source of their power from the ability to produce and regulate currency. Bitcoin is a threat to that power.\n\nAs part of this, governments (particularly corrupt ones) are in a unique position to manipulate the value of Bitcoin. Take a short position on Bitcoin, then shut down or suspend Bitcoin acceptance in your country, and cash in.\n\nAnd, as Bitcoin becomes a regulated currency it loses a lot of the attributes (namely, privacy) that attract people to it.\n\nShort term, I hope everyone makes a lot of money on Bitcoin. Long-term, you probably need to find another investment."

'Governments may continue to believe in capitalism as a strong financial system, but at the same time they exert increasing control over both banks and the real economy. 'In developed markets, the crisis necessitated a rapid increase in state intervention and, in many people's eyes, has legitimised intervention. Governments have exerted significant control for many years and this is likely to persist,' he said.\n'Only those financial services companies preparing and understanding the long-term underlying trends will be able to play a role of significance in the new world order of banking,' he added.-TradeArabia News Service Tags:\neconomy | investment | PricewaterhouseCoopers | Banking sector | Financial advisory | More Finance & Capital Market Stories"

COURTESY WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Print\nThursday, December 6, 2012 11:03 am By Noah FeldmanBloomberg News Columnist\nBOSTON - From Athens to Rome to Providence, the painful truth about pensions is the same: Unfunded liabilities need to be reformed, and unions don't like it.\nThe difference: Europeans go to the streets when they are unhappy, and Americans go to the courts. In Rhode Island, a pension-reform plan hailed as a national model is being challenged as unconstitutional. Striking down reform would be a disastrous move -- not only for budgets but also for constitutional governance itself.\nIt's easy to sympathize with workers' desire not to have their pensions touched. Many have built decades of expectations on the basis of generous pension plans, and it seems unfair that they should lose out because benefits negotiated on their behalf turn out to be fiscally unsustainable. Moreover, employees, including public employees, think of themselves as protected by contracts that specify those benefits -- and according to the federal and many state constitutions, states are not supposed to make laws impairing the obligation of contracts.\nYet the equation of benefits with inviolable contractual rights is too hasty, both legally and morally. As a legal matter, many public-pension plans are in fact created by statute, and it is well established that what a legislature may do by law, it may also undo. Most of the Rhode Island pension plans are clearly statutory.\nFiscal viability\nEven when benefits are created by contract, the states' obligation to respect those contracts has long been interpreted to allow for them to be altered or even eliminated when public necessity demands it and the modification is deemed reasonable. The looming fiscal crisis in Rhode Island -- and in many other states and cities -- certainly satisfies the condition of necessity. Changes to the age of retirement and the mix of public and private guarantees are reasonable by any measure. In the end, the point of modifying pension plans is to preserve the fiscal viability of the government, which is much better for its creditors than seeing it collapse under the burden of obligations it cannot meet.\nThe moral justification for this legal rule is straightforward: The government creates property rights, and so the government can modify those rights when necessary. The same principle underlies taxes, which Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. memorably called the bill for civilization. The government may take some of the money I've earned because without its protection I wouldn't be able to keep it -- or earn it in the first place.\nIt's certainly unfair that some people get penalized when the government finds it has overreached, and it's especially painful when the victims are working class rather than financiers. But the same principle that allowed the government to pay Chrysler's senior secured creditors 29 cents on the dollar applies equally to unions. In a pinch, the government may curtail some property rights to preserve the health of the whole system. No one ever likes it -- and everyone, regardless of political preferences, makes the same conservative property argument against it.\nSo what protection does anyone have against a government that runs into crises and has to resolve them by spreading the pain around? The answer, bluntly, is democracy. If debt-holding hedge-fund managers didn't like the Barack Obama administration's Chrysler strategy, they could try to take him out of office (and, believe me, they did). If unions ultimately don't accept that pension reform is necessary to save the governments on whom they rely for their jobs, they can go after the politicians who designed it. To this extent, the Europeans have it right: The proper response to policies you don't like is to protest, not to sue.\npension reform, rhode island, bloomberg Next Page\nJohnPella\nI'm sorry professor I don't agree with you. Are you saying all a legislature has to do is pass a law or repeal one to void an element of a contract? Thursday, December 6, 2012\nHi, John. I think the answer is yes - with conditions. All the legislature has to do is pass and/or repeal a law to repeal or void elements in a contract. That said; however, the decision to alter or pass a law must be on sound and valid reasoning. The reason the legislature made the change must pass legal scrutiny. If the reason the legislature changed the contract was not strong enough to cause the change, then that new law would be struck down because it wasn't based on a real need. For example, if the legislature changed the pension because they thought it would attract yellow butterflies to the state, you can bet that the change would be struct down in court and the pension would be restored. In the case of Rhode Island, the state didn't have enough revenue to sustain the original contract. That is considered a valid reason to alter the contract with the expectation that the system will now survive in the long run. Basically, you are allowed to correct fatal decisions, but not whimsical ones."

The Department supports the development of research teams composed of faculty and students to enhance productivity and learning. The faculty's research fall into five broad categories: econometrics, applied microeconomics, applied macroeconomics, public economics, and international economics.\nIn the area of econometrics, faculty research includes work in cointegration; unit-root tests and other time series issues, as well as forecasting. These econometric techniques are applied to the analysis of government expenditures, direct foreign investment, exchange rates and structural breaks. The faculty are also involved in the application of full information maximum likelihood estimation, limited dependent variable approaches and discrete factor analysis to international development, economic education, health care and consumer decisions.\nIn the field of applied microeconomics, faculty research is particularly diverse. Recent work has involved health economics topics such as the effects of prenatal care on birth weights, demand for abortions and demand for contraception. In the field of labor economics, research is ongoing on the employment effects of the Job Training Partnership Act and into work life estimates. A great deal of research is being conducted in environmental economics, including the determinants of biodiversity and water policy. In addition, the department has a number of faculty members interested in the emerging field of sports economics, with current research under way into demand for professional soccer, the possible existence of discrimination in Major League Baseball Hall of Fame voting, and into the determinants and effects of changes in the distribution of income among professional athletes.\nFaculty research in the area of applied macroeconomics includes inquiries into exchange rate stability, patterns of foreign investment and optimal government size. In addition, applications of growth theory and endogenous growth models are being examined and refined. The impact of inflation on government policy multipliers in the US is another area of macroeconomic research.\nThe department is actively involved in the emerging field of public economics. Recent research includes empirical congressional voting models, the determinants of legislator ideology and game theoretic rent-seeking models. The analysis of state and local spending patterns in the U.S., Canada, and developing nations are research projects in public finance.

The report, written by the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, suggests that downward pressure on global trade and slack demand from the U.S. will have grim results in Asia. Fiscal cliff quiz: How much will taxes go up?\nA failure to resolve the crisis could \"significantly impact growth in the region,\" the report warns. And growing policy uncertainty could result in a flood of capital to Asia -- a destabilizing trend. If the U.S. falls off the cliff, some Asian countries could see growth decline by up to 2.2 percentage points, with particularly negative ramifications for export-based economies like Singapore and Hong Kong. GDP growth in China, now the world's second largest economy, could slow by nearly one percentage point in the worst-case scenario. Most of that impact would result from a decline in trade, though the analysis also accounts for the impact of possible changes in inflation and interest rates. Take a look over the fiscal cliff The automatic spending cuts and tax increases associated with the fiscal cliff are set to take effect in January. Congress could punt and sign a stop-gap measure, come to a grand bargain or perhaps fail to take any action. Related: Perils of going over the cliff temporarily A total failure could send the U.S. back into recession and would likely result in substantial job losses. In Asia, the economic ramifications will vary widely depending on the ultimate action by Congress. For example, growth in export-dependent Singapore is projected to fall by 0.2 percentage points if the U.S. only enacts the scheduled automatic spending cuts. But if the U.S. also goes forward with most of the possible tax hikes and allows unemployment benefits to expire, Singapore's GDP could fall by 2.2 percentage points. Dimon: Solve fiscal cliff, U.S. economy will soar The U.N. model also accounts for a projected decline in both indirect and direct trade. For example, if the U.S. stops importing a product that is assembled in China from components made in Singapore, that would translate into slower growth for both countries. Shuvojit Banerjee, one of the report's authors, said that economies like Singapore, Hong Kong and China need to look closer to home for growth in order to blunt the full impact of the cliff. \"You have to try and improve regional trade,\" he said, pointing to regional markets like India and China that could help absorb the impact of reduced demand in the U.S. CNNMoney (Hong Kong) First published December 14, 2012: 3:36 AM ET Comments Social Surge - What's Trending"

He has huddled with dozens of CEOs in his current career as an executive coach. During the dot-com crash 12 years ago, he kept his wits and did not sell.\nBut he's selling now.\n\"You have to trust your government. You have to trust other governments. You have to trust Wall Street,\" says Neitlich, 47. \"And I don't trust any of these.\"\nDefying decades of investment history, ordinary Americans are selling stocks for a fifth year in a row. The selling has not let up despite unprecedented measures by the Federal Reserve to persuade people to buy and the come-hither allure of a levitating market. Stock prices have doubled from March 2009, their low point during the Great Recession.\nIt's the first time ordinary folks have sold during a sustained bull market since relevant records were first kept during World War II, an examination by The Associated Press has found. The AP analyzed money flowing into and out of stock funds of all kinds, including relatively new exchange-traded funds, which investors like because of their low fees.\n\"People don't trust the market anymore,\" says financial historian Charles Geisst of Manhattan College. He says a \"crisis of confidence\" similar to one after the Crash of 1929 will keep people away from stocks for a generation or more.\nThe implications for the economy and living standards are unclear but potentially big. If the pullback continues, some experts say, it could lead to lower spending by companies, slower U.S. economic growth and perhaps lower gains for those who remain in the market.\nSince they started selling in April 2007, eight months before the start of the Great Recession, individual investors have pulled at least $380 billion from U.S. stock funds, a category that includes both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to estimates by the AP. That is the equivalent of all the money they put into the market in the previous five years.\nInstead of stocks, they're putting money into bonds because those are widely perceived as safer investments. Individuals have put more than $1 trillion into bond mutual funds alone since April 2007, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group representing investment funds.\nSelling stocks during either a downturn or a recovery is unusual. Americans almost always buy more than they sell during both periods.\nSince World War II, nine recessions besides the Great Recession have been followed by recoveries lasting at least three years. According to data from the Investment Company Institute, individual investors sold during and after only one of those previous downturns - the one from November 1973 through March 1975.

        "webpage": "Why Learning About The Basics Of Being Tax Accountant Is Needed\n\nBy Richard Price\n\nBoth bookkeeping and accounting tasks are crucial techniques for companies, yet it aims to center on different elements. Next, it refers to practices that record fiscal transactions, yet on the other hand, accounting summarizes, translates, determines, and documents specifics. Its main difference is noticeable on auditing methods that study and interpret those matters that documentation and report failed to do.\n\nAiming your focus on those negotiations is named as its main foundations, but accountants are requested to handle its intricate aspects. Skilled professionals who function as tax accountant arranged plans by orderly manners. Because of systems applicable for simplifying those practices, practitioners employed by smaller corporations determine and summarize those subjects.\n\nIn relation with that, they are advised to examine transactions and declarations to observe calculative conditions, requests, and demands. Amidst those days, they are expected to examine and translate information applied for discussing managerial revenues and performances to directors that cause informed decisions. Both aspects seem comparable to incapable specialists since they focus on those subjects.\n\nIf you wanted to apply for both fields, you are warned to cultivate your knowledge about its basic notions. Skillful practitioners who control smaller enterprises are designated to conduct auditing techniques, rather than tracking their organizational negotiations. As the result, identifying and preparing reports thru utilizing those factors is necessary. Despite your poor knowledge about those jobs, they could still perform those factors with the presence of programs which document, summarize, determine, and translate reports, hence abridging transactions.\n\nApart from that, they track undertakings of enterprises and control other jobs linked with calculative practices designated to other specialists. Your own involvement in exercises and comprehension about its basic notions permits you to apply for those fields. If you wanted to apply as accountants and bookkeepers, you are obligated to organize your registrations which depict your credibility.\n\nAs professionals, you are designated to control those methods, still bookkeepers are ordered to conduct the direction of negotiations. If centralized on assuring its apt ends then they serve as accountants and inspect reports. During other times, they could track and identify transactions that made bases for knowing fiscal data.\n\nBoth those areas enable you to manage noncore, managerial, and core tasks which enable you to sustain reports. Outsourcing those services is important since skillful specialists appointed to manage those tasks perform those practices by shortened means. As roughly all producers sustained better standards for compliance, governance parameters, and harms, it was used for negotiations.\n\nAlso, it allows you to attain adequate skills without searching and employing those practitioners. Because of this, it reduces, neglects, and eliminates potential mistakes that may emerge. In addition to that, your money, assets, and time are invested on other managerial subjects. It offers cheaper substitutes for those duties.\n\nIn relation with that, its basic ideas directed to systematic budgets and plans, basic bookkeeping, account payables and receivables, and internal auditing. If you should reduce properties and rates for managerial techniques, outsourcing is named as its cheaper substitutes.

Harris, CPA/CFF, Chairman, AICPA Board of Directors Published October 12, 2010\nAs I write this column, I'm coming to the end of an exciting and fulfilling year as Institute Board Chairman. When I began my term, the country was just beginning to emerge from a year of financial turmoil and uncertainty. I am pleased to see that we have come through the worst of these times and that our profession rose to the challenge of helping businesses and individuals navigate the economic hardships. Now, we stand ready to grapple with the significant changes and events affecting our daily work. I set out to focus my attention on several critical areas during my chairmanship. I'd like to tell you a little about what has happened in each one, and about further developments we can expect. The globalization of business. Although the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards for U.S. public companies appeared to have moved to the back burner during the worst of the financial crisis, the Securities and Exchange Commission in February said it still plans to decide in 2011 whether to require its use by issuers. The Institute continues to strongly support having one set of high-quality, globally accepted accounting standards for public entities and supports the thoughtful and concrete steps the SEC is taking as outlined in its Work Plan to prepare for a possible transition to IFRS. If you haven't been keeping up with IFRS, you should start now. The AICPA's IFRS website, , provides updates and resources that become more and more important as we get closer to an SEC decision. Sustainability. I want the CPA profession to be a leader in this area and we have made significant inroads this past year. The Institute has created a wealth of resources to inform members on this issue and help them educate clients and employers about it, and has participated in sustainability initiatives on an international level. Since it's also important to be a good corporate role model, I'm happy to say that the AICPA was recognized by the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce for working toward Green Plus certification by implementing environmentally conscious standards into our business practices. Moreover, the AICPA was one of more than 20 organizations to form a committee that would oversee development of an integrated reporting model. The International Integrated Reporting Committee includes the heads of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the International Accounting Standards Board, the International Federation of Accountants, each of the four largest accounting firms and representatives from some of the world's largest institutional investors and governance organizations.\nFinancial regulatory reform. I'm very pleased with the Institute's successes on behalf of our members and the public interest as this legislation made its way through Congress. We were, for example, able to obtain recognition for CPAs' customary advice and counsel under the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing effectively that CFPB regulation would duplicate existing and appropriate state regulation of the CPA profession. When President Obama signed monumental reform legislation into law in July, we quickly responded with resources for members, including webcasts, Journal of Accountancy coverage and articles in other member publications, inclusion in this fall's audit risk alert, sessions at several upcoming conferences and specialized communications for specific member segments. Greater involvement of young CPAs. We continue to select promising young people for the AICPA Leadership Academy, a training program launched in July 2009 that prepares CPAs for future leadership roles within the profession and within their work environments. We also will continue the practice of putting at least one CPA under age 36 on virtually every AICPA committee, something started with last year's Leadership Academy class, to glean the insights of young CPAs as we deal with issues and challenges affecting our profession. In addition, to help maintain a pipeline of future CPAs, we recently launched a new website, This Way to CPA. It is designed to extend the great work of our tremendously successful Start Here. Go Places. student recruitment campaign, helping those who are interested in the profession to understand how they can become a part of it. Young CPAs can find information about professional issues, career development and networking opportunities from our robust Young CPA Network.\nFinally, I could not wrap up this year without mentioning another very significant development, the launch of the blue ribbon panel that is evaluating the future of standard setting for private companies. The complexities of the current economic environment have made it clear that these organizations' financial statement users have unique needs that are often very different from those of public companies. On Oct. 8, a majority of members of the panel decided to recommend GAAP with exceptions for private companies and a separate, standard-setting board. The AICPA is one of the sponsors of the 18-member panel on which Institute President and CEO Barry Melancon, CPA, sits. We will update you on future developments, particularly when the panel issues its report to the Financial Accounting Foundation. It has been extremely satisfying to be able to give back to the profession I love. As I end my year, I believe we are poised to take on new challenges and to thrive in a rapidly changing environment. I thank you all for allowing me an opportunity to play such an exciting role. A"

        "webpage": "Budget Review From ISB\nMar 1, 2011 2:07 pm IST\nBy Akshay Rajagopalan and Sanjeev Sharma\nAkshay Rajagopalan\nFinance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's sixth budget is not a spectacularly reformist one and does nothing to topple the economic applecart. It is both balanced and growth oriented, although it falls short in some key areas.\nManaging fiscal deficit\nThe fiscal deficit target for FY2011-12 has been ambitiously pegged at 4.6%, down from 5.1% this year through March, but we question the feasibility of this target since various subsidies are believed to be under-reported. Improving the fiscal deficit is critical from the point of view of stimulating private investment and controlling inflation. It would also aid debt markets, thereby creating engines to fuel growth. The reduction in the deficit from 5.5% to 5.1% this fiscal year was aided by windfall gains from 3G spectrum allocations, and it will be interesting to see what instrument the government uses to achieve the target this year.\nTaming inflation\nInflation is one of the major issues plaguing India's economy, but surprisingly the budget didn't have a clear focus on curbing prices. The exemption limit on personal taxes has been raised marginally to give some relief to aam aadmi (the common man), but there are no major budgetary measures to keep inflation in check in the short term.\nSanjeev Sharma\nRepatriating black money\nIt is also heartening to note that the fight against corruption and black money got a mention in the finance minister's budget speech. A five-fold strategy has been announced. The most prominent initiatives are the formation of a Financial Action Task Force for anti-money laundering and a comprehensive national policy for taking legal action on black money from drug-trafficking. The intent is clear, but the efficacy of the proposals will depend on how well they are executed.\nPersonal taxes On the personal income tax front, the finance minister announced a modest rise in the exemption limit from 160,000 rupees ($3,534) to 180,000 rupees ($3,976). In an environment of persistent inflation, this might be viewed as grossly insufficient. There is, however, a bonanza for senior citizens.\nIndustry Impact\nThe budget is largely positive for industry. On the indirect tax front, the finance minister has given industry a boost by maintaining peak excise duty at 10%. He has also reduced customs duty on inputs used for selective industries, which will help moderate the effect of rising input prices. We believe this will trickle down to consumers in the form of lower prices. Mr. Mukherjee plans to compensate for these sops by widening the service tax net and marginally increasing the minimum alternate tax, among other measures. However, the net effect to the exchequer of all the tax proposals is a loss of two billion rupees, which will make the attainment of the fiscal deficit target even more challenging.\nAccelerating Infrastructure Development\nThe infrastructure sector has received a shot in the arm with an increase in planned outlay and the raising of the limit on foreign institutional investment in corporate bonds to $25 billion, among other measures. However, the real challenges to the infrastructure sector are on the execution side, so we are viewing the increase in funding with cautious optimism.\nReinvigorating Agriculture It is common knowledge that inefficiencies in India's food supply chain have led to tremendous losses in perishable food items. This budget brings an increased focus and higher spending on warehouses and mega-food parks, which will help cut losses and improve supply, helping cool food inflation. The budget also brings in measures to increase credit flow to the agriculture sector. The Finance Minister wants to improve rice-based cropping systems in India's eastern states and he has also promised to remove bottlenecks in the production of wholesale price index-critical items, such as fruits and vegetables.\nThe allocation for the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana has been increased by 16% to 78.6 billion rupees, which should help funding agricultural schemes. But the real improvement has to come from better farm productivity that leads to increased production per acre of cultivable area.\nEducation Education spending remains a mixed bag. The outlay on education has been raised by 24% to 521 billion rupess and more stress is being laid on vocational education, but no impetus has been provided specifically for higher education. Education loans should have been brought under priority sector lending to help young talent access better education.\nOverall, the budget maintains the status quo, but it should still fuel India's socio-economic growth trajectory.\nWe, at ISB, give it a 7/10 rating.\nPuneet Jain, Sudeep Laad, Niloy Sadhu and Sidharth Malhotra contributed to this article.

The need for simplification is particularly pressing for small businesses, which make up the majority of business taxpayers.\" \"The 'facts and circumstances' approach on which the temporary regulations rely has led to long-standing controversy and uncertainty\" in this area, Conjura said. \"The AICPA recommends that the government develop and include in the next set of regulations significantly more bright line tests, objective standards and safe harbors.\" Conjura also said the AICPA believes the de minimis rule in the regulations, which requires an annual financial statement that meets the definition of an Applicable Financial Statement, discriminates against smaller taxpayers. The definition of \"Applicable Financial Statement\" requires preparation of the statement in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and use of the statement in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or with any federal government agency other than the IRS. Instead, the AICPA recommends the use of an alternative test that would allow smaller taxpayers to meet the eligibility requirement for the de minimis rule. For example, an aggregate dollar ceiling could be set on the taxpayer's tax deduction; the ceiling could be measured by a defined attribute reported on the tax return, such as a percentage of tax gross receipts.\nThe AICPA's testimony was based on its April 17 comment letter to the IRS about the guidance.

        "webpage": "Experts: Recession worst 'fiscal cliff' outcome\nBy JOHN O'CONNOR - The Associated PressSPRINGFIELD - Government experts who run the numbers estimate Illinois could lose $1 billion in federal revenue if President Barack Obama and Congress cannot reach a budget agreement and allow the economy to plunge off the so-called \"fiscal cliff.\"\nBut more unpredictable - and perhaps more worrisome - is what impact another recession, spurred by the possible federal free fall, would have on Illinois. The state could lose an additional $1 billion because of sagging tax revenue beginning next month and running through at least mid-2014.States are anxiously monitoring the faceoff between Democrat Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, who are trying to reach a budget deal to avoid automatic tax increases and nearly across-the-board spending cuts that would take effect Jan. 1, a deadline set last year when the two sides reached a federal debt-ceiling pact.\"We watch that every day from Washington,\" Gov. Pat Quinn said last week.Many states are worried about how to plan budgets for the coming year, based on the uncertainty. But Quinn's office won't discuss the potential fallout.The state had enough problems to begin with. Officials predict several state agencies' programs and services won't make it through the budget year without additional money. There's also the seemingly never-ending $9 billion backlog of bills owed to vendors and a worst-in-the-nation pension program deficit, a fix for which Quinn calls his top priority.Nonetheless, the Democratic governor has \"full confidence\" in Obama to broker a deal.The national consequences are clear: Federal income taxes would increase by ending cuts implemented during President George W. Bush's administration. There would be broad-based cuts to most federal agencies, including defense spending. But money for the federal payroll and major programs such as Social Security and Medicaid would be spared.Should the cuts go into effect, Illinois would lose $305 million in federal grants for education, public housing and nutrition programs for low-income women and children next year, according to Michael Bird, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist for the National Conference of State Legislatures.Bird said the state would lose $740 million in defense money, although specifics aren't known. A spokeswoman said officials at Scott Air Force Base in southwestern Illinois had not received any instructions about potential reductions.More hazardous could be the economic recession that's almost certain to follow a fiscal cliff dive; experts believe increased taxes and federal spending cuts could choke off business activity.\nState Revenue Department officials had already predicted that receipts from the state's three largest sources - individual income taxes, corporate income and sales taxes - would drop slightly this year, and post only a 2.4 percent gain in the budget year that begins July 1, 2013. If the federal budget crisis is unsolved, those receipts would decline by just over $1 billion between Jan. 1 and mid-2014, officials say.That amounts to about 4 percent of the estimated $27 billion those three sources would produce for the general revenue fund.The reduction in receipts would be offset by a $45 million increase in fiscal 2014 with the expiration of Bush-era tax relief - there would be fewer federal tax deductions, meaning a higher income on which state taxes are based. For example, the state could possibly see $20 million more because businesses would be allowed less federal depreciation on equipment purchases.A Pew Center on the States report in November found Illinois more vulnerable to the fiscal cliff's impact than others because about 8.5 percent of its revenue comes from federal sources, above the national average of 6.6 percent.But Ingrid Schroeder, a Pew Center director, noted that recession could be far worse than cuts to federal programs.\"States have already had to make really tough budget decisions over the last couple of years,\" Schroeder said. \"This uncertainty about exactly what their revenue is going to be makes an already difficult process that much more difficult.\""

        "webpage": "What Went Wrong With the Bush Tax Cuts What Went Wrong With the Bush Tax Cuts December 6, 2012 Print\nCritics of the Bush tax cuts often dismiss the tax changes as a failed experiment in free-market economics. Noting that economic growth was slower in the years following the cuts than in the years preceding them, some critics see the experience as evidence that tax cuts simply do not work.\nBut the claim that these tax cuts exemplified free-market economic thinking is baseless. The Bush tax cuts had a number of problems from a market-oriented perspective: they were phased in slowly, set to expire within a decade, entailed a Keynesian emphasis on stimulating aggregate demand, and - above all - were undertaken without any effort to reduce spending.\nIn light of these problems, there is no reason to overturn decades of theoretical and empirical research supporting the link between low taxation and growth. The episode offers a cautionary lesson in how not to cut taxes.\nStaggered Reforms\nThe \"Bush tax cuts\" are the product of two staggered tax reforms: the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The 2001 tax cut immediately reduced marginal income tax rates, but by a small amount. Each of the top four rates was reduced by 0.5 percentage points in the first year. In 2002, a new bottom marginal rate reduced the tax applied to the first several thousand dollars of income from 15 percent to 10 percent.\nAs originally designated in the 2001 law, all tax changes were scheduled to take effect by 2006. The top marginal income tax rate was to have fallen from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, while the bottom rate was to have fallen from 15 percent to 10 percent.\nThe 2003 tax cut accelerated this process and immediately implemented income tax rate reductions that had not been scheduled to take effect for one to three more years. In addition, the 2003 law immediately cut the top marginal capital gains tax rate for assets held more than a year from 20 percent to 15 percent and the bottom long-term capital gains rates from 8 and 10 percent to 5 percent (and eventually to 0 by 2008).\nIn addition to reducing marginal tax rates, each tax cut also included a number of additional provisions. The 2001 tax cut, for example, included a one-time retroactive \"tax rebate.\" The Treasury sent checks (up to $300 for singles and $600 for married couples) to taxpayers who had filed their taxes in 2000. It also increased the standard deduction for joint filers, expanded the per-child tax credit, increased the tax credit for qualifying child-care expenses, introduced a new deduction for qualified property owners, and created or expanded various education credits and deductions. The 2003 cut accelerated the implementation of these provisions as well.\nDespite the shortcomings of these tax cuts, there is strong theoretical and empirical support for low taxation. Keynesian models, for example, emphasize the short-run benefits of tax cuts, stressing that they put money in the pockets of consumers and in the accounts of businesses. According to the Keynesian view, this increases purchasing power and boosts aggregate demand. The \"real business cycle\" school of thought, on the other hand, focuses on the longer run and emphasizes that low marginal tax rates tend to increase peoples' incentives to work and save, increasing aggregate output.\nFinally, growth models teach us that lower and more uniform rates can improve long-run economic growth because high tax rates can be an impediment to investment in research and development, and because tax policies that favor one sector over another can drive labor and capital (including human capital) into less-taxed but lower-productivity sectors.\nProblematic Unpredictability\nGood tax systems are stable and predictable. From the beginning, however, the Bush tax cuts made policy less predictable because the tax changes were set to expire at the end of 2010. This automatic expiration date was an unfortunate consequence of the fact that these tax changes were passed under a legislative procedure known as reconciliation. Since it was unclear that his allies in the Senate could procure the 60 votes necessary to enact the 2001 tax cut, President Bush decided to use reconciliation because it permits budget legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority of senators.\nHowever, there was a catch. The Byrd Rule, adopted in 1985, prohibits the use of reconciliation to pass legislation that increases the deficit beyond a 10-year term. Because the 2001 and 2003 tax acts made no serious effort to cut spending, the cuts were projected to add hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit. Thus they had to expire at the end of 2010. The Tax Act of 2010 gave the rates another two years of life, but their looming expiration at the end of 2012"

        "webpage": "More Jobs, But Wait: They May Not Pay Much By editor\nOriginally published on May 4, 2013 11:53 am Transcript SCOTT SIMON, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. The economy added 165,000 jobs in April. That exceeded the expectations of economists. It also drove down the unemployment rate to a four-year low, 7.5 percent. Unfortunately, the biggest gains were in lower-paying fields like hospitality and temp agencies. And as the school year comes to a close and young people start looking, the question is will there be enough work for them. NPR's Sonari Glinton reports. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Wall Street got pretty excited about the jobs numbers. The Department of Labor went back and revised the last two months' numbers, stocks were up and all was right with the world. OK - maybe not. LOUIS HYMAN: But when you start to dig deeper and start to tease apart the numbers, you get a very different picture of what's going on in the economy. GLINTON: Louis Hyman teaches at Cornell University, and he says while those who got full-time work went up by 165,000, there's another number he's looking at. HYMAN: Well, the people who are working part-time jobs is increasing by almost 300,000. So, you know, what we're starting to see in these numbers is not a recovery of full-time, good, stable work, the way we think work should be, but an economy of temps, waiters and people stringing together part-time gigs. GLINTON: All right. Here's the thing: there are nearly eight million people who are working part-time but want to be working full-time. Hyman says those jobs are often jobs that would have normally been taken by teenagers. HYMAN: Are now taken by people who are in their 30s and their 40s, people who are being laid off and looking for work and so their crowding out those younger workers, with a, I think, a long-term effect on the formation of jobs skills for younger people. GLINTON: If you want to see this effect on young people you need only seek out your nearest group of teenagers. (SOUNDBITE OF SKATEBOARDING) GLINTON: Those closest groups to me was at Hamilton High in Los Angeles. Darian Hall is a senior and she's finally gotten a job after looking for years. She works at Best Buy. She says not working through most of high school has taught her to save her money. DARIAN HALL: Prom's coming up soon, so, you know, I have to buy a prom dress. And, like, I don't want to be, like, on my mom, like, oh my god, can you help me buy this? Like, I want to do stuff on my own kind of, be a little bit independent. GLINTON: Hall says she volunteered before finally finding a job. She says the thing that was stressing her out was getting work experience - any work experience. HALL: It's not going to be as hard anymore since I have work experience, 'cause that's what they really look for mostly. And if you don't have work experience, then it's kind of like what are you doing-ish kind of, yeah. GLINTON: Hall's friend Kyanna Holness says she can't find a part-time job but she'll take what she can get. KYANNA HOLNESS: It doesn't really matter. Like, she said, it's like mostly, I'm looking for work experience, like, I'm not afraid to work for free 'cause, you know, in this economy it's kind of hard to find a good-paying job, especially if you're 17. BILL RODGERS: In an economy where we're just barely keeping pace in terms of population growth that prosperity is going to be very slow to come to young people. GLINTON: Bill Rodgers is an economist at Rutgers University. He says not only are young people competing with adults for part-time work... RODGERS: ...since you have these adults working in jobs that are below their capacity, true capacity, there's less income, less earnings, less tax revenue going into the economy and which then translates into fewer jobs - spillover jobs - that would go to teens. GLINTON: Rodgers says that one of the biggest factors that could affect young people is if the economy takes a hit because of government cuts, referred to as sequestration. He says the effects of the cuts on the economy are likely to show up in June and July when young people are entering the workforce. RODGERS: I'm very nervous about this summer for young people, especially for young minority teens who have unemployment rates that are well in excess of 20 percent. And then if you go in some urban areas, they even have unemployment rates, you know, in the 30, 40 percent. GLINTON: Which Rodgers says will not only affect those young people's jobs prospects in the future but our overall economy for years to come. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.

        "webpage": "Chinese Corruption Is Typical for a Developing Country\nSlateMoneyboxA blog about business and economics.Dec. 10 2012 1:23 PM\nYou hear a lot about Chinese corruption but rarely anything that puts it into a proper context. Fans of Lincoln will note that the rapidly industrializing United States of the 19th century was also pretty corrupt. And in a new paper, George Mason's Carlos Ramirez argues that the comparison is a good one in terms of per capita income and that it paints a relatively bright picture of Chinese governance:\nThis paper compares corruption in China over the past 15 years with corruption in the U.S. between 1870 and 1930, periods that are roughly comparable in terms of real income per capita. Corruption indicators for both countries and both periods are constructed by tracking corruption news in prominent U.S. newspapers. Several robustness checks confirm the reliability of the constructed corruption indices for both countries. The comparison indicates that corruption in the U.S. in the early 1870s  -  when it's real income per capita was about $2,800 (in 2005 dollars)  -  was 7 to 9 times higher than China's corruption level in 1996, the corresponding year in terms of income per capita. By the time the U.S. reached $7,500 in 1928  -  approximately equivalent to China's real income per capita in 2009  -  corruption was similar in both countries. The findings imply that, while corruption in China is an issue that merits attention, it is not at alarmingly high levels, compared to the U.S. historical experience. The paper further argues that the corruption and development experiences of both the U.S. and China appear to be consistent with the \"life-cycle\" theory of corruption  -  rising at the early stages of development, and declining after modernization has taken place. Hence, as China continues its development process, corruption will likely decline.\nAdvertisement I'd file that conclusion under \"speculative.\" Perhaps Chinese governance won't improve, economic growth will come to a halt, and there'll be a new round of profound political dislocations. But this is certainly suggestive information, and the implication is that corruption isn't necessarily a barrier to further Chinese economic and political development."

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers, click the \"Reprints\" link at the top of any article. From the March Special Report issue of Treasury & Risk magazine\nSEPA Facilitates Making Payments for Subs\nCompanies in Western Europe will now have an easier time using payments-on-behalf-of structures.\nAs more companies take steps to centralize their payment processes,those using payments-on-behalf-of (POBO) structures will get a helping hand from the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).\nCompanies employing a POBO structure make payments for subsidiaries out of a central account, which allows them to cut back on bank accounts and related costs.\n\"In-house banks have been around for decades, while POBO solutions have been around for only about the last 10 years or so,\" said Drew Arnold, trade finance/cash management corporates global solutions Americas, Global Transaction Banking, at Deutsche Bank. \"SEPA is one of the main reasons why POBO has taken off.\"\nPrior to SEPA, companies needed a bank account in every European country in which they made payments because each country had a different clearing system, Arnold said. That limited the benefits of using POBO. Now that SEPA has established a single clearing system for 33 European countries, a single bank account anywhere in the Eurozone is sufficient.\nMoreover, SEPA formats include an on-behalf-of field, unlike legacy payment formats. So the supplier that's being paid not only sees that the payment came from the parent company's bank account, it can see which of a company's business units or subsidiaries the payment is on behalf of, Arnold said. \"The receiver can easily reconcile that payment because it is clear who is paying.\"\nAs a result, \"companies have started using POBO,\" he said. \"It is not yet common practice, but we expect it to become much more prevalent for corporations to use POBO in Western Europe within the next two to three years.\"\nEfficiencies and Challenges\nWhen all the payments for business units go through a centralized corporate bank account, the company can eliminate the other accounts its business units formerly used to make payments. Companies save the fees they paid for those bank accounts, plus related expenses such as audit costs, said Arnold, pictured at left. \"Reducing the number of bank accounts can result in quite a significant cost reduction for companies.\"\nCentralizing payments can also allow a company to reduce IT expenses and labor costs, such as the staff time involved in reconciling payments. The internal savings that are possible could be even more of an incentive for companies, he said.\nEliminating the business units' accounts also does away with pockets of cash sitting in those accounts. \"You can have it all in one master account, which means more cash is now accessible for use by the company,\" Arnold said.\nOne challenge for companies using POBO can be the process of divvying up the files the bank sends back about the payments to provide each business unit with the information it needs. Arnold said Deutsche Bank is working to provide companies with consolidated data about funds flow as well as business-level payment information.\nPOBO works best for \"large multinationals with complex structures,\" he said. \"If you have a monoline business - just one legal entity - there's little benefit to doing all this work to create an in-house bank.\n\"The more complex and geographically spread out a company is, the greater benefit they're going to get out of establishing an in-house bank and using POBO on top of that,\" Arnold said. \"On the other hand, the more complex and widespread they are, the more difficult it is to implement an in-house bank and POBO.\"\nThe advent of SEPA means that \"less-complex companies can benefit from moving to an in-house bank, which was not the case in the past,\" he added."

        "webpage": "Why It's Time for Buyers to Reconsider an ARM\nWritten by: Jeff Brown\nNEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- Adjustable-rate mortgages have been in the doghouse for years, shunned by borrowers who heard horror stories about homeowners whose ARM rates soared in the '00s, driving monthly mortgage payments through the roof. On Wednesday the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that only 4% of mortgage applicants were seeking ARMs.\nBut maybe it's time to reconsider. For some borrowers, an ARM can be cheaper than a fixed-rate mortgage. Also, ARM rates are enticingly low right now but could rise as the economy improves. Annual and lifetime caps based on today's low starting rates would prevent a borrower's future ARM rates from going too high.\nAs the name implies, an adjustable-rate mortgage has a floating interest rate. Typically, it starts out low -- lower than you'd pay on a fixed-rate loan that charges the same rate for its lifetime. After an initial period of one to 10 years, the ARM rate adjusts every 12 months. The new rate is figured by adding a \"margin,\" such as 2.75 percentage points, to an index such as the rate paid by a specific bond.\nThe borrower saves money by paying a lower rate in the initial period than on a fixed-rate loan. But there is a risk the ARM rate will someday go higher than the borrower would have paid with a fixed-rate deal. In the past few years, rates on 15- and 30-year fixed-rate loans have been so low that most borrowers figured it was better to lock in a fixed rate than take chances on an adjustable one.\nSo why look at ARMs now? Mainly because ARM rates are likely to rise, so that today's ARM is probably a better deal than the one you might get in a year or two. ARMs come with caps that typically prevent future adjustments from rising more than 2 percentage points a year, or 5 or 6 points over the loan's life. If you start at an exceptionally low rate today, like the 2.7% average for five-year ARMs, you'll never pay more than 8.7%, which is not especially high by historical standards.\nOf course, a rise that high would cause a dramatic increase in your monthly payment, so it would make no sense to get this ARM if you really thought rates would go that high and stay there. You'd be much better off getting today's 30-year, fixed-rate loan, averaging 3.5%.\nThis means the best candidate for an ARM is the borrower who expects to pay off the loan during the initial period, such as five, seven or 10 years, while the rate is fixed.\nThis would include one who is buying a home that is likely to be sold during that period.\nIt would also include a homebuyer, or a homeowner who is refinancing an older mortgage with a high rate, who is capable of making extra payments to retire the loan ahead of schedule."

But Gordon's answers to those problems couldn't be more different from theirs.\nGordon proposes fixes for the U.S. economy that mix liberal and conservative solutions. He supports a higher minimum wage, for example, and the deregulation of labor markets. He's dismissive of Trump's call to restrict immigration.\nAds By Artscroll:\nYet he doesn't believe that more government spending is needed to fuel innovation, a cornerstone of Hillary Clinton's platform.\nGordon's book, \"The Rise and Fall of American Growth,\" argues that a slowdown in innovation since 1970 has hampered growth in productivity. That means that U.S. workers aren't becoming more efficient as fast as they did in the past. And that, in turn, means that pay is likely to remain sluggish.\nGordon discussed his proposed solutions in an interview, which has been edited for length and clarity:\nQ. We're seeing voter anger and a rise of outsider candidates in the current presidential election. Do you see the slowdowns in growth and innovation as a reason for these developments?\nA. Yes, indeed. I think there's extremely justifiable frustration at the wage stagnation, which is a byproduct of both slow productivity growth and the rising inequality  -  the fact that much of the income growth is being enjoyed by people at the top.\nThere are 10 policy recommendations at the end of my book. Some of them have bipartisan support, (such as) increasing the earned income tax credit, which appeals to Democrats because it helps poor people. And it appeals to Republicans because it provides an incentive for poor people to go to work.\nThere are other recommendations that come right out of the Republican play book. For instance, ending what are called tax expenditures  -  the deductions and exemptions that all so often go to the upper-income groups. No more articulate spokesman for getting rid of these loopholes is Harvard's Martin Feldstein, who was the head of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers.\nAnother recommendation that appeals to conservatives is to get rid of onerous regulations, the ridiculous red tape that requires unnecessary training to enter various occupations.\nOr the barriers to real estate development that are so evident in places like San Francisco and New York that drive up the price of housing.\nBut there is plenty on my plate for the Democrats as well, starting with the direct confrontation of inequality. The most important single federal government initiative is moving to copy other countries that have universal pre-school, often not just for 4-year olds but for 3-year olds. So there is a lot for both sides of the political aisle to grapple with for the existential problems we face.\nQ. What about more spending on basic research and infrastructure?\nA. We have a uniquely effective venture capital industry that stands ready to throw money at almost any promising new idea. That's why I don't see the government needing to shovel money into the innovation process or into technological change. Indeed, some of the early development of the Internet was sponsored by the Defense Department. But now, I think our invention process is self-sustaining on its own.\nQ. Do you think most people intuitively understand the phenomenon that you see, or do you think this will require massive adjustment?\nA. What I find unfortunate is the tendency of voters to blame the government for both the rise in inequality and the slow productivity growth, when my diagnosis is that it emanates from decisions in the private sector.\nYou can't blame the government if the opportunities for invention just aren't there the way they used to be 10 or 20 or 50 years ago.\nAnd the same goes with inequality. We're not going to prohibit people from inventing Facebook and becoming a super multibillionaire or inventing Microsoft. That would be totally non-productive.\nBut we can use policies that essentially force the winners of the technological race to share some of the benefits that they have received from society in the form of these super high incomes and stock market valuations. Share them with the rest of the economy though a top bracket, higher tax rate for millionaires and people making more than $10 million.\nMy policy recommendations are a mix of Bernie Sanders for taxes, with Martin Feldstein, a Republican at Harvard, for getting rid of tax loopholes, with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, for getting rid of restrictive regulations.\nAds By Israel Book Shop:\nSubscribe to RSS Feed For This Article"

        "webpage": "Cash-Stuffed, Stingy, and Scared\nBy Steve Rosenbush Several years ago, business spending in the U.S. slammed to a neck-wrenching halt. After loading up on equipment and personnel during the stock market fueled boom of the late '90s, managers across the U.S. woke up in early 2000 and realized their companies were deep in debt and that revenues were nowhere near what the optimists had predicted. So began three years of layoffs, bankruptcies, and cost-cutting. When it came to capital budgets, the only questions were how far and how fast to cut.The brutal corporate cleanup succeeded in its own terrible way. While it wiped out a half-million jobs and $2 trillion of value in the capital markets in telecom alone, corporate ledgers were purified by fire. By some measures, balance sheets are cleaner than they've been in nearly 50 years. Thanks to cost-cutting and the low rates of interest and taxes that were necessary to reenergize the economy, corporate profits are back on track.FINANCING GAP. Businesses are literally earning more money than they're investing. Companies have so much cash, they have little use for banks. They're like well-heeled homeowners who can build a house with their own funds, skipping the mortgage.Consider: After the third quarter of 2000, businesses invested $337 billion more than they needed to spend on factory expansion and so forth, making up the difference by borrowing. But at the end of the first quarter of 2004, internally generated corporate cash flow exceeded business investment by nearly $63 billion.The reversal of this so-called financing gap is rare, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of researcher Economy.com. \"Balance sheets are in good shape, and companies are well positioned to expand and grow,\" Zandi says.OVERLOOKED PILLAR. Sure, business investment and capital spending have picked up over the last year, but they're nowhere near their potential. And CEOs aren't doing much to boost the labor market, which added an anemic 32,000 jobs in April. Unlike a few years ago, companies have the resources to spend more if they were so inclined.So, why aren't they spending? The spike in oil prices and conflicting economic data, not to mention uncertainty surrounding war, terror, and the 2004 election, leave them hesitant.All that cash is an overlooked pillar of strength for the economy. And sooner or later, companies will put it to work. \"It has to go somewhere,\" says Zandi. \"Right now, it's sitting in bank accounts and finding its way into real estate markets. But eventually, that liquidity should engender more economic activity.\"DIVIDENDS AND BUYBACKS. Executives just don't seem to know what to do with the money. Microsoft (MSFT) alone has $56 billion in cash, much of which it's returning to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. Software giant Oracle (ORCL) has about $12 billion in cash and short-term securities, which it's using to acquire other companies. Computer giant Sun Microsystems (SUNW) has $8 billion in cash, which seems destined for acquisitions. Even struggling telecom MCI (MCIP), which recently emerged from bankruptcy entered into as WorldCom, is returning $2.2 billion in cash to its shareholders. Apparently it can't find a better investment to make.Dividends and stock buybacks are great for investors in the short term, but don't necessarily lead to investment in plants and new equipment, let alone job creation. And mergers may help boost efficiency and corporate profits, but they're viewed as an opportunity to reduce capital spending, not boost it.\"IT'S GOT TO.\" Sooner or later, companies will reach the end of this unimaginative spending pattern. Just as the period of cost cuts came to an end, so will the era of buybacks and dividends. Pressed to generate more revenue, companies will begin to use their money to take risks and make investments.In the telecom sector, Verizon (VZ) is using its $13 billion capital budget, one of the largest in the world, to build a next-generation phone system that can carry video as well as voice and high-speed data. CEO Ivan G. Seidenberg summed it up nicely in an interview in 2003 when he said: \"The simple fact is that all the money that has been pumped into the market...has got to come out the other end some time. It's got to.\"When that happens, it will change the way the economy is perceived. The political implications could be huge, too. If spending picks up quickly, it could help President Bush's reelection effort. But if it doesn't happen until after November, it could help John Kerry win the White House. And just as Bush inherited an economy wrought with a stock market crash and a recession, Kerry could inherit one that is poised to grow.It's like damp timber, Zandi says. Sooner or later, the weather is going to clear and the wood is going to dry. And then that cash will be able to generate some real heat.

        "webpage": "Commentary: Robbing the poor\nShare Tweet E-mail Comments Print By Jack Lessenberry Listen A year ago, in their zeal to give businesses an enormous tax cut, the governor and the legislature considered virtually eliminating the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor. In the end, they didn't quite kill it. Instead, they merely took most of it away. When they did, there was hardly a whimper of protest from the Democrats. About the only group which seemed upset was the non-profit and non-partisan Michigan League for Human Services. Even the league seemed more relieved that the tax credit wasn't totally killed than indignant about what the government had done. When the Michigan Senate decided to \"only\" take 70 percent of the credit away, they were praised by a former senator, Gilda Jacobs, who is now president of the league. \"This measure preserves the spirit of the Michigan Earned Income Tax Credit,\" she said. Well, I have long thought that Gilda was one of the brightest lights in Lansing. But I thought then that she was being far too easy on what to me was really a public policy crime. Shrinking the credit, known at the EITC, is about as stupid a move as I can imagine. In fact, it is even stupider seen from a conservative orientation. The credit encouraged the poor to work and helped keep working families out of poverty. It put desperately needed money into their hands. But it also put even more money into the hands of Michigan businessmen, especially small businessmen. When you make it possible for the working poor to keep more of their earnings, they spend it almost immediately in the local economy. They do not park the money in the Cayman Islands. They buy stuff with it. When money is spent that way, it has what economists call a multiplier effect. According to the Anderson Economic Group, every dollar returned to the working poor generates $1.67 worth of activity. You couldn't imagine a more effective device to keep working people out of poverty. Well, now it is a new era, and yesterday, the League for Human Services released a study detailing the effect of the reduced tax credit. What it shows is that Michigan's leaders have indeed robbed from the poor to give to the rich. Three years ago, the EITC reduced taxes for working, low-income families by $344 million. This year, that will drop to $109 million. What this means is that Michigan's poorest working families are being saddled with a tax increase of almost a quarter of a billion dollars. \"Low-income families pay a larger share of their income already in sales and property taxes than do the wealthy,\" Jacobs said. Now, they will have even less money in their pockets. While this will certainly hurt impoverished Detroit, Gilda Jacobs thinks it may hit rural northern Michigan especially hard. \"Cutting the EITC may well put out of business some independent grocers, small auto repair shops and second-hand stores,\" she said. Wouldn't it be something if the governor and our legislative leaders would be statesmen enough to admit that on this issue, they were wrong? Wouldn't it restore your faith in government and human nature if they were to restore the tax credit? It certainly would mine. But don't hold your breath.

Ciattarelli believes a comprehensive review of these tax laws will lead to reforms that will make New Jersey economically vibrant and more retirement friendly. \"A cost-benefit study of the impact of our tax laws is a critical first step in making our state more competitive and a place where people want to live and retire,\" said Ciattarelli, R-Somerset, Hunterdon, Mercer and Middlesex. \"There is no question that some of our tax laws drive people out of our state. If we are serious about addressing this 'tax migration,' a coalition of scholars, economists, tax and estate planning professionals, legislators and residents is needed to analyze the issue in an informed, non-partisan and objective way.\" Ciattarelli said the need to examine these taxes is urgently needed given the demographic reality that more baby boomers are reaching retirement age. When deciding where to live after retirement, taxes play a key role. If New Jersey does not address a retiree's tax liability on his or her estate, transfer inheritance and pension, there is a better likelihood of their leaving the state for a more tax-friendly climate. Ciattarelli noted that New Jersey is one of only 15 states that imposes an estate tax and, along with Maryland, is one of only two states that have both a transfer inheritance tax and an estate tax. \"For retirees, taxes play an important part in deciding where they choose to live,\" explained Ciattarelli. \"We cannot control the appeal of the weather some states enjoy. We can, however, stop incentivizing retirees to seek legal residency in another state. One way to do this is by repealing the estate tax, the transfer inheritance tax and increasing the state's pension exclusion, for example, from $20,000 to $50,000.\" A person who declares residency in another state for six months plus one day (a majority of the year) falls under that state's tax laws. \"If we don't reform these areas of taxation, financial planners will continue to advise residents to live elsewhere for 'six plus one,'\" stated Ciattarelli. \"What is the point of having retirement tax policies that everyone is legally avoiding? Making New Jersey more tax friendly will result in people staying in our state for a longer period which is good for our economy. \"Considering that New Jersey retirees continue to pay the most punitive tax of all - the property tax - we owe it to ourselves to have a public discussion on how to achieve fairness and make New Jersey more retirement friendly,\" explained Ciattarelli. \"I look forward to the OLS analysis and will follow up with three or four public forums, in connection with New Jersey universities, to discuss this important and very timely topic.\" Ciattarelli also announced that he intends to request similar comprehensive study packages from OLS on the State's capital gains tax laws and public sector personnel policies that directly impact property taxes. ### On the Net:  NJ Assembly Republicans on Facebook NJ Assembly Republicans on Twitter"

        "webpage": "By PAUL KRUGMAN New York Times\nA few weeks ago I tried to explain the logic of Bush-style Social Security privatization: it is, in effect, as if your financial adviser told you that you wouldn't have enough money when you retire - but you shouldn't save more. Instead, you should borrow a lot of money, buy stocks and hope for capital gains.\nBefore President Bush's big speech, a background briefing by a \"senior administration official\" made it clear that the plan calls for exactly the \"borrow, speculate and hope\" strategy I described - not just for the system as a whole, but for each individual.\nHere's the money quote: \"In return for the opportunity to get the benefits from the personal account, the person forgoes a certain amount of benefits from the traditional system. Now, the way that election is structured, the person comes out ahead if their personal account exceeds a 3 percent rate of return\" - after inflation - \"which is the rate of return that the trust fund bonds receive. So, basically, the net effect on an individual's benefits would be zero if his personal account earned a 3 percent rate of return.\"\nTranslation: If you put part of your payroll taxes into a personal account, your future benefits will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the amount you would have had to repay if you had borrowed the money at a real interest rate of 3 percent.\nPeter Orszag of the Brookings Institution got it exactly right: \"It's not a nest egg. It's a loan.\" For years, privatizers - including Mr. Bush - have claimed that people would do better with private accounts than with traditional Social Security even if they played it safe and invested in U.S. government bonds (which yield 3 percent after inflation).\nBut the official at the briefing made it clear that his boss was fibbing: if you invested your private account in government bonds, you would face benefit cuts equal in value to your investment, so you would be no better off than under the current system.\nThe only way to get ahead would be to invest in risky assets like stocks, and hope for higher yields. But if the investment went wrong and you earned less than 3 percent after inflation, your benefit cuts would leave you poorer than if you had never opened that private account. So people are expected to take a loan from the government and use it to buy stocks, and if that turns out to have been a mistake - well, too bad. Experts usually tell people to plan for their retirement by investing in a mix of stocks and bonds. They disapprove strongly of speculation on margin: borrowing to buy stocks. Yet Mr. Bush wants tens of millions of Americans to do exactly that.\nMeanwhile, what does any of this have to do with the ostensible purpose of the whole thing: saving Social Security?\nHere's the senior official again: \"In a long-term sense, the personal accounts would have a net neutral effect on the fiscal situation of Social Security.\" The government would have to borrow huge sums up front to create the personal accounts - $4.5 trillion in the first two decades - but it would supposedly make up for all that borrowing with offsetting cuts in account holders' benefits many decades later. Color me skeptical: will retirees with private accounts that performed badly really be forced to repay their loans in full? Even if they are, private accounts will at best have a \"net neutral effect\" - that is, they will do nothing to improve Social Security's finances. Mr. Bush says the system faces a crisis; what does he propose to do about it?\nThe answer, presumably, is that his plan will also involve major benefit cuts over and above those associated with private accounts. And it's true that you can improve Social Security's finances with privatization, as long as you also slash benefits - just as you can kill a flock of sheep with witchcraft, provided you also feed them arsenic. (Thanks, M. Voltaire.)\nDo you believe that we should replace America's most successful government program with a system in which workers engage in speculation that no financial adviser would recommend? Do you believe that we should do this even though it will do nothing to improve the program's finances? If so, George Bush has a deal for you. E-mail:"

While banks understand the benefits of using more modern systems, they often shy away from the transition because of its complex process. Transforming core banking systems often involves a multi-year, multi-phase makeover that can be costly and time intensive. Additionally, where banks are expected to provide their services 24/7, replacing these core systems can significantly impact their ability to service their customers. Also, in recent years, financial institutions have experienced a significant increase in regulatory requirements, making it more cumbersome than ever to properly integrate these new systems onto their platforms.\nHowever, banks do not have the option to put off this core system transformation for much longer. The economics of the industry are no longer allowing these financial institutions to continue to delay this inevitable renovation, as the benefits far outweigh the negatives. Modern banking systems allow banks to be more flexible and enable them to act more efficiently in response to the changing market opportunities. For example, on a newer, more modern system, banks have the capabilities to launch products more quickly by reusing already existing components rather than having to replace individual parts on legacy systems. Unlike legacy systems, modern systems also allow banks to have a single and complete view of the customer in real- time. Finally, research has shown that banks that stay on these legacy systems ultimately spend more money trying to upgrade their systems piece by piece than they would if embraced a newer, more modern platform. [The challenges of core systems modernization projects: Pride and Prejudice and Core Systems]\nNot surprisingly, banking institutions worldwide are investing in technologies that help them modernize their existing systems. For example, Indian banks went through this complicated process between 2004 and 2008. Now, five years later, all of these banks are on real-time views, are heavily involved in e-banking, have reduced process turnaround and are better at understanding customer insight. Banks in China, Eastern Europe and the EU market also are undergoing this major transformation, which shows that this is truly a global transformation for the banking industry.\nRecent research also has indicated that the global banking industry could regain a significant proportion of the profitability lost during the financial crisis by adopting these new modern-day systems. According to new research by Temenos and Deloitte, the implementation of modern banking platforms could close the gap by as much as 60%, or US $180 billion. Over the past three years alone, banks that have adopted these new modern platforms have experienced on average 25% higher return on assets and a 37% higher return on capital compared to banks that are still running on their legacy applications.\nOnce financial institutions realize that this change needs to occur, they can begin the replacement process. This typically begins with building a business case. A bank must identify the specific problems that need to be solved to ensure it is receiving a valuable return on investment. For example, banks should ensure that they replace their existing systems with a centralized platform that can deliver speed to market and is more flexible and accountable. It is no secret that replacing your bank's core legacy system is a major endeavor for any bank to undertake. However, it does not have to be as challenging and costly as many assume. By investing the right resources into modernizing these systems, banking institutions can not only save money but also advance their customer offerings.

        "webpage": "E-mail Print Comments Share Tweet Google+ Economy 6 Things Surnames Can Say About Social Mobility Originally published on Tue October 16, 2012 3:31 pm By Dustin Dwyer iStockphoto.com\nUsing data on surnames dating back almost 1,000 years, economic historian Gregory Clark says he's found evidence that families rise and fall across generations at a much slower rate than anyone previously thought. And he says that rate remains constant across national boundaries and time periods. Clark is writing a book about his research, and he says he's still working out some of his conclusions, but here are six possible takeaways from what he's found so far: 1. Some names are more informative than others. Much of Clark's research comes from rare surnames. In some cases, only a few dozen people might have the name in any country. Names like Bazalgette or Pepys are very elite names in England. But extremely common names also tell Clark a lot. Names like Smith or Baker started out as working-class names. Using the records at Oxford and Cambridge, Clark was able to figure out when those names reached average representation among the elites. You can also use names to identify minority groups. For example, 90 percent of people in the United States who have the name Washington are African-American. But not every name is interesting. I asked Clark to look at my name. We found out that there is nothing special about Dwyers. 2. Swedish bus drivers have it made. Part of the reason Clark's data is so different from what other researchers have found is that income is not always a good measure of a person's status. For example, many previous studies have shown that Sweden has a high level of mobility compared with other countries. Clark says that's because Sweden has much less income disparity. On average, Swedish doctors make less money than doctors in the U.S., and Swedish bus drivers make more. Clark's point is, in terms of class standing, a bus driver is a bus driver. Still, if you're a Swedish bus driver, the extra income probably seems like a good thing. 3. India is the outlier. Clark's research shows a remarkable consistency for social mobility rates around the world, with one exception: India. Families in India seem to be stuck in their class group for longer than in other countries. The obvious explanation for this is India's historic caste system. Clark looked at surnames in West Bengal and found that policies to undo the effects of the caste system have helped some groups. But the overall rate of mobility is still very low compared with the rest of the world. Clark believes that's because people in India still tend to marry within their class group. 4. The effects of slavery in the U.S. will finally fade away  -  in a few hundred years. By showing that social mobility happens much more slowly than previously thought, Clark makes a strong case for why the effects of slavery are still with us. The good news in Clark's research is that African-American families seem to be climbing the social ladder as quickly as other groups in the U.S. today. But his model predicts it will take a long time before we can say we've actually moved beyond slavery. It might happen sometime in the 2300s. 5. French-Canadian immigrants are a disadvantaged minority in the U.S. Clark says there was a substantial immigration of French-Canadians into the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th century. This is a distinct group from the descendants of French immigrants you might find in Louisiana, and Clark says you can track them through names like Gagnon, Hebert and Cote. \"Only half as many people from French-Canadian origin are doctors than you would expect,\" Clark says. \"Half as many are attorneys.\" This leads to one of the benefits of using surnames to track status, according to Clark. \"You can discover kind of underprivileged groups within a society that people in general would probably not even have recognized,\" he says. 6. Your ancestors may determine your fate, but you still need to get out of bed in the morning. \"Social mobility in some sense, it gets to one of the fundamental things that we think about,\" says Clark. \"Which is, what is the nature of human agency, and what is it to be a person in a society where eventually a lot of things may just be predictable about us?\" Clark says that as much as 60 percent of your outcome in life may be determined by your lineage. To some, that's a depressing number. But, remember, Clark is describing a model within which there can be a lot of variation. And even if you come from a long line of rich doctors, you still have to do the work if you want to be a doctor too.Copyright 2013 Michigan Radio. To see more, visit . View the discussion thread."

        "webpage": "Is ObamaCare Causing the Jobless Recovery?\nBy John Goodman Filed under Health Alerts on July 16, 2012 with 15 comments Take a look at the chart below. Public uncertainty about federal economic policy under the Obama presidency is higher than it has been in 30 years.\nEconomists at Stanford University and the University of Chicago have actually discovered a way of measuring how uncertain people are. They find that their measure of uncertainty correlates with such economic activities as deciding to invest, deciding how much to produce and deciding whether to hire more workers.\nOne source of uncertainty is what will happen next January when American taxpayers will be hit with a large tax increase (mainly the expiration of the Bush tax cuts) and a major decrease in government spending (the result of last year's budget deal). Will President Obama and the Congress agree to put off the tax increases? Will they agree to delay the spending cuts? Not knowing the answers to those questions appears to have more impact on the decisions of businesses and consumers than if everyone simply agreed to go ahead and let the bad things happen.\nSome causes of uncertainty (such as the crisis with in the Eurozone) are not under President Obama's control. But in other areas, he is directly responsible for creating anxiety for the business community and the public. Three policies jump out: Dodd-Frank financial regulation, an unhealthy desire to tax capital, and ObamaCare.\nOverall, the economists calculate public policy uncertainty is the apparent cause of a 3.2% drop in real gross domestic product, a 16% decline in private investment and the loss of 2.3 million jobs over the past five years.\nUncertainty is one of the reasons employers are not hiring like they have at the end of past recessions. When an employer hires a full-time worker, the employer thinks of the relationship as long term. During an initial training and learning period, the employer probably pays out more in wages and benefits than the company gets back in production. But over a longer period, the hope is to turn that around and make a profit.\nWhen employers hire new employees, they are making a gamble. They are betting that, over time, the economics of the relationship will pan out.\nThe problem in the current economy is that hiring new workers and committing to new production has become risky. An employer who hires workers today has no way of knowing the company's future labor costs; its building and facility costs; its cost of capital; or its taxes.\nTake the cost of ObamaCare. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the average annual cost of a minimum benefit package at $4,500 to $5,000 for individuals and $12,000 to $12,500 for families in 2016. That translates into a minimum health benefit of $2.28 an hour for individual coverage and $5.89 an hour for family coverage.\nIn another year and a half, the minimum cost of labor will be a $7.25 cash minimum wage and a $5.89 health minimum wage (family), for a total of $13.14 an hour or about $27,331 a year. You can see already that few firms are going to want to hire low-wage workers with families.\nEmployers could decide to drop their health insurance altogether; and if they do so they must pay a fine of $2,000 per employee per year. Yet if a lot of employers do this (and apparently a lot of them are thinking about it), it is likely the federal government will respond by making the fine a lot higher.\nThe jobs numbers tell two different stories, as the second graph shows. In terms of hours worked, the labor market has recovered. But in terms of the actual number of people working, we haven't even started to recover. People with jobs are working just as many hours as they did before the recession began. This is consistent with the incentives under ObamaCare: Nothing happens to the employers' health care costs if people work additional hours. However, there is a substantial increase in health care costs, if the employer hires one more worker. This may be the reason for the jobless recovery.\nI testified this week at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on this subject of economic uncertainty and the role ObamaCare plays. In addition, my new book, Priceless, explains how to dismantle and replace ObamaCare."

Our retail banks - as independent research has shown - also already provide customers with more choice, greater protection and offer better value for money than in other countries.\"\nAs well as Sir John, the ICB is also made up of Clare Spottiswoode, the former director-general of Ofgas, Martin Taylor, a former chief executive of Barclays, Bill Winters, the former co-chief executive of JP Morgan, and Martin Wolf, the chief economics commentator at the Financial Times.

The authoritarian communist country has outlined a plan to deregulate state-owned companies and attract more foreign investment that brings technology, financing and jobs to the island, Vice President of the Council of Ministers Marino Murillo announced on Tuesday.\n\"We will be working for deep reforms for the rest of the year and well into the next,\" Murillo, who is in charge of the reform commission, told Reuters. \"The very first step has been to eliminate prohibitions and restrictions.\"\nMurillo said that the government was planning to give companies more autonomy and give entrepreneurs more freedom to grow. He clarified, however, that \"the model of the revolution is based in social propriety, and not private, even though the latter creates jobs.\"\nThe plan is to allow state-owned companies to keep 50 percent of profits, after taxes, and then reinvest them in production. Up to now, all profits went to the government.\nNews agency Prensa Latina reports that reforms include shutting down all companies that lose money for more than two years. \"Our goal is to improve business efficiency and finish with the debt that has been dragging our economy down,\" Murillo said.\nThe other key aspect of the reform is to open the country to foreign investment. \"We are aware that our island needs more foreign investment,\" Murillo admitted. He specified, nonetheless, that the government will only welcome foreign companies that bring technology, financing and jobs.\nThere is one particular group of investors the government is hoping to attract: Cubans abroad. Llanio Gonzalez, consul in the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, said that the reforms will make it easier for Cuban families who emigrated to the U.S. to move back or invest in the country from afar.\n\"Our country is in a process of huge change, not only economic but also political. And in the new foreign investment law, all Cubans are of course included,\" the diplomat said to a group of expats who have been lobbying against the embargo from exile. Gonzalez met up with several expat groups in Miami on Sunday and exposed the conditions in which the reforms on immigration from 2010 can help them invest in their home country.\nGonzalez sustains that it is not the Cuban government that does not allow the return of Cuban expats, but the U.S. embargo on Cuba. \"Cubans living abroad have been included in investment laws, but the embargo laws do not allow you to adhere to [its] provisions,\" he said. Havana's new strategy is to turn around the effects of this policies, through an immigration reform that went into effect in January, which allows Cubans living in the U.S. to stay on the island for three months at a time. \"Right now, many people live in both places at the same time, they come and go, come and go. We want more expats to join the trend,\" Gonzalez said.\nThese may the first stages of a more open Cuba, making its first attempt at foreign investment and private entrepreneurship. The Cuban economy experienced a 2.3 percent growth in GDP in the first half of 2013, according to the Ministry of Economy.\nThe World Bank does not have an estimate for the Cuban economy due to lack of data.\nSnowden Misses Flight To Havana, Hasn't Been Seen Publicly Since Moscow Arrival By Angelo Young Where in the world is Edward Snowden?

The same thing that draws the person to teach accounting and business ethics nationwide, serve as an area governor for Toastmasters, and even swing dance on a weekly basis: a natural drive and sense of curiosity.\nThe Edge sat down with Elizabeth Pittelkow, CPA.CITP, CGMA, a 2013 graduate of the AICPA Leadership Academy, to learn a bit more about what makes this unique young woman tick.\nWearing a Variety of Hats\nA senior accounting manager with ArrowStream, Inc., Elizabeth was drawn to the small company through a desire to help it grow, and she is appreciative that the company allows her to spread her wings. In her current role, she oversees Accounts Receivable, manages the financial policies for the company, and performs month-end reporting and controls testing. She also manages shareholder relations and her interest in the risk management side of finance has her managing insurance for the company.\nAnother one of Elizabeth's interests is in marketing, so she helps ArrowStream with marketing and public relations by reviewing press releases, writing blogs, and editing. As if that is not enough, she is also co-founder of the company's Business Continuity Committee, organizes company philanthropic endeavors, and serves as the president of the company's Toastmasters chapter.\n\"When I left PwC, I thought I would end up at another big company, she said. \"However, I landed at a small private company because I loved the mix of meaningful projects and skilled people collaborating on them.\"\nA graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Elizabeth continued the family tradition of finance, albeit the first female in her family to do so. She ended up falling in love with accounting after her first class, and graduated with both accounting and finance degrees. She now enjoys serving as a business career mentor for several students at the University of Illinois to help guide them in their academic journeys and show them potential career paths.\n\"IT, economics, business valuations, forensics, and more; there are so many avenues available to accountants that I did not know as a student,\" she said. \"We are not boxed in as accountants if we do not want to be.\" The Ethical Choice\nElizabeth refuses to be boxed in. Her natural curiosity and drive inspire her to volunteer in a variety of venues that have opened up further opportunities. For example, her involvement in the Illinois CPA Society's Ethics Committee led to her teaching ethics classes at the state and national levels. \"The research is fascinating as to why fraud happens and why seemingly ethical people make unethical decisions.\" said Elizabeth, who taught a class with an accountant who was arrested and served jail time for fraud. \"Frequently, fraud is committed to protect people. An error temporarily fixed to protect the shareholders can quickly and unintentionally turn into fraud. In most cases, there are many people involved in cases of fraud. The issue is that no one steps up to say, 'Hey, I do not feel comfortable with these actions!'\" AICPA Leadership Academy\nNaturally, Elizabeth's drive navigated her interest toward attending the AICPA Leadership Academy.\n\"I wanted to build my leadership skills and to connect with people from around the country of similar ages and career situations,\" said Elizabeth who, as with everything Elizabeth does, spent time researching and analyzing before applying to the Leadership Academy. \"I watched the great informational video on the AICPA website, and then I started looking on LinkedIn for people who had attended the Leadership Academy in the past. They looked so impressive and are my accounting heroes! I wanted to live similar experiences and grow my career in similar ways.\" The Leadership Academy had a lasting impression on Elizabeth, especially the positive psychology PERMA model taught there, which helps humans flourish in their overall well being, to reframe negative thoughts, be more positive, and think about how to manage \"drains\" that zap energy and happiness. She hopes to teach this PERMA model at her own company in the near future.\nSumming It All Up\nElizabeth's varied interests lead her in a variety of directions daily and keep her challenging herself.\n\"During the Leadership Academy, we were asked to identify activities that make us happy,\" she said. When asked to sum up her favorite activities, she admits it was hard to choose between her interest in business ethics, Toastmasters, and her love of swing dancing. \"Reflecting on my friends and experiences from the Leadership Academy now makes me really happy, too!\"\nHave your interests given you additional career opportunities?

        "webpage": "Debt consolidation entails taking out one loan to pay off many others. This is often done to secure a lower interest rate, secure a fixed interest rate or for the convenience of servicing only one loan.\n\nDebt consolidation can simply be from a number of unsecured loans into another unsecured loan, but more often it involves a secured loan against an asset that serves as collateral, which is most commonly a house (in this case a mortgage is secured against the house.) The collateralization of the loan allows a lower interest rate than without it, because by collateralizing, the asset owner agrees to allow the forced sale (foreclosure) of the asset in order to pay back the loan. The risk to the lender is reduced so the interest rate offered is lower.\n\nSometimes, debt consolidation companies can discount the amount of the loan. When the debtor is in danger of bankruptcy, the debt consolidator will buy the loan at a discount.\n\nA prudent debtor can shop around for consolidators who will pass along some of the savings. Consolidation can affect the ability of the debtor to discharge debts in bankruptcy, so the decision to consolidate must be weighed carefully.\n\nDebt consolidation is often advisable in theory when someone is paying credit card debt. Credit cards can carry a much larger interest rate than even an unsecured loan from a bank. Debtors with property such as a home or car may get a lower rate through a secured loan using their property as collateral. Then the total interest and the total cash flow paid towards the debt is lower allowing the debt to be paid off sooner, incurring less interest.\n\nIn practice, many people are in credit card debt because they spend more than their income. If that habit continues, the consolidation will not benefit them much because they will simply increase their credit card balances again.\n\nBecause of the theoretical advantage that debt consolidation offers a consumer that has high interest debt balances, companies can take advantage of that benefit of refinancing to charge very high fees in the debt consolidation loan. Sometimes these fees are near the state maximum for mortgage fees.\n\nIn addition, some unscrupulous companies will knowingly wait until a client has backed themselves into a corner and must refinance in order to consolidate and pay off bills that they are behind on the payments. If the client does not refinance they may lose their house, so they are willing to pay any allowable fee to complete the debt consolidation.\n\nIn some cases the situation is that the client does not have enough time to shop for another lender with lower fees and may not even be fully aware of them. This practice is known as predatory lending. Certainly many, if not most, debt consolidation transactions do not involve predatory lending."

This is nearly a full percentage point higher than in the nation as a whole, and about twice the jobless rate seen in the 25- to 54-year-old age group in Connecticut.\u2022 Only 54.5 percent of the state's youngest workers have jobs or are looking for employment. This compares to a 62 percent labor-participation rate just five years earlier, demonstrating that many young workers have given up on finding a job or have gone back to school.\u2022 Connecticut had the second-highest rate of young workers who experienced long-term unemployment among all 50 states. About one-third of young jobless workers had been unemployed for more than 26 weeks, compared with a national average of 27.7 percent.\"The health of our common economic future will depend on our success in broadening economic opportunities for young workers,\" Orlando Rodriguez, senior policy fellow at Connecticut Voices for Children and co-author of the report, said in a statement.\"We urgently need a renewed commitment to supporting youth to get Connecticut back on track to a prosperous future,\" co-author Edie Joseph, a policy fellow at Connecticut Voices, added in a statement.Michael Sullivan, communications director for Connecticut Voices, said in a teleconference that tying the minimum wage to inflation would help those on the lower rung of the economic scale, but a more comprehensive look at the state's job opportunities is required to address the fact that the state continues to replace lost high-wage jobs with new low-wage work.\"It's not just the number of jobs, it's the type of job,\" he said.The report recommended three ways the state can help younger workers:\u2022 Guarantee access to high-quality education from kindergarten through 12th grade by increasing school funding to close achievement gaps.\u2022 Increase access to higher education and job training related to growing industries.\u2022 Provide programs such as rental assistance, affordable housing and earned income tax credits that help low-income workers, hold down poverty levels and support families.The report also noted that the state's black and Hispanic workers continue to suffer from high unemployment combined with low wages. Hispanics earned 55 cents for every dollar paid to a white worker in the state, according to the report, while blacks made 72 cents on the dollar.Black and Hispanic unemployment were about double the rate seen among the white population, the report said.\"These disparities in economic opportunity are troubling for the economic future of the state,\" a report summary"

Transcript AUDIE CORNISH, BYLINE: President Obama says he's looking for ways to stop the spread of corporate inversions. Here's how they work. A U.S. corporation merges with a smaller foreign company, then moves its legal headquarters overseas to lower its tax rate. But as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, there are limits to what the administration can do to discourage these transactions without the approval of Congress, and that's unlikely to anytime soon. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: The number of corporate inversions is small. The Congressional Research Service says just about a dozen were in the works at the end of May. But some big companies such as Medtronic are pursuing the strategy, and Edward Kleinbard of the University of Southern California says the phenomenon is growing. EDWARD KLEINBARD: It's a very attractive technique, and that's the reason why one might expect exponential growth if left unchecked. ZARROLI: There's nothing illegal about inversions. Congress passed a law in 1994 that set limits on corporations looking to move overseas. Kleinbard, author of the book, \"We Are Better Than This,\" says the law was probably too lax and helped make the current surge in inversions possible. But until the law gets rewritten, there's not a lot that can be done about it. KLEINBARD: That is a rule that Congress, as keeper of the tax model - Congress, in my view, alone, can change. ZARROLI: The problem is that in the current political climate, Congress has shown little desire to deal with the issue. Republicans have made clear they will address the problem only in the context of broader reform that lowers corporate tax rates, which they say are way too high. The Obama Administration first said there was little it could do to stop inversions without the help of Congress. More recently President Obama has said he's looking for ways to discourage inversions within the scope of current law. Here he was at a press conference last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: What we are doing is examining are there elements to how existing statutes are interpreted by rule, or by regulation, or tradition, or practice that can at least discourage some of the folks who maybe are trying to take advantage of this loophole. ZARROLI: The administration appears to have some steps it can take on its own. It might bar companies that do inversions from getting federal contracts. It also might challenge some of the tax avoidance strategies that such companies use, such as shifting money from one foreign subsidiary to another and calling it a loan. Lee Sheppard, contributing editor of Tax Notes says that kind of aggressive treatment by the IRS could discourage some inversions. LEE SHEPPARD: When the administration comes and he says we're going to make it difficult, and we're going to make your accountants look twice at it - that, you know, sort of throws a monkey wrench into things. ZARROLI: But Sheppard also says there are real limits to what the administration can do because federal law sets the bar for inversions pretty low. She also believes the current focus on inversions could bring about a sudden surge in new deals. Even now she says lawyers and hedge fund executives are going to corporate chief executives and telling them... SHEPPARD: You really got to think about this thing because if you don't do it now, they're going to fix the laws and you won't be able to do it all if you ever thought you wanted to do it. It's kind of like, buy now. You know, stuff's on sale. ZARROLI: Sheppard says for various reasons, inversions just aren't right for many companies. But until the law is changed, companies that can carry out such deals will be tempted to do so. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. \u00a9 2015 KTEP"

        "webpage": "ADVERTISEMENT Barrie Maguire \u2022 NewsArt, Is wealth inequality reaching a tipping point? Article by: Mark Buchanan\nWe know that inequality is on the rise around the world. The richest 1 percent commands almost half of the planet's household wealth, while the poorest half has less than 1 percent. We know a lot less about why this is happening  -  and where it might lead.\nSome argue that technological advancement drives income disproportionately to those with the right knowledge and skills. Others point to the explosive growth in the financial sector. Liberals worry that extreme inequality will tear society apart. Conservatives argue that the wealth of the rich inspires others to succeed.\nWhat if we could shed all of our political prejudices and take a more scientific approach, setting up an experimental world where we could test our thinking about what drives inequality? Crazy as this might sound, it has been done. And the results are worth pondering.\nImagine a world like our own, only greatly simplified. Everyone has equal talent and starts out with the same wealth. Each person can gain or lose wealth by interacting and exchanging goods and services with others, or by making investments that earn uncertain returns.\nMore than a decade ago, some scientists set up such a world in a computer and used it to run simulations examining fundamental aspects of wealth dynamics. They found several surprising things.\nFirst, inequality was unavoidable: A small fraction of individuals (say 20 percent) always came to possess a large fraction (say 80 percent) of the total wealth. This happened because some individuals were luckier than others. By chance alone, some peoples' investments paid off many times in a row. The more wealth they had, the more they could invest, making bigger future gains even more likely.\nFor those who worry about the corrosive effects of wealth inequality on social cohesion and democracy, the idea that it follows almost inexorably from the most basic features of modern economies might be unnerving. But there it is. A small fraction owning most of everything is just as natural as having mountains on a planet with plate tectonics.\nSuppose we reach into this experimental world and  -  by adjusting tax incentives or other means  -  boost the role of financial investment relative to simple economic exchange. What happens then? The distribution of wealth becomes more unequal: The wealth share of the top 20 percent goes from, say, 80 percent to 90 percent.\nIf you keep boosting the role of finance and investment, something surprising happens. Inequality doesn't just keep growing in a gradual and continuous way. Rather, the economy crosses an abrupt tipping point. Suddenly, a few individuals end up owning everything.\nThis would be a profoundly different world. It's one thing to have much of the wealth belonging to a small fraction of the world's population  -  1 percent is still about 70 million people. It's entirely another if a small number of people  -  say, five or eight  -  hold most of the wealth.\nWith such a chasm between the poor and the rich, the idea that a person could go from one group to the other in a lifetime, or even in a number of generations, becomes absurd. The sheer numbers make the probability vanishingly small.\nAre we headed toward such a world? Well, data from Bloomberg and the bank Credit Suisse suggest that the planet's 138 richest people currently command more wealth than the roughly 3.5 billion who make up the poorest half of the population. Of course, nobody can say whether that means we've reached a tipping point or are nearing one.\nExperimental worlds are useful in that they exploit the power of computation to examine the likely consequences of complex interactions that otherwise would overwhelm our analytical skills. We can get at least a little insight into what might happen, what we ought to expect.\nOur experimental world suggests that today's vast wealth inequality probably isn't the result of any economic conspiracy or of vast differences in human skills. It's more likely the banal outcome of a fairly mechanical process  -  one that, unless we find some way to alter its course, could easily carry us into a place where most of us would rather not be.\nMark Buchanan, a physicist and the author of \"Forecast: What Physics, Meteorology and the Natural Sciences Can Teach Us About Economics,\" is a Bloomberg View columnist."

        "webpage": "Financial Times: Piketty's Data Is Full of Errors\nSlateMoneyboxA blog about business and economics.May 23 2014 4:31 PM\nBy Jordan Weissmann\nTime for some answers, Thomas.\nPhoto by LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images\nHoo boy. The Financial Times just came out guns blazing with a report claiming that the numbers contained in Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century are, well, wrong, and possibly manipulated. Here's the charge:\nThe data underpinning Professor Piketty's 577-page tome, which has dominated best-seller lists in recent weeks, contain a series of errors that skew his findings. The FT found mistakes and unexplained entries in his spreadsheets, similar to those which last year undermined the work on public debt and growth of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff.\nThe central theme of Prof Piketty's work is that wealth inequalities are heading back up to levels last seen before the first world war. The investigation undercuts this claim, indicating there is little evidence in Prof Piketty's original sources to bear out the thesis that an increasing share of total wealth is held by the richest few.\nInvoking Reinhart and Rogoff - whose famous work on the effects of national debt on GDP growth was undermined, in part, by the world's most famous Excel spreadsheet error - is a bit bold here. Already, conservative thinker and Slate contributor Reihan Salam says the paper may be \"overstating its case.\" The FT's main complaint seems to be that Piketty's work is based on a patchwork of historical data sources - all of which he has made available online - and in order to smooth the numbers over time, he's made adjustments they find dubious or inexplicable. In some cases there may even be straightforward transcription errors. Most seriously, they claim, \"Some numbers appear simply to be constructed out of thin air.\"\nBut as Matt Yglesias notes, their disagreements about some countries seem fairly minor. Here, for instance, is the data on France, with Piketty's trend line in blue and the FT's corrected version in red. In the end, they basically overlap. (You can find this graph, and the FT's more detailed explanation of its conclusions, here).\nHowever, the paper does level two somewhat serious accusations. First, it says Piketty has covered up a giant gap in America's historical records on wealth concentration. \"There is simply no data between 1870 and 1960,\" the newspaper states. \"Yet, Prof. Piketty chooses to derive a trend.\" This charge is neutered a bit by the fact that Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez recently released a detailed analysis of U.S. wealth inequality dating back to 1913 that shows an even more dramatic increase than what Piketty found. But Piketty will nonetheless need to spell out how he reached his own conclusions in a bit more detail.\nThe much more important point of contention is Great Britain. The FT argues that Piketty's graphs simply \"do not match\" his underlying data on the UK, and that official estimates show no significant increase in the country's concentration of wealth since the 1970s.\nOnce Britain's corrected data is included in the picture, the FT argues, the evidence that wealth inequality is growing across Europe disappears. Here's how they envision the rather less dramatic trend lines:\nSo far, Piketty has only offered a somewhat vague response. It basically boils down to: \"This stuff is complicated, but I'm trying to be as transparent as possible.\" Here's the meat of it:\nFor the time being, we have to do with what we have, that is, a very diverse and heterogeneous set of data sources on wealth: historical inheritance declarations and estate tax statistics, scarce property and wealth tax data, and household surveys with self-reported data on wealth (with typically a lot of under-reporting at the top). As I make clear in the book, in the on-line appendix, and in the many technical papers I have published on this topic, one needs to make a number of adjustments to the raw data sources so as to make them more homogenous over time and across countries. I have tried in the context of this book to make the most justified choices and arbitrages about data sources and adjustments. I have no doubt that my historical data series can be improved and will be improved in the future (this is why I put everything on line). It's a bit early to draw conclusions about the FT's report. But the disagreement over Britain is jarring. And given that Piketty's book is seeking to make universal claims about the nature of capitalism, he's going to need to provide a more detailed rebuttal.

        "webpage": "No Need to Rush New Money-Market Fund Regulations\nOver the past three years, the Journal has published six editorials on money-market funds. By the time we saw the latest (\"The SEC's Big Chance,\" Review & Outlook, Feb. 21), we were shaking our heads in disbelief. As Ronald Reagan once said, \"There you go again.\" The misleading assertions start with the notion that \"taxpayers have been waiting years\" for the Securities and Exchange Commission to reform money funds. We refer readers to the SEC's Jan. 27, 2010 press release \"SEC Approves Money Market Fund Reforms to Better Protect Investors\" outlining a sweeping set of measures that have already proved to make these funds more resilient. The editorial's core argument is that money funds use an \"accounting fiction\" to maintain a stable value. But under GAAP, amortized cost accounting commonly is used by financial and nonfinancial firms to value short-term, high-quality assets. Detailed disclosures show that money-market funds' mark-to-market values seldom vary from $1 by more than one-hundredth of a cent. We do agree that the SEC is the appropriate agency to consider any further changes. The SEC moved swiftly to make reforms in 2010. Last summer, a bipartisan majority resisted former Chairman Mary Schapiro's\nrushed proposals because commissioners wanted data to analyze the effects of those reforms. The commissioners now have that study and have said they are moving steadily ahead. Such a thoughtful approach to regulation is to be applauded - not scorned. Paul Schott Stevens President and CEO Investment Company Institute Washington I disagree with the implication that the involvement of the Financial Stability Oversight Council is the necessary impetus for the SEC to act. Former Chairman Schapiro, rather than negotiating with her reform-minded but cautious fellow SEC commissioners, called in reinforcements - her colleagues on the FSOC. The beauty of the SEC's structure is that it forces the chairman to work with - not shut out - her colleagues. Ms. Schapiro's decision to invoke a higher power - which Dodd-Frank would have us believe the Financial Stability Oversight Council is - set a terrible precedent for future SEC chairmen in difficult negotiations, and for the FSOC as it prepares to meddle in as many corners of the economy as it can. The FSOC could better devote its time and cross-regulatory expertise to sorting through the complicated accounting and tax issues associated with floating money-market funds' net asset value. Doing so would form the basis for future cooperation in resolving technical issues that cut across multiple jurisdictions, while leaving independent regulatory commissions to work through their own disagreements.

The news came as the overall unemployment rate yesterday rose to a 16-year high of 8.4 per cent of the workforce.\n\nIn total unemployment jumped by 48,000, to 2.67million, at the end of last year.\n\nThe figures also showed a record number are working part-time - up by 83,000 to 1.35million. Again the effect is felt most among women, according to the ONS, with around 750,000 saying they 'could not find a full-time job'.\n\nAs a result, they are doing jobs which are typically poorly paid and at a level which is far below their skill and experience. Yvette Cooper, Labour's shadow minister for women, last night accused the Coalition of having 'a blind spot on women' and urged ministers to 'change tack'.\n\nCriticisms: Yvette Cooper\n\nShe said: 'More women are being forced out of work and back into the home by a combination of cuts to jobs and childcare.'\n\nGraeme Cooke, an associate director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, said: 'Women are bearing the brunt of rising unemployment.'\n\nThe timing could not be worse, in particular for the older generation of working women who are also being hit by the Government's decision to rapidly increase the State pension age.\n\nNearly six unemployed are chasing every job vacancy, with the overall toll of unemployed increasing by around one million since the credit crunch began in 2007.\n\nExperts said they were alarmed by the fact around one in three of those unemployed has been out of a job for more than 12 months.\n\nOf the 2.67million total, the ONS said 860,000 have been trying to find work for more than a year.\n\nDr John Philpott, chief economic adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said the UK jobs market is experiencing 'a slow, painful contraction'.\n\nHe added: 'Unemployment will crawl towards three million by the end of the year, rather than a sudden surge of joblessness.' And Nida Ali, economic adviser to the accountants Ernst & Young's ITEM Club, said: 'The labour market outlook is still pretty dismal.'\n\nOverall, employment rose between October and December by 60,000 to 29.1million, largely driven by part-time positions being filled.\n\nLord Freud, the minister for welfare reform, said that it was a sign the private sector is 'still creating jobs', but admitted competition for work is 'tough'.\n\nAnna Bird, acting chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the rise in women's unemployment was 'turning back time' on equality, adding: 'These new figures must act as a wake-up call to Government - we are in a time of crisis."

        "webpage": "Insights and Innovations From Binghamton University\nDecember 22, 2014 Features\nMore Features 'Lucky' numbers make for unlucky customers\nBy Rachel CokerPublished on March 16, 2012\nChinese consumers pay too much for goods and services because of superstitions surrounding particular numbers, Binghamton University economist Zili Yang says.\nIn a study published recently by The Journal of Socio-Economics, Yang reports that an aversion to the number 4, combined with a preference for the numbers 6 and 8, may translate into a \"surcharge\" of as much as 1.4 percent of China's gross domestic product.\nIn China, the world's second-largest economy, superstition plays an important role in the pricing of consumer goods. The number 4 shares the same sound as \"death\" in Chinese; 6 is a lucky number that represents \"smooth\"; and the number 8 sounds like the word \"prosperity\" in Chinese.\nIt's not uncommon for a culture to have such preferences, Yang notes: Consider Americans' aversion to the number 13. The difference is that the Chinese superstition has significant economic implications.\nYang, who grew up in China and travels there several times a year, had made casual observations about the effect of these superstitions in the past. When he set out to test his theory, he hired someone to collect random prices from Chinese shops without telling him what kind of research he was doing. In the end, Yang analyzed more than 11,000 Beijing-area prices of items in five categories: food, electronics and appliances, clothing, real estate and services.\n\"Through meticulous analysis of the collected data, I conclude that retailers in China could have gained as much as an extra 4.16 percent by manipulating price tag numbers to take advantage of superstitions,\" he writes, \"which could translate into as much as 1.40 percent of annual GDP in 2007, where these retailer gains are consumer losses.\"\nEssentially, any time a Chinese retailer changes the price of an item to avoid the number 4, he uses a higher number. The practice leads to higher prices; Yang found that 4 is significantly under-represented and that 8 is significantly over-represented in the final digit of prices.\nPrevious studies in marketing journals have identified this pattern, but haven't addressed the winners and losers it creates. \"The use of superstitious numbers in pricing and the exploitation of superstition in retail sales is more than a cultural phenomenon,\" Yang writes. \"Given its ubiquity, the use of superstitious numbers in prices should not be viewed as a mere marketing gimmick either.\"\nIt's this conclusion that distinguishes Yang's paper, which was highlighted in the January/Febrary edition of Harvard Business Review.\n\"Consumers overpay for what they purchase in China in general,\" he says. \"There's a lot of profit margin, which means there's a lot of room for manipulation.\"\nYang, whose research primarily focuses on energy and environmental economics, tackled the question of lucky numbers on a lark. He may return to this topic for a future project, though: He'd like to examine consumer purchase patterns as they relate to \"lucky\" numbers in China.\nOne Response to \"'Lucky' numbers make for unlucky customers\"\nBob Mtichell says: Feb 21, 2013 at 10:27 pm Spectacular!\nYour thoughtful contribution to the online discussion is appreciated.\nBU mathematicians take numbers to the ninth level  -  and a world record Two Harpur College math professors have taken the concept of a magic square  -  a mathematical challenge where every row...\nNumbers theorist to write two books Binghamton numbers theorist Adrian Vasiu, who studies Shimura varieties, recently received research funding through the federal stimulus....\nEconomist offers a cool model for a hot planet In his recent book, Binghamton University's Zili Yang suggests ways governments might realistically work together to reduce carbon dioxide emissions....\nThe power of suggestion: Psychologist explores ways to make hypnosis a more effective therapeutic technique In the popular imagination, a person who submits to hypnosis falls into a trance.

        "webpage": "McKinney, Foley divided on cutting the state budget\nNeil Vigdor\nPublished 9:34 pm, Saturday, July 19, 2014\nRepublican Tom Foley isn't the first person to be criticized for taking the world view that something should be flat.\nIn this case, it's the trajectory of the $19 billion state budget, which the favorite to challenge Gov. Dannel P. Malloy in a November rematch says he would hold flat for two years if elected. A private equity manager and former diplomat from Greenwich, Foley was jeered at the AFL-CIO's political convention in June and portrayed as an enemy of labor who would look to emulate the union-busting Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker. Pledging to keep the budget flat, rather than address a looming $1.4 billion budget deficit, may be an attempt to mend fences, critics say. \"His advisers are probably saying, `Don't antagonize labor, don't antagonize the cities,' \" said John Olsen, former president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, which endorsed Malloy. \"He's either afraid or unable to show where he would actually reduce spending within the state budget.\"\nThe tack has opened up Foley to criticism from his GOP primary foe, state Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, as well. McKinney, of Fairfield, contends that the only way to address the deficit is to reduce state spending.\nMcKinney, the top Republican in a Legislature dominated by Democrats, favors cutting management and a hiring freeze in what he calls a top-heavy state government. He also supports reopening labor contracts to obtain savings, which he said Foley opposes. \"I think we need to make that part of our state government much more efficient and lean,\" McKinney said. The budget signed by Malloy increased spending by 2.5 percent, according to the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis, a calculation that Republicans dispute because they say it doesn't take into account an additional $2.5 billion in Medicaid spending. Budget analysts stood by the figure, saying that Connecticut is reimbursed 100 percent for Medicaid by the federal government under the Affordable Care Act.\nBy keeping the spending unchanged, Foley said the projected $1.4 billion deficit would be wiped out, a position he says is supported by independent budget models. \"The idea that John McKinney is going to do better at getting control of spending better than I will is ridiculous,\" Foley said. \"John McKinney has never run anything. He has no executive experience.\"\nForecasts show that Foley would have his work cut out for him to maintain the current budget level, however. The state is staring at a $345 million increase in debt service payments in the 2016 fiscal year that will be unavoidable, according to OFA. Connecticut's pension obligations are also on the rise, with the state facing a $44 billion gap for its two major funds for public sector employees and teachers. Foley said state agencies would be forced to make do with less if he is governor and break the habit of requesting yearly budgetary increases of 7 percent or higher to maintain current service levels.\n\"It's kind of a wish list for them,\" Foley said. \"They throw as big a number up there as they can. They don't need it. Nobody's putting pressure on them to get productivity improvement.\" Malloy's surrogates say the projected deficit of $1.4 billion assumes a 7 percent spending increase, which is substantially higher than any of the final budgets put forward by the governor during his first term. They questioned Foley's math. \"Tom Foley has campaigned on reckless, impossible-to-keep promises on the budget, which would mean he would have to cut funding for our schools, pull the plug on health care, slash support for cities and towns -- driving up property taxes -- and lay off droves of employees,\" said Devon Puglia, a state Democratic Party spokesman. The current budget sets aside $70 million in municipal aid and $50 million in Educational Cost Sharing grants, levels that Foley said he would maintain or, in the case of education, increase. Foley said he would prioritize reducing the expense associated with providing health care to state employees and retirees, a major cost for the state.\nMcKinney called Foley's cost-saving plan \"hollow.\"\n\"He's taken employee and retiree health care costs completely off the table because he says he won't open the existing contracts,\" McKinney said. ; 203-625-4436;"

According to the report, more than half of American consumers use tax preparers every year.\nThe report, Riddled Returns, How errors and fraud by paid tax preparers put consumers at risk and what states can do, cites these examples of \"incompetency and outright fraud\":\nIntentional omission of income\nFalsifying information to make the taxpayer eligible for various credits and deductions, such as charitable deductions, job-related or business expenses or the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)\nInability to properly deal with education-related credits and income\nMisclassifying filing status\nData-entry errors resulting in incorrect refunds\nConsumer and advocacy groups and government agencies conducted 127 tests of tax preparers from 2008 through 2012 and found instances of serious errors and fraud 72 of the cases.\nFor a consumer, an incorrectly prepared tax return can trigger serious economic problems or even criminal sanctions.\nIncorrect tax filings can be especially damaging to low-income families, for whom a tax return can be the single largest amount of money they will receive in a year. In Colorado, 1.04 million residents used tax preparers in the 2102 filing season. Of these, 176,822 filers had income low enough to qualify for the federal Earned Income Tax Credit.\nThe report is based on data collected using mystery-shopper tests conducted in small and large states and rural and urban areas. The mystery shopper test is a method used to measure the quality of service or compliance with regulation. The tests were conducted by consumer and advocacy groups, as well as the NCLC, U.S. Treasury's Inspector General for Tax Administration, Government Accountability Office and First Nations Development Institute.\nNCLC argues that there is lack of minimum standards for education, training or competency for the tax preparers.\n\"In 47 states, there are more regulatory requirements for hairdressers than tax preparers,\" the report states.\nBecause of the significant percentage of fraud and incompetence found during the tests, NCLC determined that the problem needs urgent regulation to protect both taxpayers and public treasuries. The Internal Revenue Service has made attempts to regulate tax preparers, but these attempts were blocked by a federal court in 2013. The NCLC suggests that it is therefore up to Congress or the states to institute preparer regulations.\nIt recommends registration of all tax preparers, standardized disclosure of preparation fees and a basic competency exam with 60 hours of initial education and 15 hours per year of continuing education. Along with the report, NCLC provides a Model Individual Tax Preparer Act with specific language that states can use to implement the recommendations. The act is based on state laws of the three states that regulate tax preparers (Maryland, Oregon and California), as well as the IRS regulations.\n- George Awuor\nArticle posted on December 13, 2013 Printer-friendly version\nBell Events\nGateways to Opportunity\nHealthy Birth\nDiploma and Skills\nAdult Training & Education\nHealthy Adult Life\nEarn a Living"

        "webpage": "Janet Yellen Approved for Fed by Senate Committee Subscribe Free\nBy Brian Powell \u00b7 November 21, 2013 \u00b7 Comments Off Get the WebProNews Newsletter: [ Life]\nThursday morning, the Senate Banking Committee approved Janet Yellen's nomination to become the next Chair of the Federal Reserve by a 14 to 8 vote. This vote comes as no surprise to political pundits, especially seeing as Democrats hold 12 of the 22 seats on the committee and Yellen has been supported by Democrats and Republicans, alike, before the vote took place. In early October, Barack Obama announced Janet Yellen as his nomination to replace Ben Bernanke as Chair of the Federal Reserve when his term ends on January 31, 2014, and for good reason. Currently, Yellen holds the position as vice-chair of the Federal Reserve. Before her current role, Yellen had served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and as an economic adviser during the Clinton administration. Not only does Yellen have the pedigree to make her an appropriate candidate for the next chair of the Fed, but over 350 economists sent a letter to President Obama earlier this year voicing their approval of Yellen as the next nominee for Fed chair. Despite her credentials, however, many Republicans had voiced their opposition to her nomination. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, has expressed his doubts that Yellen has the right monetary policy to lead the Fed during the current US financial situation: \"She has championed policies that have diminished people's purchasing power by weakening the dollar, made long-term savings less attractive by diminishing returns on this important behavior, and put the US economy at increased risk of higher inflation and another future boom-bust.\" Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, the ranking Republican on the Senate banking committee, also voiced concern about Yellen's continued support of the US bond-buying program: \"The long-term costs of these policies are unclear and, frankly, worrisome. The immediate benefits are questionable and markets have become too reliant on monetary stimulus.\"\nWhile most Republicans have apprehensions and disagreements with how the Federal Reserve is handling the financial situation of the US, Yellen is most likely going to win nomination while continuing the same policies as her predecessor, Ben Bernanke. Yellen is described as a \"dove\", meaning that during times of financial crisis, she will bolster Fed policies that fight against unemployment and attempt to drive spending. Conversely, Republicans would like to see a Fed chair who was a \"hawk\", one who would focus more on suppressing inflation than worrying about unemployment. The biggest concern of Republicans, however, deals with the Fed's bond-buying program. As it currently stands, the Federal Reserve purchases $85 billion of government bonds per month in an effort to drive down interest rates and encourage loans and investments. Republicans, as Senator Crapo expressed in the statement above, are worried that these investments are artificially driving-up the price of stocks and will soon result in a bubble-burst similar to the 2008 financial crisis.\nDemocrats, and some Republicans (such as Bob Corker of Tennessee, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma - who voted for Yellen's nomination on the Senate banking committee, and Susan Collins of Maine, Orrin Hatch of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska - who have voiced that they will support Yellen's nomination), point toward Yellen's proven track record of intellect and success as the reasons as to why there should be no issues concerning her nomination: \"She has devoted a large portion of her professional and academic career to studying the labor market, unemployment, monetary policy, and the economy. As we saw in her testimony last week, Dr. Yellen understands the challenges facing our economy and the balance the Fed must strike as we navigate the path back to full employment,\" stated Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson (D-S.D.).\nDue to her current role as vice-chair of the Federal Reserve and bipartisan support, Yellen should receive the 60 votes necessary to secure her position as the next Chair of the Fed (especially if Harry Reid is successful in changing the rules to make 51 votes the number required to secure nomination). If she is successful, Yellen will become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve since its inception over 100 years ago, a move which would be another huge step toward incorporating more women within politics in Washington, DC.

        "webpage": "Dependency, not poverty, is the problem\nWalter Williams, Creators Syndicate\nThere is no material poverty in the U.S. Here are a few facts about people whom the Census Bureau labels as poor. Dr. Robert Rector and Rachel Sheffield, in their study \"Understanding Poverty in the United States: Surprising Facts About America's Poor\", report that 80 percent of poor households have air conditioning; nearly three-quarters have a car or truck, and 31 percent have two or more. Two-thirds have cable or satellite TV. Half have one or more computers. Forty-two percent own their homes. Poor Americans have more living space than the typical non-poor person in Sweden, France or the U.K. What we have in our nation are dependency and poverty of the spirit, with people making unwise choices and leading pathological lives aided and abetted by the welfare state.\nThe Census Bureau pegs the poverty rate among blacks at 35 percent and among whites at 13 percent. The illegitimacy rate among blacks is 72 percent, and among whites it's 30 percent. A statistic that one doesn't hear much about is that the poverty rate among black married families has been in the single digits for more than two decades, currently at 8 percent. For married white families, it's 5 percent. Now the politically incorrect questions: Whose fault is it to have children without the benefit of marriage and risk a life of dependency? Do people have free will, or are they governed by instincts?\nThere may be some pinhead sociologists who blame the weak black family structure on racial discrimination. But why was the black illegitimacy rate only 14 percent in 1940, and why, as Dr. Thomas Sowell reports, do we find that census data \"going back a hundred years, when blacks were just one generation out of slavery ... showed that a slightly higher percentage of black adults had married than white adults. This fact remained true in every census from 1890 to 1940\"? Is anyone willing to advance the argument that the reason the illegitimacy rate among blacks was lower and marriage rates higher in earlier periods was there was less racial discrimination and greater opportunity?\nNo one can blame a person if he starts out in life poor, because how one starts out is not his fault. If he stays poor, he is to blame because it is his fault. Avoiding long-term poverty is not rocket science. First, graduate from high school. Second, get married before you have children, and stay married. Third, work at any kind of job, even one that starts out paying the minimum wage. And finally, avoid engaging in criminal behavior. It turns out that a married couple, each earning the minimum wage, would earn an annual combined income of $30,000. The Census Bureau poverty line for a family of two is $15,500, and for a family of four, it's $23,000. By the way, no adult who starts out earning the minimum wage does so for very long.\nSince President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty, the nation has spent about $18 trillion at the federal, state and local levels of government on programs justified by the \"need\" to deal with some aspect of poverty. In a column of mine in 1995, I pointed out that at that time, the nation had spent $5.4 trillion on the War on Poverty, and with that princely sum, \"you could purchase every U.S. factory, all manufacturing equipment, and every office building. With what's left over, one could buy every airline, trucking company and our commercial maritime fleet. If you're still in the shopping mood, you could also buy every television, radio and power company, plus every retail and wholesale store in the entire nation\". Today's total of $18 trillion spent on poverty means you could purchase everything produced in our country each year and then some.\nThere's very little guts in the political arena to address the basic causes of poverty. To do so risks being labeled as racist, sexist, uncaring and insensitive. That means today's dependency is likely to become permanent.\nWalter E. Williams is a professor of economics at George Mason University.\nFull bio and more articles by Walter Williams"

The federal government spent an extra $1.3 billion to borrow last year because of the showdown over the debt ceiling, the Government Accountability Office reported Monday. Print\nCommentRepublicans in Congress and the Obama administration were locked in battle for months over how to raise the country's legal borrowing limit. \"Delays in raising the debt limit can create uncertainty in the Treasury market and lead to higher Treasury borrowing costs,\" the GAO said.Indeed, even though bond rates were low last year, the GAO found that the Treasury Department paid a premium on many government securities in the eight months leading up to the eventual deal in August.Related: Debt ceiling in play againThe premium reflected the relative risk of government securities to private-sector debt. Rates on private-sector debt are typically higher than those on government bonds. But the difference between the two narrowed in 2011.In other words, investors demanded the government pay higher rates than it would have on federal debt with due dates of two years or more.The GAO, the country's official auditor, also noted that the longer term costs of the 2011 debt limit fight will be higher, since the interest costs that Treasury locked in during the first eight months of the year will be paid out over time.There were intangible costs as well amidst the months of uncertainty that preceded lawmakers' deal to raise the debt ceiling and the subsequent downgrade of the country's credit rating by Standard & Poor's.\"[M]anaging federal debt ... was complex, time-consuming, and technically challenging,\" the GAO said. Congress, of course, will eventually have to raise the debt ceiling again. Exactly when is unclear.The legal borrowing limit is currently $16.394 trillion. Related: Biggest threat to global economy: PoliticsAs of last Thursday, the country's accrued debt stood $559 billion below that limit. If the government continues to run monthly deficits between $100 billion and $125 billion, the debt load may approach the ceiling as early as mid-November.But Treasury can buy some time with so-called extraordinary measures such as suspending contributions to federal pension plans. Has Congress learned its lesson about the risks of political brinksmanship? Apparently not.0:00\n/1:27Boehner's 'line in the sand' on debtFor starters,House Speaker John Boehner in May issued the same ultimatum on the debt ceiling that he issued in 2011. He said any debt ceiling increase must be accompanied by an even larger amount of spending cuts.Since then, both parties have engaged in a battle over the so-called fiscal cliff -- a series of large, overnight tax increases and spending cuts. Combined they would hurt the economy in the short-run if Congress does nothing to replace them with more gradual deficit-reduction strategies.Just what lawmakers will do about the cliff -- and when -- is unclear. And that uncertainty is already thought to be hurting the economy through a slowdown in hiring and a reluctance among businesses to invest. First Published: July 23, 2012: 3:21 PM ET Most Popular"

European finance ministers met all night Monday without reaching agreement on whether to release the next round of emergency aid to Greece, where unemployment is around 25 percent.Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, who convened the summit meeting and called off the negotiations rather than prolonging them through the weekend, said that the European Union's budget \"has to be balanced and well prepared, not in the mood of improvisation, because we are touching upon jobs, we are touching upon sensitive issues.\"\"We should be able to bridge existing divergences\" in the new year, Van Rompuy said.Much of the attention at the meeting focused on Cameron, who rallied a group of other countries in favor of deep cuts to the Multiannual Financial Framework, a seven-year spending plan.Disagreements over where the ax should fall left France and Germany on different sides, disrupting a Franco-German tandem without which significant deals in Europe rarely happen.France defended payments to farmers, who make up around 40 percent of the current budget, but insisted there was no rupture with Germany.\"I don't only defend the position of France, but the position of Europe as a whole,\" President Francois Hollande said at a news conference.The negotiating marathon over the budget is held every seven years. The focus on hard cash tends to push national interests to the fore and swamp talk of European harmony, a cause for which the Norwegian Nobel Committee last month named the European Union as the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.The budget, which amounts to about $168 billion per year, goes mostly to subsidize farmers and support regional projects in poorer member states, policies that were originally intended to help bind Europe together and mute the economic discord that in the past fueled antagonisms that led to bloody wars.But differences in economic performance and in priorities between member states are huge, pushing them to embrace starkly divergent agendas in budget talks.In large measure, this is because what began as an economic bloc comprising six similarly developed market economies in Western Europe is now a 27-member body that includes 10 much poorer Eastern and Central European nations that were part of the socialist bloc.As well as divisions between east and west, there is also a big gulf between northern countries, especially Germany, and so-called Club Med states in the south like Greece, which, burdened with huge debts, is struggling to keep its economy afloat and avoid social unrest.\"There are still important differences on a number of key issues, especially the overall size of the budget and the fairness of distributions between member states,\" Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, told reporters as the summit meeting broke up Friday afternoon."

        "webpage": "Ohio's Flat Job Growth Limits Opportunity For High-Paying Jobs By Tom Borgerding\nAug 18, 2014 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services found Ohio's unemployment rate went up in July. Credit WOSU State and national jobless numbers are closely watched as economic indicators, and the unemployment figures can also give useful clues for those seeking their first full-time job. Listen Listening... / 2:54 Last month, 323,000 Ohio adults were actively seeking work and not able to find a job, and the unemployment rate crept up for the first time in several months. The figure includes recent high school and college graduates looking for that first job, or an entry level job. \"First of all, the availability of jobs is not terribly encouraging,\" says Randy Olsen, an Ohio State University economist. He says Ohio and the U.S. are experiencing what he calls a \"mild\" recovery from the Great Recession. But the labor force, those working or looking for work, remains smaller now than in 2007. Olsen adds current economic growth is too tepid to make employers hire more aggressively. \"One percent rate of growth in the economy or something close to that is not a growth rate that's going to make a huge dent in the labor market,\" says Olsen. He says that slow growth restrains hiring and keeps wages from rising too fast. At the Department of Job and Family Services, spokesman Ben Johnson says 186,000 jobs are currently posted on the agency's website. But, he says about a third of those jobs pay $30,000 dollars or less and, in most cases, a high school education is all that's needed to apply. \"About 54.9 percent of all the jobs posted statewide required only a G.E.D. or a high school diploma and about 49.7 percent of the jobs posted in the Columbus region required only a G.E.D. or high school diploma,\" says Johnson. Johnson adds that many of those available jobs are service-sector occupations. \"Truck drivers are one of the top three or five, retail salesperson is one of the top three of five. Front line retail supervisor is one of the top three of five. Retail, retail supervising and truck drivers in many cases probably only require a G.E.D. or a high school diploma,\" Johnson says. Olsen views Ohio's job market as instructive. While more jobs are being listed on job boards and classifieds in recent months, openings skew toward lower paying positions that require only a high school diploma. It's harder for recent college graduates to launch a career. \"A lot of the jobs that have sprung up have been in less well-paying occupations. The good jobs that I think new undergraduates would like to secure, the opportunities aren't there like they were ten or more years ago,\" says Olsen. Olsen says until the economy accelerates faster, first-time job opportunities with higher wages will remain elusive.

        "webpage": "National Flood Insurance Program Working on Affordability\nBy Arthur D. Postal\nMarch 29, 2013 \u2022 Reprints National Flood Insurance Program customers who want to pay on an installment basis will have a while to wait because the agency will have to go through a notice-and-comment process before creating them.\nMoreover, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has started work on studies about program affordability, privatization and reinsurance, three of the 16 studies it is mandated to undertake under the July 2012 legislation intended to provide long-term certainty for the NFIP.\n\"Those are the studies we think are priorities,\" said Edward Connor, deputy associate administrator for the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration, the FEMA sub-agency that manages the NFIP.\nConnor discussed the installment plan and studies issues on Friday as part of a wide-ranging briefing on the Biggert-Waters Act, the law that extended the program for five years.\nDuring the conference call, Connor cautioned that new actuarial rates mandated by the program will not pay off its debt, which increased 50%, to $30.4 billion, as a result of action Jan. 8 by Congress, just six months after the law was enacted.\nConnor estimated that only 1.1 million of the 5.5 million homes in the program will be affected by the phase-out of subsidized rates over four years mandated by the new law.\nConnor cautioned that the new rates will not provide enough money to pay off the program's debt, but it will provide greater stability to the program.\nIndeed, it remains unclear how much new revenue will be created by the new limits on subsidized rates; \"how that works out remains unclear,\" he said.\nThe debt limit was raised in order to pay the cost of settling claims resulting from Superstorm Sandy after it hit the Northeast in late October.\nThe primary purpose of the conference call was to brief the press on the rate hikes imposed by the law.\nThis includes a mandate to eliminate subsidies on second homes and rental properties through a four-year phase-in process. The new law also mandated phase-in of full rates for properties that have suffered multiple losses, Connor said.\nConnor also said that people on subsidized rates who drop out of the program because they don't want to pay the higher rates will be forced to pay the actuarial rate if they decide to rejoin the NFIP in the future.\nConnor deflected responsibility for the higher rates when responding to a comment by a reporter from a Gulf Coast-area media outlet, who contended that people in that area believe the agency is raising rates to people with so-called \"serial claims\" because it wants to force them out of their communities.\nHis response was that, \"all these changes were mandated by Congress, not the agency.\"\nConnor acknowledged that the impact of the new rates will mostly be felt by moderate- and lower-income homeowners. These include higher premiums for those in areas hit by Sandy who will be required to elevate their properties in order to retain their existing rates.\nBut, Connor said, dropping out of the program won't work because flood insurance in areas prone to flooding is required for those who have federally insured mortgages.\nIf you have a mortgage that is federally insured, and you drop your policy, the mortgage holder will force a policy on you that has a rate equal or higher than those charged by the NFIP,\" the FEMA official said.\nFor those who own their homes and decide to drop their flood insurance, Connor said, depending on payments from the government post-flood is not such a good idea.\n\"Payments for those without flood insurance with a home worth $150,000 to $200,000 post-flood won't work,\" he said, \"because the payments are unlikely to exceed $3,000.\"\nHe acknowledged that higher rates floor flood insurance imposed by the new law is a \"tough deal,\" especially for those on the lower end of the income scale.\nHe said that, ideally, rates would be much lower if there was \"total penetration,\" that is, everyone in a flood zone had flood insurance, or, even more ideally, if everyone with a home is required to have flood insurance.\"\n\"Rates would be more affordable if everyone participates,\" he said, but that is unlikely.\nAs to commissions for agents, he said payments to write-your-own companies for their expenses presume a 15% commission for agents.\nConnor said the \"size and complexity of the rate changes imposed by the law are too complex to be covered in renewal brochures, but will be available on agency websites. He also noted that agents will be helpful in telling homeowners ways they can \"buy-down\" their rates, for example, by elevating homes to mandated levels in flood-prone areas.\nHe also suggested that agents can suggest higher deductibles for those who need lower rates.\nHe also discussed the \"community rating system\" used by 1,200 communities to get the rates reduced for those who live within them by following mitigation programs sanctioned by the agency.\n\"Mitigation efforts can reduce rates,\" the FEMA official said.

        "webpage": "How Some Successful People Start Their Day\n\nWhether it's rising with the sun to get a jump on the day or hitting the snooze button as many times as possible, we all have different morning routines. Nobody can tell you the perfect way to structure your morning, but if you're hoping to reinvigorate yourself or your business, start by taking a hard look at how you begin the day.\n\nAnd if you're looking for inspiration, many of the industry's top performers and the world's most successful people follow a similar set of morning rituals. From getting up early to setting goals, here are five things many of the world's most successful people do before getting to work.\n\nUp and at 'em\n\nThe easiest way to make your mornings more meaningful is to make them longer, and there's only one way to do that  -  get up earlier.\n\nLaura Vanderkam, author of \"What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast\", said 90% of executives wake up before 6 a.m. on weekdays. Many of the world's most successful people get up even earlier.\n\nIn addition to giving you the time needed to complete the rest of your morning routine, getting up with the sun gives you the necessary quiet time to gather your thoughts and prepare for the day. And especially for brokers leading busy lives, starting early helps you gain control of your business by granting you the time to plan your day.\n\nSet goals\n\nTop performing brokers set goals, and most do so in the quiet of the morning. Setting goals gives you clear objectives to work towards, and that clarity hones your focus and helps guide you to the finish line.\n\nIn addition to setting weekly goals, it's helpful to break down larger goals into smaller steps. To be more precise, set daily goals that will bring you closer to achieving larger aspirations. While it's important to update your checklist as the day progresses, begin your day with focus and set clear goals every morning.\n\nKeep a journal\n\nOur memory isn't usually as good as we think it is. That's why it's important to actually write goals down, not just keep them in our heads. It's also why many top brokers keep some type of journal handy.\n\nIt could be a physical journal, an app on your phone or even, in cases of emergency, a post-it note. Whatever it is, use a journal to write down important ideas that come to you. And since our willpower tends to be highest in the morning, keep a journal on hand to write down new strategies you come up during the course of your morning routine.\n\nPut down the phone\n\nUnlike many other professionals, brokers are surrounded by uncertainty. While it's tempting to reach for your phone first thing in morning to see if your latest prospecting efforts paid off, a bit of time off the grid can do wonders.\n\nStudies show being glued to your smartphone hurts your sleep and can even make it harder to think. So while you certainly need your phone during the day, embrace the time in the morning to just think in peace and quiet. Not only is a bit of daily silence restorative, but disconnecting from your phone in the morning makes it easier to focus on the rest of your morning routine.\n\nExercise\n\nIt's no secret exercise keeps you healthy, gives you more energy, and reduces stress. With benefits like that, it's no wonder many of the world's most successful people love to work out.\n\nBut when the day gets busy, we tend to have a way of postponing exercise  -  often indefinitely. To ensure they actually get their workout in, many highly successful people exercise first thing in the morning. It's a great way to wake up, prepare for the day and accomplish something important before even getting to the office.\n\nIn addition to exercise, a huge percentage of top performers meditate. From brokers to surfers, Tim Ferriss interviewed 140 people at the pinnacle of their fields and found that about 90% practice some type of meditation. Ferriss said most of the people he spoke with meditate for 20 minutes every morning.\n\nAs American historian Will Durant famously summed up Aristotle: \"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.\"\n\nSo whether you're looking to supercharge your business or rekindle your motivation, start by examining your morning routine. What you do when you wake up sets the tone for the rest of the day, and from working out to setting goals, learn from the world's top performers and kick your day off right.\n\nAbout The Sundance Company\nEstablished in 1976, The Sundance Company has the experience to help you with your commercial real estate needs throughout the Boise Valley.

The mere mention of this rocky island outpost used to send chills down the spine of over-leveraged nations worldwide. No more. What was once the poster child for economic excess has emerged a role model for countries struggling to save their bacon in the global bond market. Fitch Ratings on Friday raised its credit rating on Iceland to BBB- from BB+. The move marks the passage of Iceland's debt from junk back to investment grade. At the same time, Fitch declared Iceland's economic outlook stable, something that might have seemed unattainable three years ago. Iceland was the proverbial canary in the mine shaft, a tiny nation (population 313,000) of fishermen and sheepherders that had this crazy notion it could transform itself into a major hub of international finance. Reuters\nSmoke rises from the Grimsvotn volcano, under the Vatnajokull glacier in southeast Iceland May 21, 2011. After Iceland's most active volcano erupted, a thick cloud of ash blocked out the daylight at towns and villages at the foot of the glacier where the volcano lies and covered cars and buildings. It worked, for a while, thanks to easy credit, lax oversight of its banks, clueless credit ratings and a collective abandonment of fundamental economic realities. Sound familiar? As the money flowed, Icelanders came to believe that maybe, just maybe, they could afford to live like London bankers. Soon they were convinced they could. And while the nation's sparse gravel roads gave way to paved freeways ferrying a bunch of brand-new Land Rovers, old-timers wondered whether their young financial gurus were leading the nation into the dream realm of the Mountain King. Then they got their clocks cleaned. When global credit markets unraveled in 2008, Iceland's three biggest commercial banks collapsed. Iceland's debt rating plummeted to junk status. The value of its currency, the krona , fell sharply and a severe economic recession set in. But it's a testament to the Icelanders that they quickly recognized they'd built a house of cards and took drastic action to recover that involved, among other things, nationalizing one bank and handing control of all three major banks to the equivalent of a board of creditors. The tough lessons of the past decade's excesses galvanized Icelanders. They got to work slashing public spending to bring it closer in line with their GDP, salvaged their tattered currency and, last summer, successfully exited a rescue program set up by the International Monetary Fund. Consequently, Iceland once again has access to international credit markets. Land Rover sales are no doubt down and Reykjavik's red-hot night life has probably cooled a bit. But there were never riots in the streets and they never blamed their neighbors for their predicament. The fact that Icelanders don't have neighbors might actually be key to their turnaround effort. After spending most of the past 1,000 years isolated from the rest of the world, the need for self-reliance and understanding that actions have consequences are nothing new to them. That's probably a timely, and inspiring, lesson for the rest of us.  -  Jim Jelter"

Read More\nBy Inmaculada Bel-Oms and Mar\u00eda Consuelo Pucheta-Mart\u00ednez August 13th 2014 Is there gender gap in pay on the boards of listed Spanish firms? If there is, what are the factors behind the gender gap in pay? We sought to find out the answers to these questions.\nOver the last few decades, payments for men have been consistently higher than those for women, even when they hold the same post and have been educated to the same level. This has created a gender gap in pay. Several studies have analysed the existence of such gender gaps in pay in national and international contexts and have shown that this gender gap in pay was caused by occupational segregation and various other factors that can be explained by human capital theory. Occupational segregation meant that women were being excluded from certain kinds of work, and tended to be concentrated in occupations with low salaries (Bayard et al., 1999; De la Rica, 2007). On the other hand, the human capital approach is focused on individuals investing themselves; i.e. adopting certain strategies to increase their own knowledge, experience and skills over the years (Amarante and Espino, 2002; Varela et al., 2010).\nSpanish society was traditionally characterized by a strong ideology based on the idea that women should be dedicated to family life, which explained the low numbers of women in the labour market. However, between the 1970s and the 1990s, many changes in legislation governing the treatment of men and women were introduced. There has long been a general belief that one of the fundamental characteristics of the Spanish labour market was, and is, the persistent and strong wage gender discrimination in similar jobs: men are clearly paid more than women. To solve this problem, organisms and regulators have developed a set of standards and regulations to guarantee that women are employed under equal conditions to men and to prevent male-female director's compensation discrimination. Among these regulations, Article 14 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, the Workers' Statute Act of 1980, the 3rd Plan for Equal Opportunities for Men and Women (1997-2000) and the Act 3/2007 for Equality Law have all been produced.\nWe posit that the percentage of female directors on boards, the presence of female directors on Nomination and Compensation Committees, the presence of well-qualified independent female directors on boards of directors (BDs), the firm sector and the geographical region have an effect on the gender wage gap. When we observe the variable presence of women on the Nomination and Compensation Committee, we find that there is a gender gap in pay in Spanish listing firms. However, the presence of well-qualified independent women directors on BDs reduces the gender gap in pay. A similar pattern occurs with the firm sector since the male-female compensation difference between directors is smaller in the boards of financial services and property sector firms. The remainder of variables analysed have no effect on the gender gap in pay.\nThis has special relevance in a country like Spain because the previous literature is based on that of English-speaking nations, as well as certain Eastern European and Asian countries. Moreover, previous empirical findings on the gender gap in pay use data from the European Structure of Earnings Survey (ESES).\nOur results provide evidence that there is gender gap in pay in Spanish BDs. This study should encourage regulators and politicians to strive to bring about changes in legislation in order to reduce or eliminate the gender gap in pay. Moreover, they need to provide effective and strong sanctions for non-compliance with laws.\nImage credit: Madrid, Cuatro Torres Business Area, by Hakan Svensson.

        "webpage": "Obama decides not to extend term of jobs council\nBy JOSH LEDERMANAssociated Press\nGeneral Electric Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt listens at right as President Barack Obama meets with the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. WASHINGTON, D.C.  -  President Barack Obama is letting his jobs council expire, cutting off one source of input from business leaders while unemployment remains stubbornly high.\nObama formed the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in January 2011, when unemployment was about 9 percent. It's now 7.8 percent, though more than 12 million people are out of work.\nObama's executive order establishing the council said it would go out of business Jan. 31, 2013. The White House said Thursday that Obama had no plans to renew its charter.\n\"The work of the jobs council was very valuable,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \"While the president didn't agree with all of its recommendations, he agreed with many of them and acted on a number of them.\"\nWhite House officials said Obama intended for the council to fulfill its mission and then wind down, and that he would seek input about the economy from business leaders in other ways. Among the steps Obama plans to pursue are expedited permits for public works projects, plus programs to boost entrepreneurship and workforce development.\nEven before Obama's decision was clear, Republicans seized on the council's likely expiration as evidence the president hadn't spent enough time on trying to create jobs, which is a priority for Americans. The Republican National Committee called it part of \"the failed Obama record,\" while the House Republicans' campaign committee, in an online petition, accused Obama of laying off his own jobs council.\nAdding to the concern about the job market's vulnerability, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December of last year, the first quarterly drop since 2009. The Federal Reserve said the economy appears to have \"paused in recent months.\"\nThe jobs council was a successor to an economic advisory board Obama created at the onset of his presidency. The panel was chaired by General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt and included prominent business leaders and economists. Immelt said Thursday that progress has been made on putting in place 90 percent of the council's recommendations.\nObama met with the council only a few times. During the last meeting, in February 2012, the president and the council highlighted an engineering education initiative alongside school deans.\n\"The president treated his jobs council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nThe council's main product was a report, \"Roadmap to Renewal,\" that was released in January 2012. The council also organized a series of meetings across the country last year with business owners, elected officials and academics; Obama didn't attend those election-year sessions.\nCritics have argued that the council's primary purpose was to create the appearance of action at a time when the nation was pining for something to rein in soaring joblessness. The administration acted on many of the council's recommendations, including suggestions to streamline permitting and small business loans, increase tourist visas and boost energy efficiency.\nBut the White House was at odds with several council members on tax policies, particularly a proposal to exclude overseas corporate earnings from U.S. taxes. That idea divided even the jobs council, whose membership included labor and Obama's political allies.\n\"It was helpful in terms of putting a spotlight on a variety of issues, but particularly helpful in the area of entrepreneurship,\" said AOL co-founder Steve Case, a member of the panel, in an interview. \"There's still work to be done, but we did make good progress.\"\nThe council's dissolution also comes as White House aides are optimistic about the prospects for a second-term detente with business.\nDuring Obama's first term, business leaders bristled at his harsh depiction of \"fat-cat bankers\" and his efforts to impose regulations, tax policies and spending initiatives they argued were unfriendly to business. Obama aides hope the warming of ties between the president and the business world can benefit the White House in future fiscal debates with Republicans.\nWhite House officials said the president made a fresh effort to reach out to business in the days following his re-election. Between the November election and the end of 2012, in the height of negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff,\" more than 400 business leaders, ranging from CEOs of large multinational companies to small business owners, met with Obama or his aides at the White House, officials said."

        "webpage": "Iran's Ahmadinejad Could Become Scapegoat For Sanction Woes By Scott Neuman\nOct 3, 2012 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during a news conference in Tehran on Tuesday.\nAtta Kenare\nOriginally published on October 21, 2012 8:41 pm Economic sanctions have a reputation for being the international equivalent of a slap on the wrist. But in Iran, there's evidence that they are working, and that the country's flamboyant President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad might pay the price. In the past year, Iran's currency has shed 80 percent of its value against the dollar, dropping by 25 percent in just the past week. That's caused a scramble for the few U.S. dollars available in the black market as people seek a safe haven against the free-falling rial. According to Al-Jazeera, Iranian police have clashed with protesters angered over the massive inflation that threatens to wipe out their savings. Ahmadinejad blames currency speculators. He also readily acknowledges that the international sanctions imposed by the United States, Europe and other countries are taking a toll, even as he remains defiant about giving up the country's nuclear program, which most experts believe is aimed at acquiring an atomic bomb. It has \"put the squeeze\" on Iran's economy, says Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Iranians are feeling the pinch because oil is far and away the country's main export, and much of what ordinary consumers want and need has to be imported. The sanctions have \"basically cut off bank transactions between Iran and all of these other countries,\" Hufbauer says. \"If you don't have bank transactions, how do you pay for anything even if you have money? And money is quickly running out in Iran because of oil sanctions.\" The restrictions have also made it nearly impossible to insure tankers carrying Iranian oil to anyone who is still willing to buy it. \"Each one of these vessels has between $50 [million] and $100 million worth of oil in it,\" he says. \"What kind of shipping company is going to take cargo of that value without insurance?\" Hufbauer thinks the economic sanctions may make it more difficult for Iran to attract the science and engineering talent it needs to get a nuclear bomb past the end zone. Combined with covert operations such as the Stuxnet computer virus and the assassination of one of Iran's nuclear scientists, it could \"set the program back a few years.\" Suzanne Maloney, of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, says what's occurred is \"a kind of feeding frenzy on the streets of ordinary Iranians who simply want to ensure that the value of their money isn't lost overnight.\" Maloney says the sanctions have helped trigger the current situation, but the crisis is \"not tied so much to the specific American, European or international sanctions, so much as it is a growing sense of panic and fear among the Iranian population.\" The Iranian government, she says, has moved to restrict the supply of dollars offered at a preferential exchange rate to particular groups. \"In the past, individuals going on pilgrimage or students going abroad had been able to have access to larger amounts of cheap dollars. Those supplies are beginning to be cut off,\" she says, adding that the current level of inflation is \"unprecedented since the [1979] revolution.\" What are the consequences of the unrest for the Iranian regime? Ahmadinejad's term as president expires next August, and he can't run for re-election. But the president plays second fiddle to the country's real power base, the Islamic clerics. They have grown increasingly disenchanted with his leadership over the past 18 months and may be looking for a convenient scapegoat, Maloney says. \"I wouldn't be surprised if there was an attempt to blame Ahmadinejad,\" she says. \"That seems to be where much of the leadership has been trying to divert attention.\" There's already intense speculation about who succeeds Ahmadinejad. Whoever the new president is, he is unlikely to abandon the nuclear program outright. \"We will see the Iranians dangle a bit more receptivity and flexibility on the negotiating front,\" Maloney says. \"I don't think they've made the strategic decision to capitulate on all of the demands of the international community or Washington, but I do think they recognize they are going to have to play in order to get paid.\"Copyright 2013 NPR.

        "webpage": "> Dispute Resolution\n> Bank Appeals\n> Summaries Dispute Resolution Home Consumer Complaints\nBank Appeals Summaries\nAppeal of Accounting Decision (Fourth Quarter 2002) A bank appealed two OCC decisions regarding the accounting treatment for income earned and expenses incurred from two separate affinity card relationships. The issues involved the bank's contractual agreements with an affinity group (contract no. 1) and an affiliate (contract no. 2), respectively, and are individually discussed below.Contract No. 1BackgroundThe bank purchased an existing affinity portfolio from another institution at a premium. The contract with the affinity association required an advance at signing and minimum annual payments (royalty expense). The bank computed the expenses associated with the contract based on a formula that allocated most of the expense to the latter years of the contract because of the belief that the economics of the program would improve over time. The bank recorded the difference between the minimum payments and the formula expense as a prepaid asset.DiscussionThe OCC and the bank agreed that the guiding standards fell under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts (No. 5), which requires that expenses be allocated in a systematic and rational manner during the period in which the related assets are expected to provide benefits.In determining the criteria of systematic and rational, the bank considered the totality of the agreement with the recognition of royalty expenses, which include the amortization of the purchase premium. The premium for the portfolio reflected the benefit in prior years of the affinity group's endorsements compared to the benefits enjoyed from royalty payments in later years. The bank believed that the combination of royalty expense and premium amortization resulted in a reasonably consistent charge against receivables. Escalation of royalty fees paid to the affinity group mirrored the improving economics of the program over time. The bank's external auditors agreed that the bank's approach was systematic and rational.The OCC concluded that a systematic and rational approach was one that recognized periodic expense in relationship to the average revolving receivable balances in the corresponding period. Based on the bank's projections, the OCC determined that an amortization rate of between 1.1 and 1.3 percent of average revolving balances would provide this level relationship. The OCC estimated that such a method would reduce the prepaid balance by almost 75 percent and directed the bank to charge off this amount.ConclusionThe accounting standards and principles relevant to this transaction are not specific. Therefore, when considering the bank's and the OCC's methods, it was believed that there existed a legitimate difference of opinion regarding a systematic and rational approach to accounting for this complex transaction. The ombudsman clearly acknowledged that there could be different judgments made, and different conclusions reached, on the asset valuations. Therefore, the ombudsman opined that the most appropriate resolution of this difference of opinion rested with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accounting division. The bank was directed to contact the SEC to discuss the accounting treatment for this transaction.Contract No. 2BackgroundIn a separate agreement the affinity group's affiliate agreed to pay the bank a percentage of the shortfall if a specified rate of return was not met. This gross profit adjustment was recorded as a prepaid asset. This receivable was recorded during the early years of the contract but was not payable by the affiliate until the expiration of the 16-year contract.DiscussionThe bank believed that the prepaid asset was fully bankable, based on the unconditional contractual obligation of the affiliate, and therefore carried it at full value. The OCC concluded that the bank's accounting treatment for this asset was inappropriate. The OCC considered this prepaid asset to be a gain contingency, and as such, under GAAP it should not be recognized until payment is realized. The bank was of the opinion that the asset had economic value, and therefore, the OCC should not impose an accounting treatment that assigns no value.ConclusionIn considering all of the dimensions of the prepaid asset, the ombudsman opined that it was appropriate to recognize the revenue. However, in light of the extended time period required to receive payment, it would have been more appropriate to record the prepaid asset at a discounted value. Therefore, the bank was directed to adjust its books to reflect the discounted value of the asset for each of the periods in question and amend the call reports as appropriate.

        "webpage": "Compare Commodity and Equity Funds on the Islamic Market\nIf you're looking to build a sharia-compliant investment portfolio with the potential for significant growth (as opposed to a portfolio focused mostly on safeguarding your funds), chances are good you want to include funds that invest in commodities and/or those that invest in equities. As with conventional funds of this type, the Islamic variety of commodity and equity funds present some risk to the investor because you can't know with certainty that the price of a certain commodity or a company stock is going to increase. No way around it: You can't hope for returns without facing some associated risks. That's just the nature of investing, Islamic and otherwise!\nCommodity funds and Islamic finance\nCommodity funds may invest in purchases or projects based either on the cost plus murabaha contract or, in the case of construction projects (or other projects to be completed in the future), the leasing (ijara) contract.\nIn the conventional market, many types of commodity funds are available that allow you to invest in oil, wheat, pork bellies, orange juice, and so on. Conventional investors (who don't necessarily want to see and touch the commodities in question) look to fund management companies to make savvy trades  -  often using derivative products  -  to garner profits from the commodity's price changes.\nIslamic commodity funds also invest in physical commodities but must avoid short selling as well as investment products of a speculative nature, such as commodity futures. In an Islamic commodity fund, the commodities are actually purchased for resale. (The fund management company doesn't try to short sell a commodity security, for example.) The profit from the sale is distributed among the investors according to the investment contract.\nIn order to be accepted as sharia-compliant, the commodity fund must meet the following basic criteria:\nThe commodities involved can't be prohibited in Islam. In other words, no pork, alcohol, or other forbidden items.\nShort selling isn't allowed. The seller must actually have possession of the commodities in question.\nAll parties involved must know the price of the commodities to be traded.\nForward sales aren't allowed, except under salam and istisna contracts.\nHere are just two examples of existing Islamic commodity funds:\nRiyad Capital Bank in Saudi Arabia has two Commodity Trading Funds available to investors. One fund deals in U.S. dollars, and the other deals in Saudi Riyals; both are sharia-compliant.\nAl Rajhi Capital, also in Saudi Arabia, offers three commodity fund products: a U.S. dollar commodity fund, a Saudi Riyal commodity fund, and a Euro commodity fund.\nEquity funds and Islamic finance\nAn equity fund gains profit by buying and selling stocks to achieve capital gains and by receiving corporate dividends. The capital gains and dividends are distributed among investors proportionally according to the size of each person's investment. The key difference between an Islamic and conventional equity fund is the requirement for an Islamic equity fund to invest in sharia-compliant assets.\nIslamic equity funds really opened the door to investing for people seeking to purchase sharia-compliant stocks and to make socially responsible investments. And because these funds avoid investing in companies that are highly leveraged with debt, Islamic equity funds may have a performance advantage over some of their conventional counterparts. The drawback is that the investment criteria for inclusion in an Islamic fund are strict enough to eliminate certain industries altogether, which can negatively affect such funds during economic downturns. (As with all things in the investment world, Islamic equity funds have their pros and cons!)\nHere are just three examples of the hundreds of Islamic equity funds currently available:\nMalaysia's AmIslamic Funds Management launched the AmASEAN Equity Fund (AMASEQY) in 2011. The fund's investments focus on the nations of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. HSBC Amanah GCC Equity Fund (SAMGCCE), launched in 2006 and managed by HSBC Saudia Arabia, strives for medium- and long-term capital growth by making investments in sharia-compliant products and services in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, and by offering wholesale banking (Islamic financing/Sukuk) globally through those countries.\nLaunched in 2003, the Meezan Islamic Fund (MEZISLM) is a product of Al Meezan Investment Management Limited. The management company's website states that this fund is \"not only Pakistan's largest Shariah compliant equity fund but also Pakistan's largest equity fund in the private sector.\"\nTypes of Sukuk in Islamic Finance\nSharia Boards and Islamic Financial Institutions\nTypes of Islamic Financial Products\nThe Mudaraba Contract in Islamic Finance\nRisks Unique to Islamic Finance\nHigh-Powered Investing All-in-One For Dummies, 2nd Edition"

Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the Aging Committee.The committee held a hearing Wednesday after issuing a bipartisan report showing that Social Security has closed 64 field offices since 2010.In addition, the agency has closed 533 temporary mobile offices that often serve remote areas. Hours have been reduced in the 1,245 field offices that are still open, the report said.As a result, seniors seeking information and help from the agency are facing increasingly long waits, in person and on the phone, the report said.\"They don't do any kind of analysis on what would happen to a community when their field office closes, including figuring out how the most vulnerable populations would make their way to the next-closest office,\" said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., chairman of the Aging Committee.The closings come as applications for retirement and disability benefits are soaring, a trend that will continue as aging baby boomers approach retirement.More than 47 million people receive Social Security retirement benefits, nearly a 20 percent increase from a decade ago. About 11 million people receive Social Security disability benefits, a 38 percent increase from a decade ago.The Social Security Administration has been encouraging people to access services online. The agency has upgraded its website in recent years, including secure connections to access confidential information. People can apply for benefits without ever visiting Social Security offices.In 2013, nearly half of all retirement applications were filed online, the report said.But the committee report notes that many older Americans lack access to the Internet or might not be comfortable using it to apply for benefits.Last year, more than 43 million people visited Social Security field offices. About 43 percent of those seeking an appointment had to wait more than three weeks, up from just 10 percent the year before, the report said.About 10 percent of visitors to Social Security offices are applying for benefits, Berryhill said. The largest group, about 30 percent, are seeking new or replacement Social Security cards.Berryhill said Social Security officials do annual reviews to determine whether offices should be expanded, reduced or closed.\"Once we make the decision to consolidate an office, we discuss the changes with stakeholders,\" Berryhill said. \"We hold town hall meetings or other forums that allow the public to voice their concerns. We contact key community leaders.\"Like many federal agencies, Social Security has faced budget cuts in recent years. After two years of shrinking budgets, the agency got a 6 percent increase this year, to $11.8 billion.Social Security has cut its workforce by 11,000 employees over the past three years, Berryhill said.She said the agency saves an average of $4 million over the course of a decade for every field office it closes.\"I can hire a lot of employees with $4 million,\" Berryhill said."

        "webpage": "New tax lessons from the left coast\nPublished November 12. 2012 12:01AM Californians proved last week that voters will approve of tax increases if they have assurances that elected leaders will put the additional revenues to good purposes. In an outcome that surprised many, on Tuesday Golden State voters approved the Proposition 30 ballot measure requiring a tax increase that will raise about $6 billion a year.Gov. Jerry Brown proposed the initiative as a way of finding funding for California's public schools and university system. For years California has been cutting spending to its public schools, leading to large classroom sizes, teacher layoffs, a lack of materials, and continued use of outdated schools. It has hindered efforts at education reform. Meanwhile the state's university system, once well-regarded for being affordable to in-state students, has seen a steady rise in tuition costs and fewer admissions. Community colleges will now increase the staffing necessary to add 20,000 new students, thanks to the added revenues.The approval of the ballot initiative increases the California state sales tax by one-quarter of 1 percent and calls for graduated state income tax increases on those making $250,000 or more.While it may surprise some that voters anywhere would vote to impose tax increases on themselves, it seems all the more remarkable in California. Remember, this is the land of Proposition 13. Passed in 1978 it placed an arbitrary limit on increases in property taxes and required a two-thirds vote of both houses of the California legislature to pass any tax increases.The measure produced many unintended consequences. It has retarded home sales, placed California in a state of seemingly permanent fiscal crisis and led to a hodge-podge of special taxes and fees at the local level to try to get around its revenue-restricting measures.In another interesting development, voters there also gave Democrats two-thirds control of both houses of the California legislature, providing that party the ability to raise taxes without Republican votes. But Gov. Brown said he would block any efforts to use the supermajority for a spending spree or to boost taxes to support it, mindful that such a move could be seen as an affront to voters who just approved the Proposition 30 tax measure.The larger context, however, is that the California vote challenges the notion that voters never, ever want to see taxes increased. In reality, a majority of voters recognize that taxes sometimes have to go up. It is a lesson that should guide the debate soon to come in Washington about how to slow the growth of the federal deficit and begin to get the U.S. budget in balance. Both pre-election and exit polls showed a majority of voters support President Obama's call to allow the income tax rate on wealthier individuals to return to a pre-Bush level.While not as dramatic as the California vote, we noted last week that Connecticut Republicans, in an effort to win seats in the state House and Senate, had campaigned against the tax increases approved under Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's administration to address this state's fiscal crisis. The strategy produced no net gain for Republicans in a Connecticut General Assembly still controlled by the Democratic Party.At any level of government a balanced approached is best when it comes to tax and spending policies. How best to achieve that balance, however, is where political ideologies clash. California voters have mandated that more revenues are necessary to provide better balance there. Now it is time for Republicans in Washington to recognize, in the wake of the president's victory, that when it comes to tax policy they have to give a little too.\nState legislators make quick work of closing budget gap"

Ireland\nHow to do business in...Gareth Magee Wednesday 25 June 2014 In the latest of our series to help the Scottish business community, Gareth Magee gives an insight into how to do business in Ireland.\nIn the latest of our series to help the Scottish business community, Gareth Magee gives an insight into how to do business in Ireland.\nPopulation: 4.5 million\nCapital city: Dublin\nGDP: Approx. US$210 billion\nIreland's reputation as a booming economy and an attractive place to do business took something of a battering during and after the financial crisis. But while the much-vaunted Celtic Tiger of the late 90s and early noughties may now seem a distant memory, Ireland is staging a defiant recovery.\nThe country's credit rating was upgraded in May by Moody's, which returned it to a \"stable outlook\", while the same month saw the European Commission forecast GDP growth of 1.7% in 2014 and 3% in 2015.\nIreland has long been a popular business outlet for firms in Scotland and currently receives over \u00a3500 million a year in Scottish exports. Ireland is also popular with a large number of multinationals, thanks partly to one of the lowest corporation tax levels in the developed world. Its charge of 12.5% has helped it attract firms including Pfizer, Intel, Microsoft and Google (which has its largest non-US presence in Dublin).\nThat low rate of corporation tax isn't the only advantage on the table for Scottish firms doing business in Ireland. There's also a favourable holding company regime, low tax on dividends and a research and development (R&D) tax credit of 25%. That R&D incentive has encouraged almost 1,000 overseas companies to make the country their European base.\nFor Scottish firms the similarities to the domestic market may be more important than the differences. Business is conducted in English, while office hours, the time-zone, the easy access and most holidays are broadly the same as in Scotland.\nThen, of course, you can factor in the ease of access and a population that understands and is familiar with many Scottish goods and services.\nThe legal and regulatory structure is largely similar too and most EU directives relating to company law have been implemented in both the UK and Ireland.\nWhen it comes to setting up the most popular option is to become a private company limited by shares. This is especially the case for firms investing into the country, partly due to the limited liability for shareholders.\nThere are the inevitable drawbacks to investing into Ireland or setting up a base in the country. Ireland was among the hardest hit by the financial crisis and while it has improved recently, economic confidence has been badly dented.\nThe cost of doing business has increased of late, as in the UK. Ireland's National Competitiveness Council warned in April 2014 that it was still a high-cost place to do business and that costs were being driven upwards, albeit more by external than domestic pressures.\nBut there are clearly some compelling reasons why a Scottish company may set up an Irish branch or invest into the country. The proximity, familiarity and cultural overlap are among them, but for the growing number of global giants setting up in Ireland there are a host of other factors that make it an attractive place to do business.\nGareth Magee is a partner at Scott-Moncrieff, leading accountants and business advisors, which, through its membership of the Moore Stephens network, helps Scottish businesses realise their international potential.\nThe full 'Doing Business in Ireland' guide, including information about setting up, and tax laws, produced in association with Moore Stephens International, can be found here.\nRelated Articles: Ryanair in bid to buy Aer Lingus Contextual targeting label: Business Tweet"

Schlinker, Press Secretary for Accident Fund Holdings, Inc., at 517-708-5653 or  LANSING, MI - The latest Michigan Future Business Index survey of small and midsize business leaders shows the state's job providers 'tapping the breaks' due to a variety of national economic uncertainties. While business owners say they remain optimistic that Michigan is headed in the right direction, they also say their shrinking bottom lines are causing them to take a second look at earlier hiring and wage increase plans. \"These surveys are very useful to Accident Fund for taking the economic pulse of small and midsize business owners,\" Mike Britt, president of Accident Fund Insurance Company of America, which commissions the survey, said. \"Small business is the core of our state's economy, and they're concerned that the slowed national economy, coupled with a new dose of regulations will temper Michigan's economic recovery and job growth just as we're on the mend. Small and midsize businesses are our customers, so their feelings about the economy are as important to us as they are to them.\"\nBritt added that the survey shows quite a bit of good news. There are signs that business leaders believe Michigan's recovery continues, albeit at a slower pace, with survey respondents reporting continued growing sales, and more of them revealing plans for new product and service line launches and location openings. Dissatisfaction with the state's economy has ticked up one point since June to 57 percent, while satisfaction has dropped two points to 41 percent, though satisfaction with the economy is still 14 points stronger now than it was a year ago. Additionally, the percentage of businesses with new hires is still 20 points higher than one year ago, but statistically unchanged since June of this year. New hiring remained the strongest in West Michigan and there has been a significant increase in hiring among larger businesses (35%) as well as those in construction, manufacturing and distribution (26%). Also a positive sign, 40 percent of business owners reported in the latest MFBI survey that sales had increased over the previous six months, a two-point increase from the June 2012 survey.\nOther positive results from the survey include:\nSix-month business outlook. While optimism has ebbed slightly since June, a majority (52 percent) of respondents still believe the business outlook for the next six months remains good, with 17 percent saying it is \"very good.\" Hiring and layoffs. Twenty-four percent of respondents said they plan to hire more employees in the next six months. While that number is two points lower than it was in June, it's still nine points higher than in October 2011. The outlook for new hires remains strongest in the Detroit Metro region (26%). Larger businesses and new businesses, especially childcare, are hiring the most new employees (33%).\nIncreased wages. The outlook for increased wages continues to improve marginally, as 26 percent of respondents said they plan to increase wages for their employees within the next six months - up two points from 24 percent in June 2012. Employers in West Michigan are most likely to increase wages for workers, with 32 percent indicating they will do so. Additionally, wages are most likely to climb within the financial, insurance and real estate sectors - 32 percent of those employers said they will raise compensation.\n\"The results of this latest Future Business Index survey are less encouraging than I had hoped,\" said Chris Holman, CEO of the Michigan Business Network and publisher of the Greater Lansing Business Monthly. \"Michigan is still in a vulnerable position at this infancy stage of recovery. The current concerns over the 'fiscal cliff' and the growing anxiety over added health care costs are causing Michigan businesses to recalculate their strategies for capital and human resource investments. We need to see quick action by the President and Congress on these two issues to ease uncertainty and reignite the recovery.\"\nThe Michigan Future Business Index, commissioned by Accident Fund and the Michigan Business Network, is conducted semi-annually by Marketing Resource Group, Inc. (MRG). The survey has been conducted since 2006. A total of 1,015 Michigan business owners, operators, officers and managers were interviewed for the October 2012 survey.\nTo view a summary of the most recent Michigan Future Business Index, please visit the Accident Fund Insurance Company of America website at  or the Michigan Business Network website at .

        "webpage": "Opinion | Commentary Minimum wage target too low\nThere appears to be a good chance the Legislature will increase the minimum wage this session, but so far it has set its sights too low. The Legislature needs to look beyond the $10.10 an hour that President Obama and Gov. Peter Shumlin have proposed and think in terms of what a Vermont family needs to live on.Full-time work ought to support a decent standard of living. People who work 40 hours a week, year round, ought to have at least enough income to support their families and meet their basic needs.The Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., and the Vermont Legislature\ufffds Joint Fiscal Office calculate that a basic family budget for a single parent with one child is close to $50,000 a year. For a family of two working parents with two children, it\ufffds $70,000 to $75,000.Vermont can\ufffdt raise the minimum wage to $25 or $30 or $35 an hour, and it probably can\ufffdt even guarantee a livable income for a full-time working mother with just a single child. But by raising the minimum wage to $11.50 or $12 an hour and expanding the state\ufffds tax credit for low-income, working families, Vermont could begin to close the huge gap between the cost of a decent standard of living and what most low-wage workers have to live on.Combining an increase in the minimum wage with an increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for low-wage workers was the subject of a paper by Jeannette Wicks-Lim, an economist at the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts and an expert on the minimum wage. She discussed her research with a Vermont Senate committee last week. She also refuted a commonly heard claim that raising the minimum wage hurts the economy and costs jobs. Wicks-Lim told the committee that research had found little or no negative effect from raising the floor on wages.Her testimony was reinforced by Phil Merrick, owner of August First Bakery and Caf\ufffd in Burlington. As a business owner, he said he supported a higher minimum wage because it was the right thing to do and would help the economy by putting more money in the pockets of people who would spend it immediately\ufffdand in Vermont. The cost of the minimum wage proposed by the governor would be inconsequential to his customers, Merrick said. And he thinks the wage increase should be higher than the governor recommended.Vermont, like the rest of the country, has seen a growing gap between rich and poor. Raising the minimum wage alone isn\ufffdt going to close that income gap. There are many other steps that need to be taken. But raising the minimum wage can help, especially if it\ufffds coupled with an increase in the EITC that gets full-time workers closer to a livable income. And those changes need to be part of a broader commitment among policy makers to reduce income inequality in Vermont.Jack Hoffman is a policy analyst for Public Assets Institute (), a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization based in Montpelier."

Please return to our main page Home // About the CFTC // CFTC Reports // Strategic Plan 2011-2015\nGoal 2 Introduction\nIn fostering financially sound markets, the Com-mission's main priorities are to avoid disruptions to the system for clearing and settling contract obligations and to protect the funds that customers entrust to futures commission merchants (FCMs). Clearing organizations and FCMs are integral to the financial integrity of derivatives transactions - together, they protect against the financial difficulties of one trader becoming a systemic problem. Several aspects of the regulatory framework that contribute to the Commission achieving this goal are: 1) requiring that market participants post margin to secure their ability to fulfill financial obligations; 2) requiring participants on the losing side of trades to meet their obligations, in cash, through daily (sometimes intraday) margin calls; 3) requiring FCMs to maintain minimum levels of operating capital; and 4) requiring FCMs to segregate customer funds from their own funds.\nThe Commission works with the exchanges and the National Futures Association (NFA) to closely monitor the financial condition of the FCMs themselves, who must provide the Commission, exchanges, and NFA with various monthly, quarterly, and annual financial reports. The exchanges and NFA conduct routine, periodic audits and daily financial surveillance of their respective member FCMs. As a regulator, the Commission reviews the audit and financial surveillance programs of the exchanges and NFA and also monitors the financial condition of FCMs directly, as appropriate. This includes reviewing each FCM's exposure to risk from large customer positions that it carries. The Commission also conducts extensive daily surveillance of risks posed by traders, firms, and derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) and periodically reviews clearing organization procedures for monitoring risks and protecting customer funds.\nThe Commission works with the NFA to ensure that those seeking registration as intermediaries meet high qualification and fitness standards through the registration process. The Commission also drafts and interprets rules that apply to the conduct of business by these intermediaries. In 2010, the Commission adopted new registration, capital, and other requirements for retail foreign exchange dealers (RFEDs) that may act as counterparties for off-exchange foreign currency transactions involving retail participants. RFEDs are subject to similar financial requirements, and similar oversight, as the FCMs.\nUnder the CEA, DCOs must demonstrate compliance with core principles that require, among other things: 1) adequate financial, operational, and managerial resources; 2) appropriate standards for participant and product eligibility; 3) adequate and appropriate risk management capabilities; 4) the ability to complete settlements on a timely basis under varying circumstances; 5) standards and procedures to protect member and participant funds; 6) efficient and fair default rules and procedures; 7) adequate rule enforcement and dispute resolution procedures; and 8) adequate and appropriate systems safeguards, emergency procedures, and plans for disaster recovery. The Commission conducts periodic reviews of DCOs for their compliance with core principle requirements. The Commission surveys DCO exposures on a daily basis and compares such exposures to DCO financial resources. Additionally, the CFTC may review and approve DCO rules.\nWith the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission will have substantially greater responsibilities, including oversight of newly registered derivatives dealers, as well as implementation of enhanced compliance requirements for intermediaries and new core principle requirements for DCOs. The Commission also will be responsible for determining the initial eligibility or the continuing qualification of a DCO to clear swaps, as well as for the review of swaps submitted to the Commission for a determination as to whether the swaps are required to be cleared. The Commission also will be implementing new statutory provisions regarding review of new rules and rule amendments submitted by DCOs. In addition, the scope of the Commission's reviews of DCOs, designated self-regulatory organizations (DSROs), and intermediaries will be expanded to include swap transactions and swap intermediaries.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act creates a new category of systemically important DCOs. These entities will have to comply with heightened risk management and other prudential standards. The Commission will be required to examine systemically important DCOs at least yearly. The Commission also has to ensure that all DCOs comply and bring their rules up to the new Dodd-Frank Act core principles and thus, the Commission intends to examine all DCOs on an annual basis. The Commission likely will see an increase in the number of DCOs seeking registration, including entities that are located outside the United States, from 15 (January 10, 2011) to at least 20. The additional clearinghouses that will register as DCOs likely will clear many more products that will require analysis. The risk profile of these cleared products will be more complex than traditional futures and options. As such, the clearing oversight program's risk surveillance function will have to grow so that the CFTC can continue to effectively discharge its statutory duty to reduce systemic risk.\nTo implement these authorities, the CFTC will create a new group for the oversight of swaps dealers and intermediaries. A significant increase in staff focused on the development and implementation of regulations and programs in this previously unregulated arena will also be necessary.\n< Previous Page | Table of Contents | Next Page >"

        "webpage": "Playing Hunger Games with Food Stamps\nMonica Potts September 20, 2013 The House decides to cut $40 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which could leave millions of impoverished families without food.\nWhen the House voted yesterday to cut $40 billion from the food-stamp program, they doubled the cuts the House had previously considered. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 3.8 million people will be taken off the program, primarily because the House is removing some of the flexibility states have to meet the needs of their communities. They are restoring strict federal rules to the program. That's an odd move for a bunch of Republicans.\nMost of the people who will be removed from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program's (SNAP) rolls are adults in high unemployment areas who don't have children and can't find jobs, and families with gross incomes that are slightly higher than the poverty line, but whose disposable incomes fall below it. These changes were introduced a few years ago to meet a rising need. The poverty line is low, and doesn't take into account how much families spend on the costs of necessities like housing and childcare. More than half of all food stamp recipients are working. More than 80 percent of families with children are. They just aren't earning enough to feed their children.\nWhen conservatives express concern over the rise in food stamp use under the Obama administration, they often ignore the fact that the rise coincides with the recession and jobless recovery that followed. There's also very little fraud - the federal government carefully monitors this program. Critics always point to the 47 million Americans who rely on food stamps, up from about 20 million before the recession without acknowledging the more troubling fact underpinning the data - that 47 million Americans are hungry. Actually, more than that are probably hungry. Before the financial meltdown, food stamps reached about half of those eligible; after they reached about three-quarters of eligible households. It's partly because the federal government gave states more flexibility to get food stamps to people they felt needed them, but mostly because people with low incomes had nowhere else to go for help in the downturn. Families typically wait until the last minute to get aid, no matter how poor they are.\nIf we are really concerned about the growth of the food-stamp program, there are other ways to tackle it without living millions of families without food. Improving the economy, as each cycle of Congress has promised to do, would be a start. Raising the minimum wage would do it too; all of the working parents on the program would make more. Without those changes, it seems conservatives in Congress aren't concerned with the rising need for food stamps. They're upset because more people are using them.\nHow the GOP Plans to Cut Affordable Housing (Again)Monica Potts A 2008 program to help tens of thousands on housing waitlists is finally set to be funded, but House Republicans have other plans.\nMonica Potts is a freelance writer, and former staff member of The American Prospect.

        "webpage": "Credit Unions Won't Feel FICO Effect\nAugust 22, 2014 \u2022 Reprints Upcoming changes in the way FICO scores are calculated are designed to help more consumers qualify for better loan rates. However, the adjustments may not have much impact on credit union loan growth.\nThe new scores will give less weight to unpaid medical bills when assessing consumer creditworthiness. The San Jose, Calif., firm also said criteria will be revised so borrowers who have settled collection agency bills won't be unfairly penalized.\nFICO said the new criteria will be implemented some time this fall.\nRatings issued by FICO are used to determine credit scores for nearly 90% of the country's consumer lending decisions.\nTheoretically, the consumer impact of the changes could be huge given the number of people who struggle with medical bills. As of July, 64.3 million consumers showed some level of unpaid medical debt on their credit reports, according to credit bureau Experian. Of the 106.5 million consumers contacted by collection agencies, 9.4 million had no balance left on their accounts and would not be penalized under the new requirements.\nHowever, credit unions may not see an influx of new loans, because medical bills and paid accounts have long been part and parcel of their internal underwriting policies.\n\"I do not have all of the technical details on how the FICO score algorithms will change, but I think, in the big picture, it doesn't impact us that much,\" said Bill Vogeney EVP and chief lending officer for $4 billion Ent Federal Credit Union in Colorado Springs, Colo. \"When we manually underwrite a consumer loan one of the things we have worked hard at is making sure we overlook reasonable medical collection accounts.\"\nEnt FCU's current loan portfolio of $2.5 billion is split almost equally between mortgage loans and all other consumer loans combined, Vogeney, chair of the CUNA Lending Council executive committee said. About 38% of the credit union's loans are processed through automatic underwriting, meaning 62% receive manual processing, thus are considered in light of a reduced influence of medical bills.\n\"A consumer with a 620 FICO score with multiple collections is more likely to get some additional consideration from us,\" Vogeney said. \"I think that would impact about 5% to 10% of our members.\"\nAmy Perez, assistant vice president of retail lending for $2 billion Grow Financial Federal Credit Union in Tampa, Fla., also believed most credit unions take medical debt and member performance into account when making loan decisions. But whatever adjustments are made to a credit union's loan evaluation system will not take place until the institutions reviews and changes its credit scoring model, she said.\n\"The decision to change to a new scoring model is extremely slow moving throughout our industry,\" Perez said. \"We validate our scoring models against our lending portfolio every other year; therefore, it will likely be some time before we consider a change.\"\nGrow Financial has a loan portfolio of $1.6 billion, about 60% of which is comprised of consumer loans, Perez said. The credit union generates $40 million to $50 million per month in consumer loans, many of which are made with internal underwriting standards that already mirror the new FICO guidance.\n\"At Grow, we weigh medical and paid collections less heavily in our overall decision,\" Perez said. \"If we were to move to this model immediately, it would likely be more predictive of the way we are underwriting today.\"\nThe change in the FICO score calibration comes in the wake of a May 20 CFPB report that said consumer creditworthiness may be undervalued by as much as 10 points for borrowers who show medical debt on their credit scores. The current ratings system also undervalues a borrower's creditworthiness after settling the medical debt, an oversight that can devalue consumer credit scores by up to 22 points.\nThe CFPB research report also found shortcomings in the FICO score calculation for consumers whose debt went to collection agencies. Both categories were addressed in the recent FICO score recalibrations.\n\"Getting sick or injured can put all sorts of burdens on a family, including unexpected medical costs. Those costs should not be compounded by overly penalizing a consumer's credit score,\" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said at the time of the report's release. \"Given the role that credit scores play in consumers' lives, it's important that they predict the creditworthiness of a consumer as precisely as possible.\"\nBoth Vogeney and Perez laud the new standards, but agree that they may be old news for many credit unions, and those that do make changes may take some time to implement them depending on which credit scoring model they're using. Perez also cautioned that credit scores alone should not be the sole factor in determining member creditworthiness.\n\"If a change needs to be made to a scoring model to make it more predictive of actual borrower risk, then it should be made,\" Perez said. \"But our borrowers are more than their credit scores, which is why we have a team of highly trained underwriters who are able to see past the score to the bigger picture.\" Show Comments"

        "webpage": "The Intelligent Investor\nWhy You Shouldn't Buy Those Quarterly Earnings Surprises\nJason Zweig\nEveryone loves surprises. But perhaps you shouldn't get too excited over them. This month, market strategists, television commentators and other investing pundits will bombard you with breathless updates on the percentage of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that have reported profits even higher than what analysts expected - in Wall Street lingo, a \"positive earnings surprise.\" ENLARGE\nChristophe Vorlet\nThe percentage of companies that have beaten expectations often is cited as a barometer of corporate profitability, an indicator of how well the economy as a whole is doing or a predictor of where the stock market is going. What goes unsaid, however, is that these positive surprises are becoming so common they are nearly universal. They are predetermined in a cynical tango-clinch between companies and the analysts who cover them. And there is no reliable evidence that the stock market as a whole will earn higher returns after periods with more positive surprises. In the first quarter of 2011, according to Bianco Research, 68% of the companies in the S&P 500 earned more than the consensus, or median, forecast by analysts. What's more, that quarter was the ninth in a row when at least two-thirds of the companies in the S&P generated positive surprises - and the 50th consecutive quarter in which at least half of the companies surpassed the consensus forecast of their earnings. Even in the depths of the financial crisis, from the third quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009, between 59% and 66% of companies beat expectations, according to Wharton Research Data Services, or WRDS. In short, there isn't anything surprising about earnings surprises. They aren't the exception; they are the rule. \"All the numbers are gamed at this point,\" says James A. Bianco, president of Bianco Research. With trading volumes down on Wall Street and commission rates near record-low levels, brokerage firms are starved for the revenue that stock trading used to provide. Since changes in earnings forecasts encourage many investors to buy or sell, analysts have an incentive to revise their predictions more often. But that hasn't made the forecasts more accurate. On average, according to Denys Glushkov, research director at WRDS, stock analysts are revising their earnings forecasts nearly twice as frequently as they did a decade ago. And while the typical forecast missed the mark by 1% in the 1990s, that margin of error has lately been running at triple that rate. What's going on here? In what used to be called \"lowballing\" but now goes by the euphemism of \"guidance,\" an analyst will guesstimate what a company will earn over the next year or calendar quarter. Then the company \"walks down\" the analyst's forecast by providing a series of progressively lower targets until the analyst's prediction falls slightly below where the actual number is likely to come out. Voila: The company gets to announce earnings that are better than expected, while the analyst gets to tell his investing clients that his estimate was pretty accurate and conservative to boot. According to a survey of 269 members by the National Investor Relations Institute, 90% provide guidance in one form or another, most commonly on earnings and revenues over the coming four quarters. No more than 5% offer any guidance on results further than one year into the future. Refusing to dance this cynical tango isn't always easy. \"If you cut back or eliminate guidance, management needs to be prepared for the possibility of more volatility in the stock price and a wider range in analysts' estimates,\" says Barbara Gasper, head of investor relations at MasterCard,\nwhich doesn't give short-term guidance. Instead, it provides three-year targets for sales and profitability, leaving analysts at least partly on their own to form interim forecasts of the company's earnings. Somehow, the stock has survived. You might think that positive earnings surprises would be good for future returns of the stock market overall. Companies that report positive surprises still get a short-term pop in their stock price, even though the smartest investors realize the surprise is a staged event. In any case, the pop in those stock prices tends to fade over time. And an increase in the proportion of companies reporting positive surprises in one quarter, says Mr. Glushkov of WRDS, \"does not have consistent forecasting power for S&P 500 returns in the next quarter.\" With analysts playing the guidance game more than ever, their forecasts tell us less than ever about where the stock market is going. So over the next few weeks, don't be fooled into thinking that there is anything surprising about the flood of positive earnings surprises. And don't believe anyone who tries to tell you that these fake surprises mean nothing but good times are ahead for the economy and the stock market.  -  ;  Write to Jason Zweig at  Save Article"

        "webpage": "Ansbacher: Writing success Dodd-Frank swap reporting requirements will be met: DTCC\nPromise made in Senate testimony\nJuly 17, 2012 \u2022 Reprints The following is from the DTCC...\nThe Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) today testified before a Senate Committee that the company is fully prepared to meet the September deadline for compliance with new swap data reporting requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act.\nDuring a hearing of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, entitled \"Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: 2 Years Later,\" Larry Thompson, DTCC Managing Director and General Counsel, told the Committee that two DTCC subsidiaries have already applied for registration with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to operate as swap data repositories for all OTC derivatives asset classes - credit, interest rate, commodity, equity, and foreign exchange (FX). These new SDRs will be operational for interest rate and credit swaps in August - well in advance of the mid-September reporting deadline.\n\"DTCC will be ready on Day One to meet the new reporting requirements,\" Thompson said. \"Over the past two years, DTCC has made substantial investments to design, develop and implement systems to support swap data reporting for all five OTC derivative asset classes. This infrastructure has been designed with maximum flexibility so that it can evolve over time to meet the changing needs of regulators and market participants. Regulators can leverage these resources in their efforts to enhance market transparency and ensure a safe and sound financial system.\"\nDTCC's ability to provide transparency into OTC derivatives markets predates the adoption of Dodd-Frank and reflects extensive experience operating the centralized, comprehensive global electronic data repository for the credit default swap (CDS) market, which holds detailed trade information on more than 98 percent of all CDS transactions globally.\nComprehensive global market information is published weekly by DTCC and is made available at no cost to regulators and the public at . DTCC also launched a \"Regulatory Portal\" in January 2011 to give regulators efficient access to more granular data. Today, over 40 regulators worldwide are accessing the portal, including U.S., European, and Asian authorities as well as regulators from other regions.\n\"Against the backdrop of the sovereign debt crises, corporate failures, credit downgrades and significant losses by financial institutions as a result of OTC derivatives transactions, data transparency in the CDS market achieved through voluntary industry reporting has helped to ensure market stability during times of volatility and given supervisors and the public the ability to more fully understand risk concentrations and levels of exposure,\" Thompson said.\nThompson said that while transparency represents an important first step in giving regulators the tools they need to better understand systemic risk and more effectively perform market surveillance and oversight, the next step involves regulators acquiring the analytical tools to red flag excessive risk-taking so they can take action quickly to prevent or mitigate systemic shocks to the financial system.\n\"Regulators must have the appropriate tools to analyze the data for both systemic risk oversight purposes and to identify potential abusive or manipulative market behavior,\" Thompson said. \"Having the raw data is important, but unless regulators are equipped with the necessary resources to understand and analyze the data, the full benefits of reporting swap transactions will not be realized. It is critical, for reasons of both time and money, that regulators leverage the capabilities of existing infrastructures to develop the necessary tools needed to identify certain risky behaviors on an automated basis.\"\nThompson also urged regulators to implement new reporting mandates that ensure the continued aggregation of swaps data. DTCC has raised concerns previously over the indemnification provisions of Dodd-Frank, which could fragment the global data set for OTC derivatives and undermine efforts to increase market transparency.\nIn addition, Thompson noted that the public sector is not currently in the position to allocate scarce resources and the extensive time needed to develop data collection and reference data efforts, like the Legal Entity Identifier initiative. DTCC has suggested that the industry shoulder these costs in order to free up the public sector to make investments in developing critical analytical tools and perform required oversight.\nCFTC Chair talks to commercial hedgers CFTC grants registration to 18 Swap Execution Facilities JP Morgan acknowledges wrongdoing, will pay $267 million SEC fine for failing to disclose conflicts CFTC orders JPMorgan Chase Bank to pay $100 million for failure to disclose conflicts of interest CFTC Chairman Massad speaks at the FIA Futures and Options Expo Previous\nBrothers who allegedly sold short recklessly agree to pay $14.5 M to settle\nPeregrine's fraud went undetected in two U.S. agency reviews\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission 1290analytical tools 16Senate Committee on Agriculture 11Nutrition and Forestry 10Clearing Corporation 8Depository Trust 7Senate Committee 3Larry Thompson 3appropriate tools 2implement systems 1"

These include raising awareness of Japan's foreign bribery offence - the Unfair Competition Prevention Law (UCPL) - among the legal profession and providing clearer information on the UCPL to business. It also appears that the police and prosecutors, and other agencies such as the National Tax Agency and Financial Service Agency's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, are beginning to more closely coordinate and share information. These developments have the potential for facilitating the more active detection, investigation and prosecution of foreign bribery cases.\nThe Working Group - made up of the 34 OECD Member countries plus Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Russia and South Africa - adopted Japan's report under its third phase of monitoring. The Report, available at , lists all the recommendations of the Working Group on pages 41-44, and includes an overview of Japan's legal and policy framework for combating the bribery of foreign public officials. Japan will report to the Working Group on progress in June 2012. Following the usual process, Japan will also make an oral report in December 2012 and a further written report within two years (December 2013), which will be the basis of a publicly-available Working Group evaluation of Japan's implementation of the Phase 3 recommendations.\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Mary Crane-Charef, OECD Anti-Corruption Division Communications Officer, e-mail ; telephone (33) 1 45 24 97 04.

        "webpage": "Useless Money: Production \"Error\" to Cause Delay in New $100 Bill Debut\nThe US government said it is still trying to identify the source of the production glitch that forced it to postpone introducing the new $100 bill and could force it to shred hundreds of millions of error-ridden bills. The issue stems from what officials called a \"problem with sporadic creasing of the paper during printing\" that resulted in blanks spots on some of the newly redesigned bills.\nOfficials at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing are working with Crane & Co., the Massachusetts company which has supplied the government with paper for currency for more than 130 years, to identify what caused the errors, but it's unclear if the problem was caused by Crane's paper or some other element of the printing process.\nA person familiar with the situation said that at the height of the printing process, as many as 30 percent of the bills rolling off the printing press included the flaw, leading to the production shut down.\nThe government said it believes most of the 1.1 billion bills already printed can be salvaged, but any of the bills that were misprinted will have to be shredded.\nAccording to a source familiar with the matter, the bills are the most costly ever produced, with a per-note cost of about 12 cents - twice the cost of a conventional bill. That means the government spent about $120 million to produce bills it can't use. On top of that, it is not yet clear how much more it will cost to sort the existing horde of hundred dollar bills.\nSorting such a huge quantity of bills by hand, the officials estimate, could take between 20 and 30 years. Using a mechanized system, they think they could sort the massive pile of bills in about one year.\nThe new $100 bills feature an array of new security features aimed at thwarting counterfeiters, including a blue 3-D security ribbon with small images of bells that change into 100s as the bill is tilted. The strip is woven into the front of the bill. In addition, the new design features an image of a color-shifting bell inside a copper-colored inkwell on the lower front. Officials also retained some older security features, such as portrait watermarks and raised printing. The Geithner bills also cost more to produce than the Paulson version - nearly 12 cents per bill versus 8.5 cents for each Paulson bill.\nAccording to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Web site, more than \"a decade of research and development\" went into the new bill's security features. That increased complexity likely played a role in the recent production errors.\n\"This is the most complex note that the U.S. government has ever put into circulation,\" one Treasury official said. \"As the notes become more sophisticated, the printing becomes more sophisticated.\"\nOnly a portion of the nation's money supply exists in the form of paper money or coins; a larger amount is held in bank accounts and other electronic forms. The Federal Reserve authorizes the creation of paper money based on how much banks request, and the currency is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, then distributed through the regional Federal Reserve system to banks around the country.\nThere was $978 billion in paper currency and coins outstanding as of last week, while the total money supply, using a measure that includes money in checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market mutual funds is about $8.8 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.\nThe government rarely has encountered serious problems in the production of new currency. One other significant delay came in 1987 when the Treasury announced that technical problems had postponed the issuance of the first redesigned American currency in a half century.

        "webpage": "Home > Market Insight, Financial Articles > How Warren Buffett Made His Fortune\nA genius for spotting opportunity and growth potential spark wealth\nBy Editor , Dividend Growth Investor | May 29, 2013, 1:00 am EDT\nMost investors are familiar with Warren Buffett, who is the man in command at Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A,BRK.B). Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time, with a net worth placing him somewhere in the top three richest people in the world. His partner in crime was Charlie Munger, who has worked with him for the past 50 years. While most investors are familiar with the story of Berkshire Hathaway, few seem to know how exactly Buffett made his first millions, that catapulted him to Berkshire Hathaway and the companies and stocks he owns through it.\nBuffett started several investment partnerships in 1956 with approximately $105,000 in investor money, after his former employe, Graham-Newmann investment partnership, was liquidated. Buffett had put an initial $700 of his own money, which ballooned to a stake worth $20 million by the time he liquidated his investment partnership in 1969. The assets under management had grown to $100 million by that time. The Berkshire Hathaway annual letters to investors have been inspired by Buffett's annual and semi-annual letters to his limited partners.\nPer the Buffett Partners agreement, Buffett as the General Partner received a cut of the profits. For every percentage point gain above 6% in a given year, Buffett collected 25% of the gains. The Buffett Partnership Limited (BPL) was essentially a hedge fund, which pooled investor's money and invested them at the discretion of the fund manager. Buffett never had a losing year during the thirteen years he ran the partnership, and he also managed to add new investors along the way. In addition, he reinvested any gains he made as a general partner back into the partnership.\nBuffett invested in the following types of companies at the partnership: generally undervalued securities, work-outs and control situations. Work-outs included stocks whose financial results depend on corporate actions rather than supply and demand factors created by buyers and sellers. Control situations include occasions where BPL either controlled the company or took a sufficiently large position that allowed it to influence policies of the company.\nAfter the BPL was liquidated, Buffett received shares in Berkshire Hathaway, as well as shares in companies which ultimately merged in Berkshire. And the rest is history.\nThe lesson to be learned from this exercise is that in order to become rich, Warren Buffett had a scalable business model, with a substantial amount of leverage. Unfortunately, BPL was mostly a one-man operation, although the turnaround expert he employed with Dempster Mill Manufacturing company is a rare situation where he employed others. He did exchange ideas with several of his value investing friends however.\nBuffett's investment model worked well when he had $100,000 in the partnership, as well as during the time that he had $100 million. The overvalued market in the late 1960's however presented a change to his investment strategy. Buffett had leverage to make a lot of money, simply by being the general partner and earning a good cut on any earnings that the partnership generated, without much downside for himself. On the other hand, Charlie Munger made his initial million by using debt leverage to invest and build real estate.\nThe true genius of Buffett is his complete transformation in the 1970's, when he started purchasing stock in companies with strong competitive advantages. He essentially held those stocks as long-term investments, and in the event where Berkshire acquired entire businesses, he delegated the whole oversight of day to day operations to skilled management.\nThe companies he invested in the 1950's and 1960's represented mostly investments that were one-time producers of substantial gains for BPL. It took Buffett a lot of time to uncover those opportunities, but once they reached full valuation and he sold them, they were no longer producing any benefit for his partnership. He then had to spend more time to find more investments to allocate the now higher cash hoard.\nHowever, the companies and securities that Buffett purchased since the 1970's for Berkshire Hathaway generate recurring cash flow streams to the company. As a result, the effort required to uncover these hidden gems resulted in cash distributions paid to the main holding company for decades. He then used these cash streams to purchase even more cash flow generating assets, which is why I believe that he is a closet dividend investor.\nThe genius of Buffett is that he has been able to uncover undervalued assets, over many different asset classes. Examples include his purchase of silver (SLV) in 1998, real estate investment trusts in 1999, foreign currencies such as the Euro in the early 2000's as well as selling long-dated puts on major market indexes.\nWhile he has a strategy of always looking for undervalued assets, he has been able to make a fortune for Berkshire by being flexible, and avoiding following a \"rigid\" strategy. By training himself to spot opportunities when they arose, he has been able to constantly reinvent himself and make money in different environments.\nFull Disclosure: None\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, ."

        "webpage": "City jobless rate favorable compared to state, nation\nBy Jacob Leibenluft and Tom Sullivan\nWhile the unemployment rate in the New Haven metropolitan area remains below state and national averages, recently released data suggests that the city's labor market is weakening. Between December 2002 and January 2003, the New Haven metropolitan area's unemployment rate increased from 3.8 to 5.0 percent, according to data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics earlier this week. While the city's economy has remained strong throughout the national economic downturn, the new data  -  which reports an increase of over 3,300 unemployed workers  -  show unemployment in the New Haven area at its highest since July 1997. Mark Polzella, acting director of the Regional Workforce Development Board, said many employees using his labor exchange have experienced difficulty finding job openings. \"There's been a steady increase since December,\" Polzella said. \"It's been across all different occupations.\" Polzella said the employees he sees are often skilled and experienced, but need to go through retraining because no jobs are available in their current fields. According to the state Department of Labor, almost every sector of the area's economy saw a decrease in jobs between December and January, the last month for which New Haven employment data is available. The biggest cuts in jobs occurred within the education services and retail trade sectors. State data also showed that the city of New Haven suffered an unemployment increase between December 2002 and January 2003 comparable to the greater metropolitan area, as the city's joblessness rate increased from 5.1 percent to 6.5 percent. But New Haven's unemployment rate remains significantly lower than many other large cities in Connecticut, including Hartford (10.4 percent) and Bridgeport (9.2 percent). In January, the unemployment rate was 5.3 percent in Connecticut and 6.5 percent nationwide. Julio Gonzalez '99, executive assistant to New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr., said the city viewed any economic programs in the context of a long-term program. \"In the short term, I think we're going to do the best job we can in creating good, sustainable growth as quickly as possible,\" Gonzalez said. Gonzalez said the city was focusing on \"hitting economic singles rather than home runs\" by attempting to attract smaller businesses without offering large corporate subsidies. He said the biggest strain on the city would be to maintain city services  -  including policing and child care  -  in difficult economic times. The state reported that 900 state and local government jobs were cut in the New Haven area between December 2002 and January 2003. \"We absolutely understand that like in so many areas of activity, we have to pick up for the state's failed leadership and the federal government's failed leadership,\" Gonzalez said. Yet while the labor market may be weakening in the area, local realtor Nelly Odenwaelder said the real estate market in New Haven remains very strong. H. Pearce Realtors, for which she is a senior vice president, had the best year in its history in 2002. She said moderately priced homes were going quickly with multiple bidders. There was also a very large demand for condominiums and multifamily homes. \"There's not a lot of homes to choose from, no matter what price range you're in,\" Odenwaelder said. State Sen. Majority Leader Martin Looney, who said he has discussed economic policy with DeStefano, said he was confident that the economy would recover from a \"cyclical\" downturn affecting the entire nation. Despite the increase in unemployment, State Rep. William Dyson said he did not think New Haven was moving in a different direction from the rest of the state. \"Clearly, it indicates a trend in which things don't look very well,\" said Dyson, co-chair of the General Assembly's Appropriations Committee. \"I think, though, that it may be bottoming out.\""

        "webpage": "Tax Freedom Day Arrives Later This Year In Maryland\nPosted on 04/04/2008 by Shawn J. Soper BERLIN - With taxes increased on seemingly everything in Maryland in recent months, from an increase in sales tax to gasoline tax to the tax on cigarettes, residents in the state will have to work harder and longer this year to meet their combined tax burden, according to a report released last week by the non-profit Tax Federation. Tax Freedom Day, the point in the year when typical Americans stop working for Uncle Sam and start working for themselves, arrives on April 23 nationwide this year, while Marylanders will reach the milestone five days later on April 28. Calculated annually by the non-profit Tax Foundation, Tax Freedom Day is the point on the calendar when the typical U.S. worker has earned enough to meet his or her federal, state and local tax burden for the year and starts devoting wages to other life essentials such as food, shelter, clothing and recreation.\nTax Freedom Day in the U.S. arrives this year on April 23, or a full week earlier than last year. Maryland residents will reach the milestone on April 30, which puts the state near the end of the finish line. Maryland will be the 43rd state to reach Tax Freedom Day this year. Residents in Alaska were the first, having earned enough to reach their combined tax burden on March 29, while Connecticut residents will not reach the milestone until May 8 this year. The Tax Foundation formula divides the per capita tax burden, the combination of federal, state and local taxes, by the per capita income to arrive at the date workers across the country have earned enough to meet their tax burden and begin to earn money for themselves. For example, Americans in general will work 113 days to meet their tax burden in 2008, while Marylanders will work 121 days.\nIn Maryland, the per capita income projected for 2008 comes in around $49,324 with residents paying about $16,000 in federal and state income tax, meaning the typical worker in the state spends about 33 percent of what he or she makes paying taxes. Consequently, Marylanders make more than the national per capita income, but also pay considerably more in taxes. Maryland is ranked seventh in the country in terms of the typical tax burden. Last year, Maryland was ranked 13th in terms of the typical tax burden, which explains why wage earners in the state will have to work longer this year before they can star paying for other life essentials. Tax Foundation President Scott Hodge, who prepares the annual report, said last week Americans will work 74 days this year to afford their federal taxes and another 39 days to pay state and local taxes. The combined tax burden far outpaces all other major expenditures for typical workers across the country and in Maryland.\n\"Government continues to dominate the American taxpayers' budget,\" said Hodge. \"Americans will spend more on taxes in 2008 than they will spend on food, clothing and housing combined.\"\nThe statistics bear out Hodge's sentiments. For example, it will take the typical American worker another 62 days to earn enough to pay for housing, 52 days for medical care, 30 days for food, and 30 days for transportation. Unfortunately for most wage earners, only 20 days of the year are spent working for recreation and only two days work is devoted to savings.\nAccording to Tax Foundation senior economist Gerald Prante, Tax Freedom Day has been a moving target in recent years. In 2000, the date was reached on May 12, the latest date ever for the milestone. For the next few years, a string of federal and state tax cuts moved the date up by as much as two weeks. For the last three years, per capita incomes and tax burdens increased at around the same rate, creating some stability in Tax Freedom Day. This year, the promise of the federal economic stimulus checks for most wage-earners has nudged the date earlier in the calendar.\n\"Tax Freedom has been a see-saw affair in recent years,\" said Prante. \"After a few years of heading in the wrong direction, it has moved up earlier in the year in 2008.\"\nThe Tax Foundation has tracked the relationship between income and tax burden for decades. When Tax Freedom Day was first calculated at the turn of the 20th century, the typical American worker met his or her tax burden for the entire year in the first month of the year. The earliest Tax Freedom Day was recorded in 1912 when American workers reached the break-even point on Jan. 22."

        "webpage": "Posted on January 11, 2013 by Paul Mirengoff in Federal debt and deficit, Fiscal cliff\nAre we more Greek than Latvian?\nIn a piece called \"Austerity and National Character,\" Anne Applebaum compares the pursuit of austerity in Latvia and Greece. In Latvia, she reports, the Latvian government responded to the crash of 2008 by slashing public spending, firing a third of its civil service, and reducing the salaries of those who remained. GDP fell by 24 percent in two years, but is now growing at more than 5 percent. Meanwhile, the budget deficit has been reduced dramatically.\nAccording to Applebaum, there were no protests or strikes during the two year downturn. In fact, the Latvians reelected the prime minister who imposed austerity. In Greece, of course, things have proceeded differently. Smaller budgets cuts led to strikes and riots. And the country has gone through several governments. The immediate drop in GDP was less than in Latvia (18 percent), but there has been no recovery.\nApplebaum acknowledges differences in the nature of the two countries' austerity program. Latvia hit bureaucrats hard and pensioners less so. And the government made its cuts right away. Greece protected its bureaucrats and made cuts slowly, without ever convincing creditors it was serious. But Applebaum insists that history, culture, and national psychology were also at work in both nations. Latvians are used to hardship and fiercely independent. Greeks, she says, are politically divided and used to being bailed out. Then too, one country is Northern; the other Southern, which may make a psychological difference.\nWith the U.S. massively in debt, we might ask whether, in terms of psychology and character, we are more like Greece or more like Latvia. Once, it would have been clear to me that we are more like Latvia. Now, I suspect we are more like Greece.\nConsider the recent \"fiscal cliff\" episode. A mechanism designed to force Congress to reduce significantly the national debt produced legislation that will increase it. Why? At root, as I argued here, because the public isn't willing to sacrifice anything in the name of debt reduction. The left wants to tax the public more, not in order to reduce the debt but to finance big government. But the public won't accept higher taxes except on the wealthy. That's why Obama had to announce in advance that he would not increase taxes on those making less than $250,000.. . .[T]he president basically lost the game before it began.\nConservatives want entitlement reform and spending cuts. But the public wants Medicare and Social Security to remain as it is. That's why Republicans are so reluctant to propose specific cuts to these programs without Democratic cover which, of course, isn't forthcoming.\nThe public favors spending cuts in the abstract, but politicians reasonably fear that any resulting reduction in services will carry a backlash. And they fear that cuts in defense spending will result in lost jobs and (at least as far as Republican politicians are concerned) reduced national security.\nIn short, we are more Greek than Latvian.\nFortunately, unlike both of these European countries, we are too big to fail for a while  -  perhaps a long while. But if we were more like Latvia, this fact might be less consoling. More from Power Line"

Kip Viscusi, John M. Vernon and Joseph E. Harrington Overview\nThis new edition of the leading text on business and government focuses on the insights economic reasoning can provide in analyzing regulatory and antitrust issues. Departing from the traditional emphasis on institutions, Economics of Regulation and Antitrust asks how economic theory and empirical analyses can illuminate the character of market operation and the role for government action and brings new developments in theory and empirical methodology to bear on these questions.The fourth edition has been substantially revised and updated throughout, with new material added and extended discussion of many topics. Part I, on antitrust, has been given a major revision to reflect advances in economic theory and recent antitrust cases, including the case against Microsoft and the Supreme Court's Kodak decision. Part II, on economic regulation, updates its treatment of the restructuring and deregulation of the telecommunications and electric power industries, and includes an analysis of what went wrong in the California energy market in 2000 and 2001. Part III, on social regulation, now includes increased discussion of risk-risk analysis and extensive changes to its discussion of environmental regulation. The many case studies included provide students not only pertinent insights for today but also the economic tools to analyze the implications of regulations and antitrust policies in the future. The book is suitable for use in a wide range of courses in business, law, and public policy, for undergraduates as well at the graduate level. The structure of the book allows instructors to combine the chapters in various ways according to their needs. Presentation of more advanced material is self-contained. Each chapter concludes with questions and problems.\nDownloadable instructor resources available for this title: file of figures in the book\nW. Kip Viscusi is the George G.

Endorsements\n\"Rather than inundate the reader with institutional details that will soon be out of date, this impressive book provides the tools necessary to analyze current and future regulatory and antitrust issues. Its compelling set of contemporary applications should make it appealing to advanced undergraduates and a useful reference for graduate students.\"\n - Michael Greenstone, 3M Associate Professor of Economics, MIT\n\"How do Viscusi, Harrington, and Vernon do it? Their book keeps getting better and better. It is only 'natural' that they have a monopoly on teaching students, faculty, and policymakers the economics of regulation and antitrust.\"\n - Thomas J. Kniesner, Chair and Krisher Professor, Department of Economics, Syracuse University\n\"This book is by far the most comprehensive and analytically sophisticated treatment of its subject available. The combination of antitrust with government regulation makes the book especially valuable for any course about the effects of government on the private economy.

These analyses are supported with the most up-to-date and comparable data for over 300 indicators covering 32 topics, grouped into eight themes: demographic trends, health, education and knowledge, poverty and insecurity, women's empowerment, environment, economy, and connectivity. Expansion of Global Value Chains in Asian Developing Countries: Automotive Case Study in the Mekong Subregion1 Dec 2013Journals During the past three decades, the development of highly integrated global value chains in which products are supplied, manufactured and distributed across national boundaries have created a new form of division of labour among Asian economies, especially in North-East and South-East Asia. The rapid growth of global value chains has dramatically changed production patterns, international trade and foreign direct investment in the region, with a notable expansion of intraregional trade through multiple border crossings of parts and components. Shifting from quantity to quality: Growth with equality, efficiency, sustainability and dynamism1 Dec 2013Flagship publications and book series Conventional growth strategies have reduced poverty. People now have more access to basic services and more opportunities for mobility and participation. But there are still persistent unmet needs, widening inequalities, and new development challenges such as climate change, intensifying natural disaster and resource depletion. There is a search for growth strategies that better fit a changing economic, social and environmental reality. Technical paper: Sound Practices in Space Technology Applications for Disaster Risk Reduction and Inclusive and Sustainable Development26 Nov 2013Journals Asia-Pacific is the most disaster-prone region of the world. In recent years, it has faced a series of multiple exogenous shocks that transcend geographical boundaries and endanger our communities. The poor and the vulnerable are the ones most affected. Despite the rapid economic growth in the region, many developing countries are increasingly vulnerable to disasters, and the magnitude and frequency of extreme disasters are estimated to rise due to the effects of climate change. This necessitates building resilience of the region to extreme disasters in multidimensional ways. Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2013: Turning the Tide: Towards Inclusive Trade and Development22 Nov 2013Flagship publications and book series The present document is based on the forthcoming Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Report 2013 (henceforth the Report), which is the main substantive document prepared for the third session of the Committee on Trade and Investment. The Report comprises two parts. In the first part, there is a focus on trends and developments in trade in merchandise and commercial services, foreign direct investment flows, performance in trade facilitation, and reliance on preferential policies and trade agreements from an Asia-Pacific perspective. Asia-Pacific Population Journal Volume 2821 Nov 2013JournalsAsia-Pacific Population Journal Volume 28 was released in 2013. A Decade of Building Regional Co-operation in Trade and Investment20 Nov 2013Books ESCAP focuses on a number of areas of economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific. One of these is trade and investment - a vital engine for growth and integration. Recent decades have seen an enormous expansion in trade and investment flows in the Asia-Pacific region. Regional economies are increasingly part of global value chains. This has helped foster the economic dynamism that has lifted many from poverty and spread prosperity more widely. At the same time, however, too many individuals and communities remain excluded from the benefits of trade and investment. Review of Developments in Transport in Asia and the Pacific 20137 Nov 2013Flagship publications and book series While transport has been an essential element in the rapid growth and economic development of Asia and the Pacific, the sector is now at a crossroads more than ever before. Rocketing demand for transport services is putting extreme pressure on existing infrastructure at a time when public budgets are constrained and awareness about the negative externalities of transport activities is growing. The challenge is therefore to ensure that today's transport policies and investments will contribute to a sustainable and inclusive development path for the future. Dealing with challenges for making trade inclusive 1 Nov 2013Working paper series Trade has the potential to contribute to economic growth and to more and better jobs. Whether trade contributes to growth that is inclusive, in the sense that all people can contribute to and benefit from growth triggered by trade, is likely to depend on country specificities including institutional pre-conditions and policies applied in domains other than trade. This paper identifies specific challenges for making trade inclusive and identifies ways for dealing with them.\nThe Vanuatu Cocoa Growers' Association: Inclusive Trade in Rural Smallholder Agriculture 1 Nov 2013Working paper series The Cocoa Grower's Association (CGA) in the Republic of Vanuatu is a fundamental example of how the organization of local cooperatives can make a significant impact and create an environment for inclusive trade. This paper will review a case study of implementing a governing association that coordinates cocoa cooperatives in Vanuatu, and which is focused on organizing the production and trade in the region, as a method to highlight key lessons learned and potential for scalability in furthering inclusive trade goals.

The continuing economic stagnation is taking a toll on consumers. The Commerce Department reported that household income slipped 0.1 percent in August - the first time income has actually fallen in nearly two years.\nThursday, Commerce reported initial claims for unemployment benefits tallied 404,000 - the third consecutive week of 400,000-something filings. Thankfully, layoffs are down from their peak in early 2009. Yet that is little solace to the 22 million unemployed and under-employed Americans who are suffering because job creation is mired about where it was at the depths of the recession. This jobs deficit is leaving our country short half a million new jobs each month.\nThis is due in part to the 23% drop in new businesses, the traditional driver of job creation, from 2007-10. The jobs deficit is further exacerbated by recent federal mandates that increase the cost of having workers on payroll. In that vein, 33 percent of businesses surveyed recently said that they were not hiring new workers because of increased costs associated with the federal health care mandates enacted in March 2010. What had been a promising arc of improvement in the unemployment situation dissipated shortly after enactment of that legislation.\nThe persistent jobs deficit and dearth of strong economic data are crushing disappointments in a normally optimistic nation accustomed to rapid rebounds. The second quarter of 2011's meager 1% GDP growth pales in comparison to the five straight quarters of 7% to 9% GDP growth coming out of the 1981-82 recession.\nThe effort to deficit-spend our way to widespread job growth has failed. But there are other ways to stimulate private sector growth and job creation. This requires that the administration and policymakers adopt a less hostile attitude toward America's private sector.\nAround the time President Lyndon B. Johnson was declaring a War on Poverty in the 1960s, federal, state and local governments began accelerating a veritable War on the Private Sector. The War on the Private Sector was never formally declared, trumpeted in press releases or even intentional. This undeclared war is largely collateral damage in the pursuit of social, environmental and other domestic agendas that spawned and continue to spawn higher taxes, unfunded mandates and regulations that micro-manage employers and impose civil and criminal liabilities.\nWere there laudatory results from some of these initiatives? No doubt. Do the results in all instances warrant the continued costs? Questionable.\nThere are a lot more costs, hassle and peril associated with starting and growing a business today than decades ago. Over two-thirds of the new jobs created today are created by small business employers. A September 2010 Small Business Administration report found that federal regulations cost more than $1.75 trillion in 2008. That report also found that small businesses face a 36 percent higher regulatory cost, per worker, than large companies.\nToday's policymakers should halt the tide of government regulations that are discouraging job growth and understand the challenges private sector employers face in creating new jobs for the workforce.\nOur leaders should also advance and leverage trade opportunities overseas. President Obama has been admirably pro-trade in public remarks but there has been no progress in moving any new free trade agreements to expand exports abroad and create jobs at home. Korea, Columbia and Panama trade deals now await his signature.\nAmerica's private sector job creators need elected leaders to lead and get out of the way.\nElaine L. Chao served as U. S.

REUTERS/Sean Gardne By Nanette Byrnes\n(Reuters) - In a year in which sweeping tax reforms are on the table in several states, Louisiana's Bobby Jindal on Thursday became the first U.S. governor to offer a detailed plan to eliminate his state's income tax, a goal embraced by some conservatives.\nSeen as a potential candidate for national office, the second-term Republican proposed eliminating Louisiana's personal income tax and its corporate franchise tax, which together generated $2.9 billion in tax receipts last year.\nHe called for raising the state sales tax to 5.88 percent from 4 percent, broadening the sales tax to apply to many services, and increasing cigarette taxes to $1.41 from 36 cents per pack. Last year, the state sales tax generated $2.6 billion.\nSimilar plans have been floated by Republicans in Nebraska, Kansas and North Carolina this year. Critics have said that expanding sales taxes hurts working class and poor families who spend more of their income on items subject to the tax.\nDespite a strongly Republican legislature in Louisiana, Jindal's plan faces skepticism in some quarters.\nThe plan \"will not even get out of the House of Representatives\" because of the taxes it would raise, said C.B. Forgotston, a lawyer, political commentator and former legislative aide in Louisiana, who is often critical of Jindal.\nThe plan would need Democratic support to become law and Forgotston said that was unlikely to materialize because the bill does not increase overall revenues for the state.\nJindal's plan would extend the sales tax to some services, but it is expected to exempt a wide range of them, including healthcare, legal, construction, oil and gas services, education and possibly others.\nThe plan was presented to a joint state legislative committee. Jindal first floated the idea of swapping the income tax for a sales tax increase in January. His staff has been hashing out ways to do that for the past two months.\nMany local governments impose fairly high sales taxes, and adding more to the state levy could be troublesome in a state that relies on tourist spending for much of its revenue.\nThe state's economy has been doing relatively well, with unemployment well below national average, which may also make a push for wholesale tax changes a tougher sell.\nThe plan drew praise from anti-tax groups. Patrick Gleason, an official at Washington, D.C.-based Americans for Tax Reform, said the plan would make the state's tax system more efficient and competitive, particularly for businesses.\nIn addition to ending some taxes and increasing others, the plan would make changes to Louisiana's tax system.\nJindal would create a three-judge tax court to hear all tax cases. He also proposes to unify state and local sales tax collection and auditing under one sales tax commission.\nThat would be needed for the state to begin collecting sales tax on online purchases if national legislation permitting that were to be approved in Washington, according to the proposal.\nThe Louisiana legislature will take up the plan in its session starting April 8.\n(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)"

Everson, Former IRS Commissioner and alliantgroup Vice Chairman, Dean Zerbe, former Senior Tax Counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, and Dhaval Jadav, alliantgroup CEO, agree that the proposed tax reform will come of great benefit in a time of increasing demands on tax administration.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mission statement reads as follows: \"Provide America's taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all.\" The Senate Finance Committee Staff has presented a staff discussion tax reform which they believe will allow the IRS to accomplish its mission statement more fairly, efficiently, and effectively.\n\"I welcome anything that can be done to simplify the tax code and improve tax administration. A number of the steps outlined in the staff discussion draft would be of great benefit to individuals, as well as to small and medium size businesses,\" Everson said. \"In addition, Congress has been slow to address the problem of identity theft. It is noteworthy and high time that they tackle this plague, which is straining our tax and financial systems.\"\nReform options include changes to collection and enforcement, the filing process, simplification of the code, and a miscellaneous section comprised of updates and improvements of taxpayers' rights and Tax Court operations.\n\"It is important that the Senate Finance Committee has signaled that it is serious about reform and moving forward in an open and transparent manner. Any staff paper on tax reform that proposes getting rid of AMT as well as the Byzantine PEPs and Pease is off to a good start,\" Zerbe said. \"From my time on the Committee, I've found that staff discussion papers have been a good way to bring forward issues and allow for more engaged and substantive discussions that can possibly lead to legislation. It is good to see the Committee moving from platitudes to particulars as they consider much-needed proposals for reform.\"\nThe Senate Finance Committee stated potential broad principles for reform such as, reducing the cost to taxpayers of complying with the tax code; improving the ability of the IRS to administer the tax law efficiently; reducing tax evasion and inadvertent mistakes; protecting taxpayers from identify theft and privacy invasions; ensuring that all taxpayers are treated fairly and similarly and overall providing better service. \"As alliantgroup works with thousands of small and medium size companies across the country, I've seen firsthand that the tax code and tax administration need to work better for these businesses. It is refreshing to see that in today's staff paper, there is recognition of the costs and burdens of tax complexity and administration,\" Jadav said. alliantgroup hopes that the Committee will particularly listen closely to small and medium businesses as they move forward with their deliberations to address these issues.\nalliantgroup is the nation's premier provider of specialty tax services.

Deciphering the Whys of Ukrainian Tax Compliance\nSPS Working Papers\nBERENSON, Marc P.\nUkraine; Tax Compliance; Political Culture; Citizenship; Trust; Poland; Russia\nIn gauging how well residents in the new post-communist states such as Ukraine become true citizens, who are capable of fulfilling their obligations to their governments, it is necessary to measure how compliant the populace is on an individuallevel with respect to taxes. While there is a lack of data on taxpayer compliance rates in Ukraine in comparison to its neighbours, results from a series of unique Taxpayer Compliance Attitudinal Surveys designed and carried out by this author in 2004 and 2005 illustrate how Poles, Russians and Ukrainians view paying their dues. The data indicates not only that the Polish polity is far more willing in its attitude towards paying taxes than the Russian and Ukrainian polities are, but that Russians respond to the state with greater fear of coercion while Ukrainians, showing the lowest levels of support for obeying the law, react to state efforts to increase tax compliance with less fear and little trust. The Ukrainian survey also provides for additional comparative analysis of those in the different regions of the country. While respondents from the four main regions of the country - East, West, Centre and South - do not differ when in comes to overall support for obeying tax laws, the rationale for doing so does differ in particular between the East and the West. Moreover, what is also striking is the difference in support for tax compliance as well as the rationale for doing so between Catholic and non-Catholic Ukrainians. The important question, then, becomes \"why?\" By linking issues of political culture to legacies of state-society trust, the paper shows that there is a distinct \"Catholic effect,\" which while not strong, shows that Catholic Ukrainians seem to react to a greater extent to state efforts to increase tax compliance more out of their levels of trust in the state than do non-Catholics. Hence, political culture is shown to have some impact in the realm of paying one's dues to the state."

        "webpage": "Expecting a Tax Refund? Expect to Wait\nYou've probably gotten used to stories of government bureaucracy and inefficiency. But now, waffling among lawmakers will hit everyone where it hurts: in the wallet. Elected representatives have decided this year to play chicken with the alternative minimum tax (AMT), a controversial tax provision that was created to make sure that all taxpayers paid at least some taxes regardless of deductions or other tax breaks. The original law included an exemption from the AMT that was high enough to tax only those with relatively high incomes. Because that exemption was never indexed for inflation, however, the AMT now threatens to capture middle-class taxpayers. For years, Congress has passed temporary increases to the exemption amount -- often at the last minute -- to mitigate the impact of the AMT. Beyond the 11th hourThis year, lawmakers seem determined not to resolve the AMT issue until the last possible moment. With four weeks left in the year, Congress hasn't yet passed a so-called \"AMT patch\" to give taxpayers their much-expected relief. Instead, a more extensive proposal has called for outright repeal of the AMT along with a general cut in the corporate tax rate. In exchange, high-bracket tax rates would rise, and certain perceived loopholes would be closed, including the 15% rate on carried interest that benefits managers of private-equity firms like Blackstone Group (NYSE: BX ) and Fortress Investment (NYSE: FIG ) . That proposal is unlikely to pass, but it has framed the debate in a way that makes it harder to get a plain AMT patch through Congress. Without a patch, you might end up owing as much as $4,000 to $5,000 more than you might have expected. Yet the problem has gone beyond merely who pays the AMT. The Treasury has said that because lawmakers are waiting until the last minute to make significant changes, the IRS may not be able to process early tax returns, which taxpayers typically file if they're expecting large refunds. What that means is that even if the AMT has absolutely no impact on your taxes, you might end up having to pay for AMT gridlock in the form of a delay on your refund -- money that no one disputes is owed to you. What to doIf there's a chance that you owe AMT, you should think about its potential effects now. The most likely reason you'll have to pay AMT is if you have certain types of deductions that don't get counted for AMT purposes, such as real estate and state income taxes. In general, it often pays to pay those taxes early in order to pull a potential tax deduction into the current year. But if you're stuck paying AMT, it actually makes sense to wait, since you won't be able to claim that deduction by paying early. The problem, obviously, is that if you're right on the fringe of the tax right now, your decision may hinge on whether that patch gets passed. As for tax refunds, there's probably not a lot you can do this year. For 2008, however, let this serve as a reminder that you're better off keeping more of your paycheck for yourself than letting the IRS have an interest-free loan that gets repaid in your tax refund. By adjusting your withholding and estimated tax payments to get you closer to the amount you actually owe, you won't have to worry about whether the IRS will pay your refund on time. You'll already have that money to use, however and whenever you wish. And to end on a positive note, you can probably expect this to be just the first in a series of similar yet more extensive deliberations to come in future years. With many previous tax cuts set to expire in coming years, there are no guarantees that they'll be extended. A massive tax increase might result simply from government inaction. Unfortunately, the one thing that people from every political viewpoint can agree on is that it's easy for lawmakers to get stuck in gridlock.

People are worrying again that developments in global population trends, food supply, natural resource availability and climate change raise the question as to whether Malthus was right after all. The Age of Aging explores a unique phenomenon for mankind and, therefore, one that takes us into uncharted territory. Low birth rates and rising life expectancy are leading to rapid aging and a stagnation or fall in the number of people of working age in Western societies. Japan is in pole position but will be joined soon by other Western countries, and some emerging markets including China. The book examines the economic effects of aging, the main proposals for addressing the implications, and how aging societies will affect family and social structures, and the type of environment in which the baby-boomers' children will grow up.\nThe contrast between the expected old age bulge in Western nations and the youth bulge in developing countries has important implications for globalization, and for immigration in Western countries - two topics already characterized by rising discontent or opposition. But we have to find ways of making both globalization and immigration work for all, for fear that failure may lead us down much darker paths. Aging also brings new challenges for the world to address in two sensitive areas, the politicization of religion and the management of international security. Governments and global institutions will have to take greater responsibilities to ensure that public policy responses are appropriate and measured.\nThe challenges arising within aging societies, and the demographic contrasts between Western and developing countries make for a fractious world - one that is line with the much-debated 'decline of the West'. The book doesn't flinch from recognizing the ways in which this could become more visible, but also asserts that we can address demographic change effectively if governments and strengthened international institutions are permitted a larger role in managing change.\nGeorge Magnus\nEconomist, and author George Magnus is an independent economist, author and speaker.

        "webpage": "hide Future of state estate taxes hangs on U.S. \"fiscal cliff\"\nWednesday, December 26, 2012 1:50 p.m. CST\nBy Nanette Byrnes\n(Reuters) - Falling off the \"fiscal cliff\" is a bad thing, right?\nNot necessarily for some state governments that could begin collecting more in estate taxes on wealth left to heirs if the United States goes over the \"cliff,\" allowing sharp tax increases and federal spending cuts to take effect in January.\nIn an example of federal and state tax law interaction that gets little notice on Capitol Hill, 30 states next year could collect $3 billion more in estate taxes if Congress and President Barack Obama do not act soon, estimated the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank.\nThe reason? The federal estate tax would return with a vengeance and so would a federal credit system that shares a portion of it with the 30 states. They had been getting their cut of this tax revenue stream until the early 2000s. That was when the credit system for payment of state estate tax went away due to tax cuts enacted under former President George W. Bush.\nWith the return of the credit system next year as part of the \"cliff,\" states such as Florida, Colorado and Texas - which have not collected estate tax since 2004 - could resume doing so. California Governor Jerry Brown has already begun to add the anticipated estate tax revenue into his plans, including $45 million of it in his 2012-2013 revised budget.\nBrown may or may not be jumping the gun.\nCLOUDY CLIFF AHEAD\nThe outlook on the \"fiscal cliff\" coming up at year-end is uncertain. Democratic President Barack Obama has said he hopes for a last-minute deal to avert it. That would need to get done soon, with Congress just now coming back from its holiday break.\nChances of an agreement became more remote last week after Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives fumbled their own legislative attempt to prevent the fiscal jolt that economists say could trigger a recession.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner abruptly adjourned the chamber for the holidays after failing to gather the votes from within his own party to pass legislation he and other Republicans had drafted, after walking out of negotiations with Obama.\nWeeks of inconclusive political drama over the \"cliff\" have focused largely on individual income tax rates and spending on federal programs such Medicare and Social Security, but many tax issues are also involved, including the estate tax.\nAt the moment, under laws signed a decade ago by Bush, the estate tax is applied to inherited assets at a rate of 35 percent after a $5 million exemption. That means a deceased person can pass on an inheritance of up to $5 million before any tax applies. Inherited wealth passed to a spouse or a federally recognized charity is generally not taxed.\nObama wants to raise the rate to 45 percent after a $3.5 million exemption. Republicans have called for complete repeal of the estate tax, which they call the \"death tax,\" though Boehner earlier this month called for freezing the estate tax at its present level. It was difficult to determine what the Republicans want after last week's events in the House.\nSTATES STAND TO GAIN\nIf Congress and Obama do not act by December 31, numerous Bush-era tax laws will expire, including the one on estate taxes. That would mean the estate tax rate will shoot up next year to the pre-Bush levels of 55 percent after a $1 million exemption.\nIt would also mean that for the first time in years, a portion of that estate tax would go to the states, through the return of the credit system.\nUnder that old law, estates paying the tax could get a credit against their federal tax bill for state estate tax payments of up to 16 percent of the estate's value.\nIf the fiscal cliff were allowed to take hold unaltered by Washington, 30 states would again automatically begin getting their share of federal estate taxes. The state laws are generally written so the state estate tax amounts are calculated under a formula based on the amount of the federal credit.\nThis would help states that have struggled with lower tax revenues since the 2007-2009 financial crisis and resulting recession, according to research by the Pew Center on the States, though painful federal spending cut backs would also hurt the states.\n(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Cynthia Osterman)"

        "webpage": "Taking data analysis to a new plateau: Narrative Science raises $11.5M\nBy Cale Guthrie Weissman\nToday hundreds of financial technology companies and executives have descended upon New York to attend the Finovate conference, which gives choice financial technology startups a chance to demo their products in front of colleagues and press alike.\nUp until now the demos have been focused on ways to streamline personal finances in the digital and mobile age. But, every once in a while there's a company that is doing something so far different you can't help but notice. One such startup is Narrative Science, a company that focuses on a unique form of data analysis and which announced today an $11.5 million Series C round of funding.\nNarrative Science provides a platform called Quill that translates raw data into tangible narratives. That sounds bizarre, and it is. Instead of providing endless amounts of charts and spreadsheets, Quill uses artificial intelligence algorithms to correctly identify germane data points in a set to create easily understood written reports. The three-year-old company's CTO Kris Hammond explains the platform's process as simply \"mining data for meaning and insight.\"\nThe software must be pretty powerful too; the CIA's investment arm In-Q-Tel has invested in the venture. No word on whether the CIA's sister agency, NSA, has inserted a backdoor into the code. If it did I doubt the CIA would tell us, but I digress.\nWhat makes Narrative Science so fascinating is its forward thinking. Hammond explained to me that he doesn't see the company as merely a software maker. Instead, it is reconfiguring what people expect from machines. Currently, humans interact with machines using a language and technical configuration that is highly complex and obtuse. Further, the output these machines provide directly mirrors this. This is to say that those who work with data analysis systems must know high-level mathematics and logical structures to create meaningful results. And, when interacting with these systems, humans expect a similarly technical output of charts and highfalutin graphs.\nHammond wants this interaction to be a thing of the past, and thinks machines should be able to respond at a human level. He envisions a world where all people \"can understand more because the system knows more.\" With this in mind, he envisions a future where data spreadsheets are on par with time punchcards: an archaic relic.\nUsing this rationale, Hammond said the idea of being acquired is something he doesn't envision for the company; he wants everyone in the world to be able to use his software. At the same time, Narrative Science's technology does sound like something a government agency or large data-oriented company would love to have for its very own.\nAccording to Hammond, the company is using this new funding to work further on the Quill program. In addition, it plans to build out its sales and marketing (the company currently has about 50 employees).\nRight now, Quill is operating solely as a software-as-a-service (SaaS), but the company is working to release the software on its own soon. While Hammond wouldn't put a date on the release, I'm sure the data will be informative.\n[Image courtesy x-ray delta one]"

        "webpage": "Labor participation lowest since 1978 by Steve Hargreaves @hargreavesCNN September 6, 2013: 3:01 PM ET The official U.S. unemployment rate is falling, but that's not necessarily a good thing. That's because the slice of Americans involved in the labor force has shrunk to a level not seen in 35 years. The labor force participation rate -- the percentage of people over 16 who either have a job or are actively searching for one -- fell to 63.2% in August. The last time it was that low was in August of 1978. In the latter half of the 20th century, the rate rose steadily for decades as more women were entering the workforce, eventually peaking at 67.3% in 2000. But the number has been on the decline ever since -- a trend that was accelerated by the Great Recession. Economist say there are several reasons for the decline, including the retirement of the baby boomers and fewer students who also work. But the main reason for its recent fall is a lack of good jobs. \"We know there's a lot of hardworking people that want to be productive, we just don't have work for them to do,\" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Schierholz said the labor force participation rate would be going down anyway as the baby boomers retire. But she said that since the recession, between two-thirds and three-quarters of the drop can be attributed to the lousy job market. \"We're operating way below potential,\" she said. Related: Stuck in a part time job So why is a low rate of labor participation a problem? There are now 90.5 million Americas who don't work and are not counted as part of the labor force. This excludes kids under the age of 16 and non civilians such as those in the military or in prison, but includes just about everyone else. Why the jobs report was not such good news Many of them are either retired or are high school or college students, according to the Labor Department. But the other 40 million or so aren't trying to find work for a variety of reasons -- they might be rich, they might stay home with kids or relatives, they might be disabled, or they might simply have given up looking for a job. Whatever the reason, the fact that just over 63% of the population is engaged in the workforce is problematic. It means that a smaller chunk of the population is paying for promised entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare. And if a smaller share of the country is working, it will also act as a drag on economic growth. \"We're not getting the economic growth or the tax payments that were expected when these promises were made,\" said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities. \"It's disturbing, and it's going to force choices. We can't just continue doing what we're doing.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published September 6, 2013: 3:01 PM ET Comments Social Surge - What's Trending"

The first two essays deal specifically with Kalecki's analysis of the relationship between pricing and distribution and its development by the Kaleckians. In the first of them, his formulation is reconstructed and compared with a growth and distribution model elaborated by his followers, especially Rowthorn, Dutt, and Taylor. Then, some questionings that this theory has received (concerning the relation between competition and distribution, the relation between short and long term determination, and some issues of aggregation) are discussed. Finally, alternative interpretations of the model suggested by these questionings are analyzed. The second essay can be seen as a further development of the topic of the first, focusing on the political dimension of the relationship between pricing and distribution. It investigates the concept of class struggle in Kalecki's writings. First, his inclusion of trade unions' strength as one of the determining elements of the degree of monopoly is examined, taking into consideration Lerner's formulation of the latter. Then, the limits of this understanding of class struggle are pointed out from the standpoint of Marx's conceptual distinction between labor and labor-power. Finally, a reinterpretation of Kalecki's \"Political aspects of full employment\" is provided, indicating the broader conception of class struggle implicit in this work and its usefulness to a better understanding of capital-labor conflicts in contemporary capitalism. After this engagement with the Kaleckian tradition, the third essay shifts the focus toward Marxian economics. It offers an interpretation of the Great Recession based on Foley's circuit of capital model. According to this interpretation the contractionary effects of financialization were compensated by the housing bubble, from the mid-1990s to the early 2006. The busting of the bubble, then, was followed by the crisis. The model is calibrated with reference to quarterly data from the Flow of Funds Accounts, from 1960 to 1995. The interaction of financialization and the housing bubble, from 1996 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2009, is examined by simulating a baseline version of the model and imposing observed shocks.\nFields of expertiseMacroeconomics, Political Economy, History of Economic Thought, Economic History E-mail:"

Critics point out that interest rates are already at historic lows, and they say it is unlikely that further cuts will spur significant growth.\n\nThe Fed's plan is to print more money and use it to buy government securities. That would put more dollars into circulation in the hopes of reducing long-term interest rates paid by businesses and consumers who borrow money.\n\nEquities trader Cort Gwon of FBN Securities in New York supports the plan.\n\n\"It will bring a lot more liquidity into the markets, which will help financial firms, banks, lending,\" Gwon said. \"It will help the general economy really get back to growth.\"\n\nA large volume of money in circulation could lower interest rates much the same way a large number of empty apartments on the market would make it easier for prospective tenants to bargain for lower rents.\n\nLower long-term interest rates would make it easier for people to borrow the money they need to buy homes. And lower rates would enable businesses to buy equipment to expand their operations and create new jobs.\n\nJoe Gagnon of the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics calls the proposal \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\n\"The Fed needs to do something like this,\" he said. \"I actually think this is less than they should be doing.\"\n\nGagnon says the Federal Reserve has two jobs - to maximize employment and to keep prices stable. And he says the Fed's plan will help on both fronts. He says inflation is so low now that the economy could fall into a damaging downward spiral of declining prices and wages called deflation.\n\nBut critics, like Gerald Hanweck of George Mason University, warn that a flood of new money into the economy will more likely make the value of the dollar decline, sparking inflation.\n\n\"It does not seem to have a big benefit, but at the same time it has some costs,\" he said.\n\nHanweck says the Federal Reserve's action could do the opposite of what officials intend. That is because rapidly rising prices would make lenders worry that they would be repaid in future dollars that would be less valuable due to inflation. That would prompt banks to raise interest rates to protect their investments. And higher interest rates could stall the economic recovery."

        "webpage": "Foreword by Lawrence W. Reed\nBy Jack McHugh, published on Oct. 18, 2007\nThe budget deal struck by the Michigan Legislature in the wee hours of Oct. 1, 2007, represents both bad policy and bad timing. The Legislature's limited reforms were dwarfed by tax hikes of historic dimensions  -  an 11.5 percent increase in the state's income tax and a new services-related 6 percent sales tax that will make Michigan a uniquely uncompetitive location for many firms.\nThis projected $1.358 billion tax hike for fiscal 2007-2008 would be difficult in a robust climate, but it is much worse in a state that's in the grip of a one-state recession. Michigan's tax base of people and businesses is beginning to crumble, as evidenced by these sobering facts:\nThe unemployment rate, at 7.5 percent, is 60 percent higher than the national average. According to United Van Lines statistics, Michigan was tied with North Dakota for the highest outbound migration rate in the nation last year.\nRelative to the rest of the nation, the state's per-capita income has been in free fall since 2000. It is now an astonishing 7.8 percent below the national average.\nHome values are plummeting as foreclosures soar to their highest level in recent memory.\nGovernment statistics show that in 2001, Michigan's average private-sector wage was 9 percent below the average state government wage. Today, it's about 18 percent below. We're becoming a poor state with well-off public servants.\nMichigan's state and local tax burden is estimated to rise to 12th in the country under the new taxes, according to the nonprofit Tax Foundation in Washington, D.C. (Note: On Aug. 7, 2008, the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation released its newest State-Local Tax Burden Ranking of the 50 states. This report included a change in the methodology used to compute and rank tax burdens which led to a significant drop in the position Michigan held in Tax Foundation rankings  -  from 14th to 27th among the 50 states.)\nAdd in the \"taxing\" effect of Michigan's high regulatory burden and the perception of an unfriendly labor climate, and you have a toxic brew that drives people and businesses away. The extension of the sales tax to certain services is a guaranteed job-killer that will hit small businesses particularly hard. Those are the very businesses that create most of the new jobs; many of them are mobile enough to simply leave the state and escape the tax completely. For those that remain, paperwork blizzards, legal headaches and accounting nightmares await. It should not surprise anyone that Michiganians aren't happy. By a 2-1 margin in a poll taken before the tax hikes materialized, likely Michigan voters indicated they preferred more spending cuts than tax increases to balance the state budget. Since passage of the new taxes, 10 of the legislators who voted for them  -  five Democrats and five Republicans  -  have become targets of recall election campaigns, and a broad-based coalition of business groups may put repeal of the taxes on the ballot if the Legislature doesn't reverse the damage.\nWill higher taxes truly put the fiscal 2008 budget into the black? If people line up like sheep to be sheared, maybe. More likely, the dynamic disincentive effects of a bigger tax burden will accelerate the decline in Michigan's ability to produce new tax revenues. The Legislature will almost certainly be grappling with yet another shortfall soon.\nLegislators and the governor can do the responsible thing and repeal the tax increases. If they don't, it is possible the people will do that for them through a ballot initiative. Either way, the issue of spending reductions and meaningful reform of state government must be revisited  -  the sooner the better.\nThe Mackinac Center for Public Policy has offered many suggestions over the years to help resolve the state's fiscal problems. With the folly of the midnight budget deal now apparent to almost everyone, the state's immediate need is for spending cuts and cost-saving reforms in the current fiscal year, thus eliminating the need for the tax hikes just passed. This document recommends specific state spending reductions, clearing the way for urgently needed transformational reforms and government restructuring. The time for gimmicks, Band-Aids, distractions and punitive tax hikes is over. The moment for real remedies is long overdue.\nWill the governor and Legislature muster the courage to do what's right by undoing what's wrong? Our state's future hangs in the balance.\nReplacing Michigan's New Taxes With Budget Reductions: Curing $1.358 Billion in Overspending\nWith 55 Specific Recommendations\nForeword by Lawrence W.

Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, GDP grew by 0.7 per cent and during 2011 as a whole GDP grew by 0.8 per cent. So over the four quarters of 2011, GDP grew by an average of 0.2 per cent. This compares with an average quarterly growth during 2010 of 0.5 per cent for 2010 as a whole compared to 2009.\nWhereas real GDP fell slightly in the final quarter of 2011, by 0.2 per cent compared with the previous quarter, employment and hours both rose. The number of people in employment rose by 60,000 taking the employment rate from 70.2 per cent in the third quarter to 70.3 per cent in the fourth. Similarly total hours worked increased by 0.4 per cent between the latest two quarters.\nDuring the recession, employment fell by less than might be expected given the scale of the fall in output. By the middle of 2009, output was more than 7 per cent below its pre-recession peak, while over the same period, employment fell by around 2 per cent, and total hours worked by less than 4 per cent. A decline in full time and permanent employment, with a corresponding rise in part time and temporary employment, may suggest that firms have been 'hoarding' labour - using the greater flexibility offered by reducing hours worked rather than the number of employees themselves. It may be easier to adjust hours worked in response to changes in demand and output, rather than making employees redundant and then having to recruit new workers at a later date. There are also benefits to retaining existing staff in terms of an established skill base and accumulated experience.\nDuring the subsequent recovery, the labour market has similarly recovered only modestly, with employment rising by less than in previous recoveries from recession. Notwithstanding the movements in the latest quarter, by the end of 2011, the drop in GDP from the pre-recession peak was still nearly 4 per cent, similar to the overall fall in total weekly hours, while employment was only about 1.5 per cent.\nEarnings growth compared to inflation\nWeakening earnings growth in 2011 Q4\nAnother way in which the labour market has adjusted to the recession has been through slower earnings growth, which in December was 2.0 per cent for the whole economy. By contrast consumer prices rose by 4.2 per cent in the same period.\nEarnings have been growing more slowly than price inflation for much of the past four years, and this has been a key influence on the subdued economic recovery seen so far. However the fall in real earnings has diminished slightly in the last few months as the rate of consumer price inflation has fallen back somewhat. Consumer price inflation fell further to 3.6 per cent in January as the impact of the rise in the rate of VAT to 20 per cent in January 2011 drops out of the annual inflation figure.\nGross Domestic Product (ABMI): chained volume measures, seasonally adjusted, Office for National Statistics.\nTotal employment level (MGRZ): Labour Force Survey, all those aged 16 and over, seasonally adjusted, Office for National Statistics.

        "webpage": "News Posted April 15, 2014\nYellen: Mega-banks might need to hold more capital\nThe Fed chief says that current rules on how much capital banks must hold to protect against losses don't address all threats. By Martin CrutsingerThe Associated Press Share\nWASHINGTON  -  The Federal Reserve may be about to turn more aggressive in its regulation of the financial system.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen suggested Tuesday that current regulatory rules might not be enough to prevent the kind of risk-taking that triggered the 2008 financial crisis and nearly toppled the entire banking system.\nJANET YELLEN Search photos available for purchase:\nShe said the largest U.S. banks may need to hold additional capital to withstand periods of financial stress. Non-banks with deep reaches into the financial system might also need to meet tougher rules, she said. Such firms range from money market mutual funds to private equity and hedge funds.\nYellen told a banking conference in Atlanta that current rules on how much capital banks must hold to protect against losses don't address all threats. The Fed's staff is considering what further measures might be needed, she said.\nAt the same time, Yellen said the Fed would review the likely effects of imposing stricter rules on banks. Banks and their advocates have warned that further tightening bank regulation would lead to reduced lending to businesses and financial institutions and could slow economic growth.\nAnalysts said Yellen's message echoed remarks that Daniel Tarullo, a Fed governor and the board's point person on bank regulatory issues, has made in the past. They said it could be a sign that the Fed under Yellen will take a more assertive stance toward bank regulation.\nIn her speech, Yellen said further actions to address risks, such as requiring firms to hold more capital, would likely apply only to the largest, most complex banks. But she suggested that other requirements could be applied more broadly to medium-size banks and non-bank financial institutions.\nKaren Shaw Petrou, an analyst who heads Federal Financial Analytics in Washington, said Yellen also appeared to be signaling a desire to ensure that in tightening rules for big banks, regulators don't just drive risky behavior into less regulated areas of the financial system. These areas are often called the shadow banking system.\n\"The threat is if all you do is regulate the big banks, the risk will move to the non-banks,\" Petrou said. \"Yellen is signaling that the Fed will seek to address that problem.\"\nBert Ely, an independent banking consultant in Alexandria, Va., said Yellen was indicating that the Fed plans to address the risk that parts of the financial system will exploit gaps in the rules.\n\"The more requirements you put on the highly regulated banks, the greater is the incentive to find ways around the tougher rules,\" Ely said.\nIn 2007 and 2008, risk-taking in a corner of shadow banking known as subprime mortgages spread to other areas of the system and eventually pushed the country into the worst recession since the Great Depression.\nIn her remarks, Yellen said regulators must focus on ways to prevent another financial crisis. She spoke via video to a financial markets conference sponsored by the Fed's Atlanta regional bank.\n\"In 2007 and 2008, short-term creditors ran from firms such as Northern Rock, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and from money market mutual funds and asset-backed commercial paper programs,\" she said. \"Together, these runs were the primary engine of a financial crisis from which the United States and the global economy have yet to fully recover.\"\nYellen referred to a 2010 study by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The study, in assessing the long-term economic effects of imposing stricter capital and liquidity requirements on banks that operate globally, concluded that such changes would produce a net economic benefit.\n\"While it would be a mistake to give undue weight to any one study, this study provides some support for the view that there might be room for stronger capital and liquidity standards for large banks than have been adopted so far,\" she said.\nLast week, regulators approved requirements that will make the eight largest U.S. banks add up to $68 billion in capital to comply with rules designed to ensure that the banks could withstand severe losses.\nThe so-called leverage ratio approved by the Fed and the other regulators will require the largest banks to maintain capital well above the global minimum levels against all assets on their books, not just those judged to be the riskiest."

        "webpage": "First Person: The deficit danger\nBy Allister Heath\nIt is difficult to know what is most depressing about the economy. Jobs are being slashed and homes being repossessed. So it is understandable that the catastrophic black hole at the heart of our public finances is not receiving the attention it deserves. Yet as the economy shrinks, Britain is about to suffer its worst budget deficit since the Second World War. The gap between government revenues and spending could soar to \u00a3132bn, equivalent to a crippling 9.1 per cent of GDP, in the 2009 financial year. This would be higher even than the \u00a3118bn forecast still officially clung to by Gordon Brown, and the highest as a share of GDP for over six decades. In his defence, Brown claims everybody is suffering from huge deficits as a result of the global downturn and that it is unfair to blame him. But the truth is that our fiscal prospects are much grimmer than anybody else's. Under Brown's stewardship, Britain's public finances became structurally unsound during the boom years, which means we are now having to borrow more as a share of our economy than any other rich nation. In fact, the deficit could all too easily hit 10 per cent of GDP in the coming financial year, according to Michael Saunders, economist at banking giant Citigroup. That is the kind of deficit that used to be the preserve only of tin-pot dictatorships. At no time over the past 30 years have America, Germany, France or Japan ever done this badly. And for all the talk that Brown is deliberately racking up a deficit to inject extra demand into the economy, his new-found Keynesianism is largely accidental, an after-the-event rationalisation of years of irresponsible spending.\nSo far, Brown has got away with selling gilts to pay for his deficit. Since the end of 2003, foreign investors financed 72 per cent of Brown's borrowing, often accepting low yields in return. Many of these are now nursing huge losses thanks to the collapse in sterling; growing numbers will no longer touch British assets with a bargepole. All of which helps to explain why Brown will soon embrace quantitative easing  -  the technical phrase for printing more money. While many believe this would boost the economy, such a policy would also come in very handy for a government facing the greatest peacetime budgetary crisis in Britain's history. You have been warned.\nSource URL:"

        "webpage": "South Carolina Credit Union Goes After Phishers\nMay 17, 2013 \u2022 Reprints A South Carolina credit union is taking what legal experts say is a rare legal approach to combat phishing by filing a civil lawsuit and winning a court order to serve subpoenas on Internet service providers and phone companies related to the case without waiting for a pretrial conference.\nThe $687 million AllSouth FCU in Columbia, S.C., filed a civil lawsuit last month in U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against unknown perpetrators that gained access to at least 125 members' accounts, according to court documents.\nThe lawsuit names \"John Does\" and \"Jane Does\" as defendants charged with infringing upon AllSouth's trademark and violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\nThe credit union, which has more than 20 locations and 100,000 members, is seeking an immediate injunction against the fraudsters and treble damages, which are mandatory under RICO statutes and entitle the court to award triple the amount of actual damages.\nIn effort to identify and locate criminals who launched a SMS phishing scam in early April, a U.S. District Court judge has issued an order granting expedited discovery, allowing AllSouth's legal team to serve subpoenas on third-party communications providers.\nUnlike a criminal case, a civil lawsuit allows different methods of discovering evidence, which is likely why AllSouth has adopted the tactic. AllSouth officials declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\"We have nothing further to add,\" said Audrey Brown, the credit union's vice president of marketing.\nAccording to court records, the fraudsters sent phishing text messages by obtaining a list of AT&T customer names with South Carolina's (803) area code. Recipients were told their account had limited access or restricted access and were instructed to call a toll-free telephone number.\nCallers were greeted with an automated recording stating, \"Welcome to AllSouth Federal Credit Union,\" and prompted to provide personal information such as account, Social Security and driver's license numbers, which perpetrators used to log on to AllSouth's online banking system and transfer money out of victims' accounts.\nThe exact number of victims is yet to be determined, but at least 125 credit union members reported to AllSouth that they revealed personal data during the phishing scam, according to court documents.\nIt's rare for judges in civil cases to grant an expedited discovery order to issue subpoenas to third-party service providers, according to legal experts, but this is not the first time a financial institution has utilized the tactic in a phishing case.\nRecords of communications providers are given extra protection by the \"Stored Communications Act\" portion of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, but the laws have gotten murky with increasing technology such as social media and cloud storage.\n\"It's my impression that civil discovery requests to third-party service providers for the content of communication under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act are very unusual and may not be allowed by the statute,\" Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in email to Credit Union Times.\nThe court order granted to AllSouth states that the motion for expedited discovery was allowed pursuant to Rule 26(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In 2006, a district court in Nebraska granted a motion to allow First National of Nebraska to conduct immediate discovery on non-party ISPs for the limited purpose of identifying and locating unknown defendants that conducted a phishing scam.\nTime is of the essence, according to AllSouth's motion, because \"the information sought from some of the third parties through the proposed discovery is in electronic format, and, therefore, it is reasonable to expect that such information will eventually be purged by the third-parties in accordance with a data retention policy. Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if discovery is not permitted, as the defendants will likely never be identified, the number of victims will increase, and AllSouth's reputation will continue to be damaged.\" Meanwhile, financial institutions must remain diligent, a consumer advocate advises. \"Banks and credit unions need to maintain their security protocols at the highest levels and also need to educate their consumers about identity theft,\" said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program director with the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a national non-profit consumer advocacy organization.\nGood for them!\ngoogle-5c4698f651634a8092e3e64b8b894af9"

One thing they're not likely to hear about is the $1.08 trillion elephant on the quad  -  our nation's student debt crisis.\nThat is how much U.S. households are estimated to owe in student loans, twice as much as in 2007. In fact, student debt now exceeds credit card debt, putting millions of families at risk of bankruptcy. Forty percent of households headed by someone under the age of 35 that are saddled with student debt, unable to buy homes, raise families and secure their futures. This doesn't just hold back individuals  -  it holds back our economic recovery.\nMeanwhile, Congress manufactures false debt crises instead of solving this very real one.\nEnter Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who intuitively understands the urgency and scale of the crisis. Indeed, Warren is not just a longtime student of bankruptcy in the United States, but someone who understands what it means for a family to be at risk of losing everything. As she writes in her new book, \"A Fighting Chance,\" the rules are such that a sudden event  -  divorce, illness, unemployment  -  can pull the rug out from under anyone. \"A turn here, a turn there, and my life might have been very different, too,\" she writes.\nRigged against the middle class\nWarren first came to Washington to battle a system that has long been rigged against the middle class, where working families' voices get overpowered by well-funded lobbyists who hold elected officials by the pocket. In a 2009 interview with Michael Moore, she said, \"You can't buy a toaster in America that has a one in five chance of exploding. But you can buy a mortgage that has a one in five chance of exploding, and they don't even have to tell you about it ... We have consumer protection for everything you touch, taste, smell, feel ... But there is no equivalent for credit cards, for mortgages. There's nothing.\"\nThat's why she successfully fought to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the first new pro-consumer, pro-people agency Washington has seen in decades.\nThe senator has since been deploying her compassionate, creative firepower to combat the student debt crisis. Last July, Congress allowed interest rates on federal student loans to double. Warren fought against the compromise solution  -  flawed legislation that tied interest rates for new loans to the market, but left those with existing loans out to dry. As she noted at the time, the federal government stood to profit from all those IOUs, to the tune of $200 billion over the next 10 years, an arrangement that Warren rightly called \"obscene.\"\nShe lost that round, but refused to quit. Earlier this year, she proposed legislation that would allow individuals with existing student loans to refinance at the same lower rates that were set last summer for new loans. Warren's plan would also enact the so-called \"Buffett rule,\" which would establish a minimum tax on income over $1 million and would allocate the projected $50 billion in revenue exclusively for refinancing student debt. \"Do we invest in students or millionaires?\" she asked in a speech at the Center for American Progress.\nGetting government out of the loan business\nSadly  -  and predictably  -  the resounding answer from the right is \"millionaires.\" The conservative Heritage Foundation has not only criticized the \"Buffett rule\" but also called for the federal government to get out of the college loan business, a step that would leave the middle class out in the cold when it comes to pursuing higher education. Meanwhile, Rep. Paul Ryan's latest budget would slash $90 billion from Pell grants and start charging students interest while still in school.\nWe should be doing more\nThe United States could and should do much more to help middle- and low-income families afford postsecondary education  -  especially at a time when our economic growth depends on an educated workforce. As I've argued before, we could make public college or advanced training free to qualified students for about $30 billion annually  -  less, for instance, than the $483 billion in defense discretionary spending that Ryan's budget would add over the next 10 years.\nAnd people are squarely in Warren's corner. Americans of both parties overwhelmingly favor keeping loan rates at their current rate or lowering them. Students continue to protest the status quo, and in Warren they now have a fierce, fearless advocate.\nCommencement speakers usually call on their audiences to use their youth and idealism to tackle the nation's most urgent problems. This year, commencement speakers from across the country should address the problem located on the very campuses that will host them, challenging students, lawmakers and college administrators to ensure that higher education remains an engine for growth, not a dead end of debt.\n| Opinion - The Record\n| Opinion: Guest Writers"

Plus, a look at why China Merchants Bank has a distinct advantage over its competitors.\nInvestors have long sought to take advantage of the growth in China.\nMany believe the spate of China-focused exchange traded funds serve them well. Perhaps they represent a lot of progress since Richard Nixon's 1972 visit and famous handshake with Mao Zedong, but in reality, the current brand of ETFs do not serve investors particularly well.\nIn particular, purchases of shares in Chinese companies for bundling in ETFs purchased by foreigners are constrained to \"H\" shares, so named because they are a separate class of stock trading not on the Shanghai Stock Exchange nor the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, but on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or SEHK. The bifurcation of investors into separate classes - following suit with human history's miserable track record regarding class systems - undermines investor interests by exposing them to subordinate dividend rights, excessive currency fluctuations, and in some notable instances, inferior stock performance. But the worm has turned with a recent filing from KraneShares, to offer a suite of US-listed ETFs that provide investors access to so-called \"A\" shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. How this came to pass, surprisingly, is related to a trip I took last week to the Ernst & Young World Entrepreneur of the Year (WEOY) Awards.\nWhile there, I had the opportunity to meet with and discuss Chinese investments with Dr. Weihua Ma, CEO and President of China Merchants Bank (). China Merchants Bank is the only Chinese bank that is not state-owned, which gives it a distinct advantage over its competitors.\nTo wit: Under Dr. Ma's leadership, CMB has grown from 30 employees in 1999 to over 50,000 employees, with 900 branches and assets approaching $500 billion (USD) as of the end of 2012.\nWhat accounts for the bank's success? Through a translator, Dr. Ma said, \"China Merchants Bank has always had a Western mentality to doing business, and uses government resources in a limited manner and only when they can really be leveraged to help growth.\" A bit inscrutable perhaps as a strategy, but nonetheless successful.\nCMB's scale in China allows for expansion into new markets. As US investors evaluate gaining exposure to growing companies like CMB, they have a variety of choices. ETFs are one way to gain exposure to the world's second largest economy. While historically iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (), SPDR S&P China () and iShares MSCI Hong Kong Index () have been popular choices, newcomer KraneShares offers an innovative approach by taking the Chinese government's 12th Five Year Plan and investing in the companies within the focus industries. KraneShares hopes to launch next month.\nFamed investor Jim Rogers suggested investors take a close look at the most recent five-year plan published in 2011 by the National People's Congress. There are lots of goals, such as addressing income inequality, upgrading the social welfare system, and reducing energy consumption. However, some of the smaller metrics are even more telling, such as a $449 billion investment to grow the high-speed rail network from its current 5,800 miles to 11,200 miles by 2015. By contrast, here in the US - and depending on your definition - there are no actual high-speed rail systems, but the US High Speed Rail Association has a plan to complete a 17,00- mile high speed rail system by 2030. Counsels Rogers, \"If I were you, I'd get out there and do some studying, because whatever the government decides it wants to do, it will probably make a lot of people rich in those sectors.\"\nFollow Oliver Pursche on Twitter: @opursche, and see Gary Goldberg Financial Services for more. < Previous\nFXI,GXC,EWH"

This was stated by Finance Minister Ibrahim Al-Assaf while opening the Private Sector Middle East Conference held at the Council of Saudi Chambers (CSC) on Tuesday.Four key organizations have joined under one umbrella to organize this global economic event, which is considered the first of its kind in the Middle East. They include the Ministry of Finance, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) aside from the CSC.Abdullah Al-Mobty, chairman of the CSC; Dimitris Tsitsiragos, vice president for Europe, Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa regions, IFC; and Min Zhu, deputy managing director, IMF, also addressed the packed gathering of local and international delegates.Speaking on the economic challenges facing the region and the private sector's contribution, the minister said despite the implementation of economic reforms and support given for the private sector in the region, the role of the private sector, was still modest and the volume of investments small and not up to the expectations.\"Many countries have adopted policies to support the participation of the public and private sectors, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which enjoy great care and benefits from their respective countries.Al-Assaf said the private sector in the Kingdom had played a significant role in its national development. \"It has contributed SR700 billion, 58 percent of the GDP, toward various businesses.Last year, he said, the private sector provided jobs for some 250,000 people, totaling its strength of employees to one million. Private sector has invested around SR314 billion in the Kingdom, the minister added.About incentives, the minister said the Kingdom has created a conducive climate for successful partnership between the public and private sectors. \"We are introducing judicial reforms, new mortgage law has come into force and lands are being provided for industrial developments,\" he noted.Commending the unprecedented enthusiasm displayed by the Middle East countries to promote private sector participation, Zhu said there was a need for stability in its growth rate.He pointed out that there is a strong need for more private sector participation in the region to trigger economic developments. The Kingdom has made remarkable progress in attracting private sector participation which is proven by its economic stability.Encouraging private sector would create more job opportunities for the people, he said, adding that such active private sector involvement would attract investments from the region as well as from other countries on the globe.About the Kingdom's growth, he said it had dropped to 3.6 percent this year from 5.1 in the previous year. \"The cause of this decrease is due to slower output of oil. \"We expect this to increase next year to 4.4 percent with increased oil production,\" he added.The Kingdom's inflation remains in check at 3.6 percent, while the government budget still remains surplus of 9.6 percent during the current year, he added.He also pointed out that 60 percent of the Kingdom's population is between 14 and 65 years of age. The main challenge is to find job opportunities for this group,\" he noted, adding that there are plenty of resources in the region to attract local and foreign investments.Tsitsiragos stated that the investors in the Gulf region play an important role in the development of retail , infrastructure and communications.The first scientific session on the role of macroeconomic and financial policies in private sector development was chaired by Hamad Al-Bazie, vice minister of finance, Ministry of Finance.The other speakers included Alfred Kammer, deputy director, Middle East and Central Asia Department, IMF; Abdulmohsen Al-Fares, CEO of Alinma Bank; Michael Grifferty, president of The Gulf Bond and Sukuk Association (GBSA); and Talat Z.

Under the blueprint hashed out by the central bank in June 2011, the end of stimulus would have gone something like this: First, the Federal Reserve would stop reinvesting principal payments into longer-term Treasury bonds. Next, it would raise short-term rates. Finally, it would sell off its mortgage-backed securities over a three- to five-year period. A lot has changed since then, William Dudley noted in prepared remarks before the Japan Society. Various policies have expanded the Fed's holdings by $500 billion over the past two years, and with that larger balance sheet comes heightened risks. Currently, the Fed is engaged in a third round of so-called \"quantitative easing,\" a policy through which the central bank buys bonds in an effort to lower long-term interest rates. The Fed buys about $85 billion in Treasuries and mortgage backed securities each month, and it's unclear when this program will end. The central bank has said it wants to see substantial improvement in the job market before it winds down its stimulus efforts. Recently, Fed officials have stressed that they're prepared to adjust the pace of their bond purchases in either direction, depending on the economy. Dudley reiterated that point Tuesday. \"Because the outlook is uncertain, I cannot be sure which way -- up or down -- the next change will be,\" he said. Stocks rose to their highest level of the day after Dudley's remarks were released. Related: Fed sticks with stimulus So if the current exit strategy is stale, what would a revised plan look like? Dudley suggested the Fed should consider holding on to its mortgage-backed securities until they reach maturity. Instead of selling them, it may be best to to allow those securities \"to run off passively over time,\" he said, nothing that selling the securities could lead to a sharp increase in long-term interest rates. Selling mortgage backed securities at lower prices in the future could also saddle the Federal Reserve with losses -- an issue likely to cause a public relations nightmare. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, for example, has called the potential for future losses a \"recipe for political problems.\" Related: Fed officials: Don't worry if we lose money The central bank needs be careful not to freak out the market when it eventually starts to unwind. \"There is a risk that market participants could overreact to any move in the process of normalization,\" Dudley said. The Fed needs to \"think long and hard\" about how to it can respond flexibility to changing conditions \"in a way that is not disruptive to the economy,\" he added.

Medicaid also has the right to sue families in probate court to \"claw-back\" funds spent on care.\nJust one recent example involved John Pittas, a 47-year old restaurant owner who was sued by a nursing home company for $93,000 in expenses incurred by his mother over a six-month period after she was denied Medicaid eligibility.\n\"The court finding even granted discretion to the nursing home company to seek payment from any family members it wished to pursue,\" says Orestis.\nTo avoid a financial catastrophe, he says families should consider these options:\nKnow your and your family's health-care rights as a veteran. Veterans who have honorably served their country should take advantage of their VA benefits - not only for their well-being, but also for their family's health. Additional programs that may apply to family members include the VA Civilian Health and Medical Program (CHAMPVA), a comprehensive health-care program in which the VA shares the cost of covered services and supplies for eligible beneficiaries; the spina bifida health-care benefits program for certain Korea and Vietnam veterans' birth children; and TRICARE, another health-care program serving uniformed service members, retirees and their families.\nYou can convert your life insurance policy for long-term care. There is $27.2 trillion worth of in-force life insurance policies in the United States, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners - that's triple the amount of home equity today! Rather than cancel or drop a policy to save on premiums when faced with long-term care needs, you can use it to pay for home care, assisted-living or nursing home expenses. \"I've been lobbying state legislatures to make the public aware of their legal right to use this option,\" says Orestis, CEO of Life Care Funding, (). Seniors can sell their policy for 30 to 60 percent of its death benefit value and put the money into an irrevocable, tax-free fund designated specifically for their care.\nDon't be so quick to attempt to qualify for Medicaid. Many people who need significant long-term health care can't afford it, so they drop life insurance policies that they've been carrying for years in order to qualify for Medicaid. Families often turn to Medicaid to pay for nursing home care, but it comes with many restrictions, including choice of facilities. In a situation where one spouse is healthy and the other is not, the spouse living independently will also face restrictions on the amount of assets he or she can retain, for instance, a maximum $2,898.00 for monthly maintenance.\n[Chris Orestis, nationally known senior health-care advocate, expert, and author is CEO of Life Care Funding, (), which created the model for converting life insurance policies into protected Long- Term Care Benefit funds. His company has been providing care benefits to policy holders since 2007. A former life insurance industry lobbyist with a background in longterm care issues, he created the model to provide an option for middle-class people who are not wealthy enough to pay for long-term care, and not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.] Go to top"

Without a change, the city would build up a $3.9 billion deficit over 10 years, mainly because of the cost of providing pension and health-care benefits to retirees, he said.\nMalhotra was the first of five witnesses the city said it will present at the trial. Lawyers for retired and current city workers have attacked the decision by a state-appointed emergency manager to put Detroit into bankruptcy, where creditors can't try to seize assets or file suits that disrupt reorganization efforts.\nIn opening statements yesterday, lawyers for the retirees and city workers said Detroit hasn't met the standard set out in Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to remain under court protection.\nThe law says the city must show that it's insolvent, that it's entitled under state law to file for bankruptcy, that it tried to negotiate with creditors or was unable to do so, and that it intends to file a plan to adjust its debts.\nThe emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, was never serious about trying to fix the city's finances outside of bankruptcy, said Jennifer K. Green, an attorney for a city pension system fighting the Chapter 9 case.\nLast year, state officials conspired with Jones Day, the law firm that Orr hired to file the bankruptcy, to create a new emergency manager law and use it to file for bankruptcy, giving Detroit leverage over unions and retirees, she said.\n\"It really was a foregone conclusion,\" Green said.\nDetroit has a \"mountain of evidence\" showing it's entitled to federal bankruptcy protection, Bruce Bennett of Jones Day, a lawyer for the city, said at the beginning of the trial, which is scheduled to continue through Oct. 29.

By Anthony Sampson; Soros on Soros by George Soros John Wiley, pounds 14.99 ANTHONY SAMPSON\nIn an age when everyone bows down to the market-place, they naturally look for a prophet there. But George Soros seeks to prophesy in two very separate fields, as both billionaire investor and philanthropist.This book takes the form of long interviews with an American banker and a German journalist, who ask admiring questions: \"Well, George, You've been an incredible odyssey...\" But, as the title suggests, it is really a dialogue with himself, in which he can be very candid.\nHe admits to having had a messianic complex; he feels himself larger than life, defying the law of gravity; he is still amazed at his accomplishments. But he does not really face up, I think, to the contradiction between his two roles.\nHis story is certainly remarkable. As a young Jewish boy in Hungary he was 14 when the Nazis took over; after the Communists came in, he left for England, went to the LSE where he studied with Karl Popper and then to New York where he soon became a brilliant fund manager.\nBy the early Eighties he was very rich, but self-effacing and little known outside the financial world. I got to know him then, fascinated by his questioning and wide-ranging intellect. In the middle of a financial crisis he would be walking across Hyde Park, discussing Latin American or South African politics with constant curiosity.\nHe was already interested in the idea of setting up foundations to help to bring about an \"Open Society\" in Russia and Eastern Europe. When Communism collapsed, he spent more and more of his fortune on promoting freedom and education in those countries.\nHe decided that he needed to be famous to get access to top people like George Bush and Margaret Thatcher, so he rapidly opened up to the media. Ironically, he did not become really famous (as he points out) until he made a billion dollars from the collapse of sterling. Now his high profile enables him to move markets, with all the dangers that implies.\nToday he relishes his international exposure and he sees his own development as linked to the fate of the world. \"My whole life has been one long effort to integrate the various facets of my existence ... An open society is one in which a person like me can live and prosper.\" He sees no contradiction between his money-making from speculation, and his mission to establish institutions to protect democracy in countries in turmoil; and he now invests in the same countries where he has foundations.\nBut Soros's two sides are more in conflict, I think, than this book chooses to explore. For in this global market-place the process of speculation which made his fortune is always liable to destabilise national policies and commitments.\nIt remains doubtful whether Russia can survive the ruthless incursions of the \"robber capitalists\" investing in Mafia-like activities. But Soros, as he explains, could not resist joining them: \"here was an embryonic financial market with tremendous upside potential\".\nSoros describes his intense disappointment, after he was financing his foundations in Eastern Europe, when he looked behind him to find that no western government was following him. In 1989 he pressed for a new Marshall Plan to support democracy in Eastern Europe, which he hoped Mrs Thatcher would support. He should have known that she was instinctively hostile to any form of foreign aid. And the global market which had enabled Soros to make his billions was also making it harder for any government to commit itself to any such long-term assistance.\nSoros has a genuine sensitivity to global dangers which comes from his own experiences. He is now rightly concerned that the West, as well as the former Soviet empire, is threatened with disintegration because it takes its open society for granted and is not prepared to make sacrifices to maintain it. But this book suggests that he may have become too absorbed in his own personality to see the problem altogether clearly. More about:"

        "webpage": "WASHINGTON AND LOS ANGELES  -  The nation's biggest banks are regaining their health, but some need to replenish their coffers to withstand any new difficulties, the government said in an upbeat report Thursday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's highly anticipated \"stress tests\" found that 10 of the 19 largest banks needed to bolster their capital by a combined $75 billion. Most of that must be raised by two banks with a large California presence -- Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. -- highlighting the role of the state's housing market meltdown in the recession.\n\nOverall, however, federal officials and industry experts said the results of the stress tests were another sign that the economy was getting closer to the road to recovery.\n\nFor The Record Los Angeles Times Saturday, May 09, 2009 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 National Desk 1 inches; 51 words Type of Material: Correction Bank 'stress tests': In some editions Friday, a headline with an article in Section A about a Federal Reserve report on the nation's biggest banks said the government found that 10 of the 19 largest banks needed to raise a total of $75 million in capital. The figure is $75 billion.\n\nEconomist Sung Won Sohn summarized the stress-test results as \"a sigh of relief.\"\n\n\"The results are not as bad as feared,\" said Sohn, a professor at Cal State Channel Islands and a former Wells Fargo executive. \"The economic conditions are improving and the economic trough is not too far away.\"\n\nBert Ely, a consultant to banks, was less optimistic, saying the economy had not reached bottom and big losses on commercial real estate loans were only beginning to burn holes on balance sheets.\n\n\"It's really going to be a question of what happens to credit quality,\" Ely said. \"I'm not convinced that the stress tests have fully addressed the potential problems out there. If things take a bad turn, all the concerns could come back again.\"\n\nThe stress tests were designed to assess the health of the major U.S. banks and determine whether they could handle a deepening of the recession. The process included a stark assessment of the cost of the financial crisis: Under a worse-case scenario -- not a worst-case scenario, as critics wanted -- the total losses of the 19 banks from mid-2007 to the end of 2010 could reach nearly $950 billion.\n\nThe tests showed that the banks would need very little new federal bailout money but would still need to boost capital through stock offerings, asset sales or other means.\n\nBank of America needs to raise $33.9 billion, more than any other bank, followed by Wells Fargo with $13.7 billion and GMAC with $11.5 billion.\n\nThe release of the data set off a flurry of announcements by banks of their plans to raise the needed money. BofA and Wells Fargo said they would sell new stock to the public.\n\nThe 10 banks have until June 8 to develop detailed plans and five more months to raise capital privately before the government would step in with more bailout money.\n\n\"They've got their marching orders. . . . They're not going to sit around,\" said Brian Bethune, chief financial economist at IHS Global Insight, who believes that the financial system has recovered enough that the banks can raise the $75 billion privately. \"It's in their own interest now from a competitive point of view to satisfy this requirement as soon as possible.\"\n\nThat's because nine of their big competitors have no need to increase their capital, and among those rivals is the nation's largest bank by total assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nBanking executives were relieved that the stress tests were over, though they didn't necessarily agree with the government's assessments.\n\n\"This stress test was probably more critical for us than others,\" Vikram Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. \"I'm happy that this part of the process is done and that this chapter is behind us.\"\n\nCitigroup's chief financial officer, Ned Kelly, called the process \"a milestone for us and for the industry.\"\n\nThe Fed led the stress-test process, which applied to U.S. banks with total assets of more than $100 billion. Geithner said the results \"bring a level of disclosure that goes well beyond what you typically see.\"\n\n\"I think it will . . . make it easier for banks to ultimately be in a position to repay the government,\" he said.\n\nThe banks had made significant improvements in their balance sheets in the first three months of this year, the Treasury chief said. The stress tests found that the banks would have needed $185 billion in additional capital at the end of 2008, but that figure had been trimmed by more than half.\n\nUnder the worse-case scenario, the 19 banks would face total losses of $599.2 billion for 2009 and 2010, with the biggest estimated losses on first mortgages, at $102.3 billion, and second mortgages, at $83.2 billion, as the housing market continues to suffer.\n\nThe release of the stress-test results clears the way for the banking system to start to return to normal after eight months of upheaval."

In this respect it was very clear that the King III Code formed the benchmark of corporate governance for these companies.\n\"It spells out clearly what the shareholder role is, what the role of the board is and what the role of the management is,\" said Mondi.\nIn addition both state-owned enterprises (SOE) and development finance institutions, such as the Industrial Development Corporation and the Development Bank of South Africa, were subject to Acts of Parliament, and ultimately accountable to the legislature.\nOne of the biggest risks was the \"blurring of responsibility\" between the shareholder's role and that of the institution \"leading to confusion and competition at managerial level and almost a failure of an SOE to effect the mandate that is given by parliament\" he said.\nState-led growth\nMondi pointed to recent developments at SAA. The airline has been under severe commercial strain after a fall-out between Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba and its former board, followed by a set of poor financial results.\n\"We've seen how companies like SAA for example are battling these issues and in the process leading to institutional confusion and uncertainty within a company that should be focusing on its mandate, in this case [transporting] people cheaper, efficiently and on time,\" he said.\nHe also raised concerns over the appointment of securocrats to institutions such as the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), which is currently undergoing restructuring. Last year Mo Shaik, formerly head of the security services, was appointed to head the bank's international division, which is to be relaunched as a DBSA subsidiary. Finance Mininster Pravin Gordhan defended Shaik's appointment, stating at the time that Shaik proved the best candidate following a rigorous selection process.\nThere were some good lessons to be learnt from the Chinese model, he said, but governance risks threatened to undermine the \"very bold and positive\" steps government was taking to drive economic growth and development.\nThe emphasis on state-led growth presented positive opportunities for South Africa in a number of respects including as an infrastructure provider to southern Africa. Localisation requirements by government on large projects had also encouraged the entrance of multinational companies, which had invested locally in South Africa.\nDA takes Gigaba to task over SAA imbroglio\nSAA and the R550-million bailout\nState-owned enterprises given extra slices of the budget pie\n'State-owned entities must be more efficient'\nstate-owned entities\nAfrican Frontiers Forum"

        "webpage": "Note to Washington: About half of VC-backed company founders are immigrants\nMark Heesen November 15, 2006 7:12 AM\nFor those who live and work in Silicon Valley, the positive impact of foreign nationals on the region is obvious. The area has long been a magnet for the best and brightest students, entrepreneurs and professionals from all over the world to thrive. Just look at some of the companies that were founded by these individuals and you start to get a sense as to their value  -  to our lives and to our economy.\nImagine if Jerry Yang had stayed in Taiwan and had not been able to immigrate to the US as a child? Or Andy Grove remained in Hungary? Or Sergey Brin was now living in Russia? Companies that have changed the way we live, work and think would certainly not be headquartered here  -  and maybe wouldn't exist at all.\nThe venture capital community has long understood the importance of making sure the cream of crop continues to come to the US to build businesses. In the past, based on anecdotes, we had estimated that at least half of our member's portfolio companies had at least one immigrant founder. But no one ever made a serious attempt to quantify it until now.\nToday the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) is releasing a study that reveals some astounding numbers regarding the national prevalence and the contributions of immigrant entrepreneurs to our economic health  -  and highlights again the urgent need to fix our immigration policies before the US loses its global innovation leadership.\nNVCA has been involved for years in the effort to reform H1-B visa and green card policies. But given the increased rancor of the immigration debate this year, the focus on illegal immigration, and the strong sense within the venture community that these issues impact US competitiveness we decided we needed hard data to really make the case. The study speaks for itself in terms of the dramatic impact immigrant entrepreneurs have had on the US economy.\nIn terms of positive impact, the numbers are impressive:\n -  Companies founded by immigrants and initially backed by venture capital account for more than $500 billion of total U.S. market capitalization.\n -  Over the past 15 years, in fact, immigrants have started 25 percent of all the venture-backed companies that have gone public.\n -  Immigrant-founded, venture-backed public companies today employ an estimated 220,000 people in the United States and over 400,000 people globally\nQuality may be more important than quantity, however, as these companies  -  concentrated largely in cutting edge sectors  -  tend to generate white collar jobs that pay high salaries, which in turn help to create wealth and raise living standards.\nWe also looked to test the premise that half of the current venture-backed companies had at least one immigrant founder. We surveyed these companies and garnered more than 340 responses from around the country. It appears our intuition was in the ballpark. Of those responding to the survey, nearly half (47 percent) of the founders of private companies were immigrants, and almost two-thirds (66 percent) of the immigrant have already started or intend to start more companies in the United States.\nWhile the successes have been great for our industry and the US economy, they also suggest an alarming reality: The US is essentially stunting its own growth by not reforming its immigration system with the proper urgency.\nResponses to the NVCA survey bear this out:\n -  More than 2/3 of immigrant entrepreneurs agreed with the notion that U.S. immigration policy has made it more difficult than in the past to start a business in America.\n -  Sixty-six percent of respondents who use H-1B visas indicated that \"current U.S. immigration laws affecting skilled professionals harm American competitiveness.\"\n -  Among companies who use H-1B visas, nearly 40 percent said the lack of H-1B visas has \"negatively impacted [their] company when competing against other firms globally.\"\n -  One-third of the respondents indicated that the lack of H-1B visas had influenced their firm's decision to place more personnel in facilities abroad.\nFortunately, it's not too late. According to the research, 95 percent of the immigrant founders in private companies would still start their companies in the United States if given the choice today. By raising the H-1B cap, among other measures, we can ensure that America continues to draw the world's best and brightest minds  -  and thus share in the wealth that they create as crucial participants in the US innovation economy.\nTo view the entire report  -  including methodology, etc.  -  please go to"

        "webpage": "Books and a Blanket Obama Budget Targets Millionaires, Replaces Sequester Cuts\nBy: Reuters Email Posted: Wed 9:16 AM, Apr 10, 2013\nBy: Reuters Email Home\n/ Article (Reuters)- The White House on Wednesday proposed a budget that would sharply trim the U.S. deficit over three years by forcing millionaires to pay more in taxes and enacting spending cuts that replace the \"sequester\" reductions that went into place last month.\nPresident Barack Obama's fiscal 2014 budget blueprint ensures that those making $1 million a year or more would have to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes, after gifts to charity, officials said.\nThat increase, along with spending cuts and a 28 percent cap on tax deductions for high earners, would bring the U.S. budget deficit down to 2.8 percent of GDP by 2016 and 1.7 percent by 2023, senior administration officials told reporters. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office in February projected the U.S. deficit to be 5.3 percent of GDP this year.\nObama is due to release his full budget at 11:15 a.m. EDT (1515 GMT) and to make remarks at that time.\nThe president's budget stands little chance of being enacted into law and is meant to serve largely as a negotiating tool with Republicans in Congress, who have outlined budget proposals of their own.\nSenior administration officials said that, in spite of Republican leaders' resistance to tax increases, they hoped Obama's plan could lead to a deficit reduction accord.\n\"There continue to be people who are on the Republican side ... in the Senate at least, who are saying things that would give you some hope that there is a path to a deal,\" a senior administration official told reporters.\nThe president's advisers said the budget proposal would achieve $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years. Added to the $2.5 trillion in deficit cuts from past efforts, the total would be above the $4 trillion reduction both Republicans and the White House have said would be an acceptable goal.\nRepublicans quickly dismissed Obama's proposal, particularly his deficit reduction plans, which they described as not serious.\n\"When you cut through the spin and get to the facts, it looks like there's less than $600 billion worth of (deficit) reduction in there - and that's over a decade - all of it coming from tax increases,\" said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.\n\"In other words, it's not a serious plan. For the most part, just another left-wing wish list,\" he said.\nLOOKING FOR A DEAL\nThe president is breaking from the tradition of using the largely symbolic budget release to outline his ideal tax and spending proposals. Instead, he is trying to relaunch talks to resolve a long-running fiscal battle with his Capitol Hill adversaries.\nTo do so, Obama is offering a concession that has enraged many of his supporters: adopting a less generous measure of inflation to calculate cost-of-living increases for the beneficiaries of many federal programs. One result would be diminished benefits for most recipients of the popular Social Security retirement program.\nAlthough Obama has pledged to shield some of the most vulnerable beneficiaries, the proposal has drawn strong opposition from Democrats and groups representing labor and the elderly.\nAt the same time, his budget proposal faces seemingly insurmountable opposition from Republican leaders, who reject any new tax revenues.\nObama's hope is to build a coalition of lawmakers willing to compromise, although most observers see that as unlikely. He has invited 12 Republicans to dinner at the White House on Wednesday in an effort to soften resistance.\n\"The question is, are Republicans going to be willing to come to us to do the serious thing that they say is so important in terms of reducing our deficit,\" a senior administration official said in a conference call with reporters the day before the budget release.\nBoth sides are so dug in that they were unable to prevent some $85 billion in across-the-board \"sequestration cuts\" from going into effect March 1.\nObama's budget proposal would replace those cuts with his original deficit reduction proposal from December. That offer included $930 billion in spending reductions and some $580 billion in tax revenues.\nThe president's budget includes spending on policy priorities such as infrastructure and early childhood education. He would pay for those programs with additional taxes and the elimination of some tax breaks for the well-off.\nThe budget also includes a 10 percent tax credit for small businesses that raise wages or hire new workers.\nObama's budget is a clear contrast with a rival blueprint put forward by Representative Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee and potential 2016 presidential candidate.\n\"You can invest in the middle class, create jobs, and reduce our deficits,\" a senior administration official said. \"We don't have to choose between deficits as far as the eye can see and the sort of austerity that's in the Paul Ryan budget.\"\nRyan's bill aims to balance the budget in 10 years through deep cuts to healthcare and social programs while lowering tax rates."

To deliver this, we need to give our firms access to new sources of funding, such as by opening UK bond markets to medium-sized businesses.\n\"The government's \u00a31bn of business finance partnerships will also help stimulate investment in these companies.\"\nIn an effort to meet the needs of SMEs, the CBI is also proposing the independent financial advisers (IFAs) programme.\nTo encourage small and medium-sized businesses, the UK's top business lobbying organisation recommends creation of a mid-sized bond market in the country, provision of short-term tax incentives, and sensitisation of non-bank finance sources in the country.\n\"This is as much a problem of demand as supply. Firms need independent help and support to locate the finance that's right for them. So we must cut through the red tape and complexity surrounding non-bank finance to make it more easily understood by small and mid-sized businesses, which often lack the resources of a larger company.\n\"We also need to make it simpler for alternative lenders to judge the credit worthiness of SMEs,\" Cridland added."

We have one bond issued as a private placement with TD Bank - and it was competitively bid - but in most instances our best pricing is in the public markets,\" he says. In August, Inova completed a $400 million offering in the capital markets. Magenheimer says $300 million of that financing will go toward phase two of the south patient tower and a portion of phase three - a renovation of the existing campus slated for 2015.\n\"We are confident that Inova will have the necessary capital to complete all three phrases of the project. There's always a balance needed between borrowing at competitive rates and retaining some internal liquidity,\" he says. \"One should first look at internally generated funds for project financing. However, we think the public markets in general will offer the most competitive cost of capital, provided an organization has to have the financial performance to access those markets,\" Magenheimer notes.\nThough Shapiro and Magenheimer agree that commercial lenders tend to be better for short-term capital rather than long-term capital, such institutions are, nevertheless, viable lenders. Banks generally lend by directly purchasing tax-exempt debt with fixed or variable interest rates. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 widened the definition of bank-qualified debt, which encouraged approximately $70 billion of direct tax-exempt loans in 2009 and 2010, according to The Bond Buyer.\nAlthough the temporary debt provisions under the ARRA ended with 2010, banks have continued to actively lend to healthcare organizations. \"We're seeing a lot more activity, but the conversations are different,\" says John Hesselmann, specialized industries executive for Bank of America's Global Commercial Banking. 1"

        "webpage": "Protecting Afghan Opium Fields, Bribing Taliban\nObama Allies Want New Tax. Despite the fact that 36 per cent of income tax already goes to national defense\nBy Paul Joseph Watson\nGlobal Research, November 20, 2009\nPrison Planet 20 November 2009\nRegion: USA\nIn-depth Report: AFGHANISTAN\nNot content with savaging American taxpayers with two huge new financial burdens during an economic recession, in the form of health care reform and cap and trade, close allies of Barack Obama have proposed a new war surtax that will force Americans to foot the bill for the cost of protecting opium fields in Afghanistan, paying off drug lords, and bribing the Taliban.\nWarning that the cost of occupying Afghanistan is a threat to the Democrats' plan to overhaul health care, lawmakers have announced their plan to make Americans pay an additional war tax that will be taken directly from their income, never mind the fact that around 36 per cent of federal taxes already go to paying for national defense.\n\"Regardless of whether one favors the war or not, if it is to be fought, it ought to be paid for,\" the lawmakers, all prominent Democratic allies of Obama, said in a joint statement on the \"Share The Sacrifice Act of 2010 (PDF),\" reports AFP.\nThe move is being led by the appropriately named House Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey, Representative John Murtha, who chairs that panel's defense subcommittee; and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank.\nThe tax would apply to anyone earning as little as $22,600 per year in 2011.\nThe proposal is described as \"heavily symbolic\" with little chance of passing, but it once again illustrates the hypocrisy of an administration that swept to power on the promise of \"change\" to the Neo-Con imperial agenda and a resolve to reduce U.S. military involvement overseas. In reality, there are more troops in Iraq and Afghanistan now under Obama that at any time during the Bush administration.\nAt the height of the Bush administration's 2007 \"surge\" in Iraq, there were 26,000 US troops in Afghanistan and 160,000 in Iraq, a total of 186,000.\nAccording to DoD figures cited by The Washington Post last month, there are now around 189,000 and rising deployed in total. There are now 68,000 troops in Afghanistan, over double the amount deployed there when Bush left office. What precisely would this extra tax be used to pay for? Namely, bribing the Taliban, paying off CIA drug lords, and protecting heroin-producing opium fields.\nNumerous reports over the past two weeks have confirmed that the U.S. military is paying off the Taliban with bags of gold to prevent them from attacking vehicle convoys, proving that there is no real \"war\" in Afghanistan, merely a business agreement that allows the occupiers to continue their lucrative control of record opium exports while they finalize construction of dozens of new military bases from which to launch new wars.\nThe Afghan opium trade has exploded since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, following a lull after the Taliban had imposed a crackdown. According to the U.N., the drug trade is now worth $65 billion. Afghanistan produces 92 per cent of the world's opium, with the equivalent of at least 3,500 tonnes leaving the country each year.\nThis racket is secured by drug kingpins like the brother of disputed president Hamid Karzai. As a New York Times report revealed last month, Ahmed Wali Karzai, a Mafia-like figure who expanded his influence over the drug trade with the aid of U.S. efforts to eliminate his competitors, is on the CIA payroll.\nAs Professor Michel Chossudovsky has highlighted in a series of essays, the explosion of opium production after the invasion was about the CIA's drive to restore the lucrative Golden Crescent opium trade that was in place during the time when the Agency were funding the Mujahideen rebels to fight the Soviets, and flood the streets of America and Britain with cheap heroin, destroying lives while making obscene profits.\nAny war surtax will merely go straight to maintaining the agenda that Obama inherited from Bush, the continued looting of Afghanistan under the pretext of a \"war on terror\" that, as revelations about bribing the Taliban prove, doesn't even exist.

        "webpage": "Ryan Budget Represents the Height of Irresponsibility\nby Marc H. Morial\n\"Affluent Americans would do quite well. But for tens of millions of others, the Ryan plan is a path to more adversity.\" Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\nIn the same week that we marked the anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and learned that 7.1 million Americans had enrolled in the Affordable Care Act, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan introduced a draconian 2015 budget plan. The plan increases military spending through 2024 by $483 billion - to pre-sequester levels - yet cuts non-defense spending by $791 billion.\nThis illogical plan proposes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, end Medicare as we know it, and slash critical safety-net programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP - formerly food stamps), Head Start and Pell Grants. It is ironic that a plan called the \"Path to Prosperity\" is nothing more than a path to political grandstanding and partisanship that has no place among constructive efforts focused on real prosperity for all Americans, not a select few. At a time when Americans are looking to Washington for solutions to the problems of income inequality and the ever-increasing Great Divide, the Ryan budget goes in the opposite direction. Rather than closing the gaps, it exacerbates the problems by raising taxes an average of $2,000 for middle-class families with children, according to the Office of Management and Budget, while giving the wealthiest taxpayers a break by lowering their taxes from 39.6 percent to 25 percent.\nThe Economic Policy Institute (EPI) estimates that the \"prosperity proposal\" would result in the loss of 3 million jobs over the next couple of years, thereby reversing the gradual upward trend in job creation. In short, the Ryan budget, while not surprising in its familiar ideology or fanciful push towards austerity, represents the height of irresponsibility and is a blueprint for disaster for millions of hard-working Americans. It has immediately, and rightfully, drawn widespread condemnation. Ethan Pollack, senior policy analyst with the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute concluded that much like the budget Ryan proposed last year, this one burdens seniors, the disabled, and children - while cutting taxes for the rich. \"Tax cuts for people who don't need them and economic insecurity for everyone else is grossly irresponsible budget and economic policy,\" he added.\nThe non-profit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that \"Some 69 percent of the cuts in House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's new budget would come from programs that serve people of limited means. These disproportionate cuts ... contrast sharply with the budget's rhetoric about helping the poor and promoting opportunity.\"\nThe Center for American Progress called Ryan's plan \"the same conservative, top-down policies that have failed the nation's middle and working-class families, seniors, and the economy.\" The New York Times called it \"destructive to the country's future.\"\nThankfully, spending for the next two years was set by the budget agreement passed in the Senate and the House and signed by President Obama in December 2013. So it is unlikely that the Ryan budget will become law in the short-term or is for anything more than show. Nonetheless, it is a dangerous \"vision\" for our nation. The National Urban League strongly rejects this budget because of its likely destructive impact on employment, the economy, and poverty. We urge Paul Ryan and his colleagues to drop this plan and get serious about developing a responsible budget that does not depend on hurting millions of working and middle-class Americans to benefit the richest few. I would expect that Rep. Ryan would be more conscious of the critical need to accomplish this, especially as this year's State of Black America report and the new Black-White Metropolitan Equality Index\u2122 finds that three of the five least equal cities in America for unemployment and two of the five least equal cities for income are in his home state of Wisconsin (Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Madison; and Milwaukee and Minneapolis, respectively). With an equality index of 23.8 percent (on a 100-point scale), Madison ranked at the bottom for Black-White unemployment (18.5 percent vs. 4.4 percent). With an equality index of 40.3 percent, Minneapolis ranked at the bottom for Black-White median household income ($28,784 vs. $71,376).\nThe night before Dr. King's April 4, 1968 assassination, he said: \"The question is not, if I stop to help this man in need, what will happen to me? The question is, if I do not stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to them?...Let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make America what it ought to be. We have an opportunity to make America a better nation.\" We can start now by stopping the Ryan budget - and even more importantly, stopping its budget-cutting fever that threatens the economic health and recovery of our nation. Marc H. Morial, former mayor of New Orleans, is president and CEO of the National Urban League."

Wage growth has been the last major measure to make meaningful progress since the end of the Great Recession.\n\nThe Federal Reserve would like wages to grow even faster -- 3% or more -- but Friday's report was a welcome sign for workers after years of stagnant pay.\n\nEconomists say it's time to take note of how strong, or \"tight,\" the U.S. job market is.\n\nFriday's numbers show 2018 \"will be a year of rising wages and the tightest labor market in over a generation,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief U.S. economist at RSM, an accounting and consulting firm.\n\nSome economists anticipate that the Republican tax law will continue to boost wages, because some large corporations are giving their workers raises. One-time bonuses, which many other companies have given out, are not counted in the wage growth calculation.\n\nSeveral states also raised their minimum wage at the start of the year, which helped overall wages grow. And experts say wages had to rise at some point as the country kept adding jobs and unemployment stayed low.\n\nIn a tight job market, there are more jobs available than there are workers to fill them. That forces employers to offer higher pay to attract and keep workers.\n\n\"It's too early to call this a trend but the breakout [in wage growth] is very welcome news,\" says Robert Frick, chief economist at Navy Federal \"It's a very big deal, let's hope it continues.\"\n\nEmployers' words may finally be translating into action. For years, employers have increasingly said they can't find skilled workers -- or any workers -- to apply for job openings. Some economists say there's a wide gap between the skills employers are demanding and the ones workers have.\n\nBut other experts contest that if employers were really desperate for workers, they would raise their wages to recruit or retain new employees. Regardless, America has nearly 6 million job openings, near a record high.\n\n\"There is no question that employers are now having to be more aggressive to compete for workers,\" says Peter Harrison, CEO of Snagajob, a jobs platform focused on hourly work.\n\n\"We are really firing on all cylinders,\" says Josh Wright, chief economist at iCIMS, a software firm focused on human resources. \"It just shows how broad the growth and the positive feelings are across the economy.\"\n\nStill, it wasn't all good news. Job gains in December and November were revised down by a cumulative 24,000 jobs than previously reported. The number of Americans working part-time jobs but seeking full-time work rose a notch to about 5 million workers. And Americans clocked in for fewer hours: The average work week declined a bit to about 34 hours a week.\n\nBut overall, economists note the gains in January illustrate a job market that's come a long way from the Great Recession, which ended in 2009. The economy has added jobs for 88 consecutive months, the longest streak on record. Unemployment has gone from 10% in 2009 to 4.1% today. Jobless claims are at their lowest point in decades. Consumer confidence remains just below its highest point in 18 years.\n\nThe move could also force the Federal Reserve to raise its key interest rate faster. Fed officials in December forecast raising rates three times in 2018. But if wages continue to pick up, that could boost inflation. Faster inflation would force the Fed to raise rates faster or more frequently.\n\nAmerican investors certainly see more rate increases on the horizon. The yield on the 10-year U.S. bond shot up to 2.84% after the jobs report, reflecting higher expectations of more rate hikes."

        "webpage": "Do's and Don'ts of Advisory Contracts\nThe purpose of compliance examinations is to determine whether RIAs are operating their businesses in accordance with the Investment Advisers Act, as well as the rules adopted to interpret the statute. Additionally, examiners attempt to ascertain whether RIAs are making full disclosure to existing and prospective clients. Examiners analyze RIAs' policies and procedures to learn whether they are thorough, effective, and designed to protect investors. Policies and procedures should effectively address the RIA's compliance risks.\nThe SEC has been criticized for not examining RIAs on a regular basis. On November 16, 2011, Carlo di Florio, the director of the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), testified before a Senate subcommittee and stated that only eight percent of RIAs were examined in 2011. Furthermore, di Florio said that thirty-eight percent of SEC-registered investment advisors have never undergone an examination by the Commission. As we saw in Risk-Based Oversight of Investment Advisors, examinations are more likely to be prompted by tips, complaints, or aspects of an RIA's business model that make it appear to pose a greater risk to investors. The SEC is more likely to examine a firm that is viewed as a higher risk.\nState securities regulators have their own criteria for choosing which RIAs to examine. Many states are making a concerted effort to examine every advisory firm at least once every few years. Certainly, in almost every state, examinations are likely to be prompted by tips or complaints. A Pennsylvania compliance examiner recently said he will sometimes look at RIA advertisements to determine which firms to examine. If an advertisement is misleading or promises too much, the RIA may become the subject of an examination.\nIn preparation for a compliance examination, securities regulators will request numerous records. In almost all cases, they will ask to see copies of an RIA's advisory agreements. The examination is likely to end badly if the RIA cannot produce a contract requested or if the firm's records are incomplete. There will also be a problem if advisory contracts do not comply with applicable SEC or state rules.\nRequirements for Advisory Contracts\nIf an investment advisor merely looked at the statute, the requirements for advisory contracts would seem to be relatively simple. Section 205(a)(1) of the Investment Advisers Act states that advisory contracts shall not:\nprovide for compensation to the RIA on the basis of a share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client;\nfail to provide, in substance, that no assignment of a contract shall be made by the RIA without the consent of the other party to the contract; or\nfail to provide, in substance, that the RIA, if a partnership, will notify the other party to the contract of any change in the membership of the partnership within a reasonable time after the change occurs.\nThese requirements ensure that clients do not enter an agreement that will jeopardize their well-being. For example, when an RIA is permitted to charge a fee based on performance, the advisor may put a client's portfolio at risk in order to generate a better return. In Dealings With Qualified Clients and Accredited Investors, we will discuss situations where an RIA is permitted to charge a performance fee.\nExaminers will scrutinize client agreements during examinations. Over time, these contracts may become outdated. Although the RIA's fees and business model may have changed, a new advisory contract may never have been executed. Quite often, examiners uncover instances where contracts are inconsistent with regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the advisor may not be living up to the terms of the agreement.\nThe RIA's advisory contract should state clearly if the firm has discretionary or non-discretionary authority. Obviously, RIAs should only take actions that are within the scope of the authority authorized by the advisory agreement. Clients grant an RIA authority to make trades on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. The contractual language might appear as follows:\nDiscretionary Basis\nBy execution of this Agreement, Client hereby establishes an Investment Advisory Account (Account) and appoints Advisor as the investment manager to supervise and direc"

Would Hong Kong's dynamism and openness catalyze change in China, or would the Communist Party try to remake the freewheeling city-state in its image? Sixteen years on, we know it's more the latter than the former. Beijing has shackled Hong Kong with one bad, handpicked leader after another. China's commissars and their local lackeys continue to push anti-sedition laws, patriotic education and Mandarin on 7 million people who seek democracy and prefer Cantonese. Now, the \"one country, two systems\" principle that Deng Xiaoping negotiated with U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decades ago faces perhaps its biggest challenge: China's wobbly economy. A downturn on the mainland threatens to erode Hong Kong's AAA credit rating, and to alienate the city's population once and for all. After the handover, China's Communist Party carved out a tacit deal with Hong Kong's citizens. It boiled down to, \"We'll make you richer with our 10 percent-plus growth, if you don't push us too hard on this democracy stuff.\" The relationship hasn't always gone smoothly. The giant protests of 2003, one drawing more than half a million people, and many smaller ones since -- including one this week that drew tens of thousands -- show that the balancing act requires constant calibration. The arrangement could go very much awry as China slows. China's credit clampdown is causing wild stock swings in Hong Kong, whose entire economy is underpinned by asset prices. Last week, Moody's Investors Service cut its outlook for Hong Kong's banking system to \"negative\" as analysts assess lenders' growing exposure to borrowers in China. Mainland Exposure Inflation-adjusted interest rates in Hong Kong have been negative since early 2009. That has led its banks to become increasingly reliant on mainland clients -- cash-rich investors who have been buying all the Hong Kong property they can. Hong Kong banks boosted mainland exposure to 16.5 percent of consolidated total assets by the end of 2012, compared with 9.8 percent in 2009. Lenders mitigated some risk by requiring"

Instead of stalling the good progress the industry has made post the rise of the uncertainties and \"disruptions\" some of the FinTech sector poses, the whole ecosystem remains unfazed, undeterred and cooperative in embracing the challenges together.

This paper uses a variety of approaches to model cost and profit inefficiencies as well as technical change for different ownership types in the German banking market. We find little evidence to suggest that privately owned banks are more efficient than their mutual and public-sector counterparts. While all three bank ownership types benefit from widespread economies of scale, inefficiency measures indicate that public and mutual banks have slight cost and profit advantages over their private sector competitors. OVER THE YEARS, a considerable literature has developed on the relationship between industrial ownership and performance. Two clear messages from that literature are (i) that ownership can be important; and (ii) that it is helpful to view the issue in the context of the principal-agent framework and public choice theory. However, while that literature has provided considerable understanding of the effects of ownership, its primary focus is on nonfinancial firms. This paper shifts the focus to banks and to the question of whether the ownership structure of banks influences their economic behavior. In particular, the paper attempts to evaluate whether cost and profit inefficiencies and technical change are related to bank ownership structures. The empirical work is carried out in the context of the German banking market which has a broad mix of ownership forms--private, public, and mutual. Reasons for different ownership forms leading to different efficiency levels have been extensively explored in the literature; and the dominant model to consider the effect of ownership utilizes the principal agent framework and public choice theory to highlight the importance of management being constrained by capital market discipline. The theoretical argument is straightforward: a lack of capital market discipline weakens owners' control over management, making management freer to pursue its own agenda, and giving it fewer incentives to be efficient. However, whilst extensive empirical evidence provides some support for the hypothesis that public enterprises perform less efficiently than private enterprises, it should be noted that this theoretical argument is not without its critics.(1) Also, it should be stressed that the empirical work has largely concentrated on the simple dichotomy of privately owned and publicly owned firms, particularly nonfinancial firms, and particularly in noncompetitive environments.(2) In turning to the banking industry, it is clear that not only is the industry highly competitive, but also that in many countries mutual ownership must be considered alongside that of public and private ownership forms. In addition, there is relatively little guidance from the literature about the relative efficiency of these three ownership forms of financial firms. One way forward is to ask the more general question of why management may not be minimizing their costs of production (in each of the ownership forms). This question is, of course, central to the well-established literature on X-inefficiency (Leibenstein 1966) and technical inefficiency (Farrell 1957)--a literature that emphasizes the role of environmental pressure in weakening management's incentive to be efficient. High levels of competition in a firm's market is a classic example of a high-intensity environmental pressure that should strengthen management's incentive to be efficient.(3) In the specific case of the banking industry, the separation of ownership from control is common to all three ownership forms. However, the lack of capital market discipline, common to mutual and public ownership, may indicate that management in these banks experience a lower intensity of environmental pressure and therefore may operate less efficiently than privately owned banks. ...

Such a solution would mean higher taxes for the CFOs' companies. Simpson-Bowles pairs every $2 of spending cuts with $1 of tax increases.CFOs of firms in a variety of industries -- including manufacturing, construction, retail, technology, banking and finance -- contribute to the Global Business Outlook survey.\nMore On The 'Fiscal Cliff' And Taxes:\nWhat makes up the 'fiscal cliff'?\nTax help and stories\nInvesting stories\nThe survey has been conducted by Duke University and CFO magazine for 67 straight fiscal quarters. It spans Europe, Asia, Latin America and the United States, although much of the data related to the U.S. fiscal situation came from U.S. firms only. The most recent survey concluded Dec. 7.'Fiscal cliff' dangersSimpson-Bowles would do a better job of targeting necessary spending cuts than simply allowing arbitrary cuts to occur as a result of plunging over the so-called fiscal cliff, according to John Graham, a professor of finance at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business in Durham, N.C., and director of the Global Business Outlook survey.Also, the fiscal cliff would raise tax rates across the board, which would discourage investment and work, he says. By contrast, Simpson-Bowles would get most of the increased tax revenue from reduced deductions, and not higher rates.\"In fact, Simpson-Bowles proposes lower tax rates, which might encourage growth,\" says Graham. On the other hand, Simpson-Bowles proposes higher tax rates on dividend and capital gains income, which might discourage investment to some degree, he says.Allowing the U.S. to plunge over the fiscal cliff could cause serious economic repercussions, according to Graham.\n\"The business community and financial markets will lose faith in the ability of the U.S. political process to solve important problems,\" he says.The survey found that 70 percent of CFOs will reduce hiring if the nation goes over the fiscal cliff. Going over the cliff also would hurt businesses for years to come, according to the CFOs. More than two-thirds expect their companies to be in worse shape five years from now unless lawmakers reach a deal by Jan. 1 and stop short of falling over the fiscal cliff.A slow 2013Even if a solution is implemented, spending will be cut and tax collections will increase. That likely means a slow 2013 for the economy, says Graham.CFOs worried about the fiscal cliff already are planning for a soft economy next year, according to the survey. As a result, they expect the following for the rest of 2012 and throughout 2013.Shrinking bonuses. Among firms paying bonuses in 2012, nearly 40 percent will reduce their payouts this year.Stalled business spending. CFOs plan to increase capital spending by just 2.5 percent next year, which is down from 7.3 percent in the spring.

That follows a 13,000 drop in September. The total number of hours worked also fell, and the number of people looking for work but unable to find it rose by more than 100,000, to 8.1 million.\nMeanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management reported that its index of conditions in the manufacturing sector fell last month to 48.5, the weakest reading this year, from 49.5 in September. Both readings were below 50, the point at which the index shows that manufacturing activity is neither expanding nor contracting. The index was 50.5 in both July and August, indicating that the factory sector is not better off than it was in June, analysts said.\nIn another report, the Commerce Department said that consumer spending fell 0.6 percent in September after adjustment for inflation, despite a healthy 0.4 percent rise in personal incomes. Most of the spending decline was due to a sharp drop in motor vehicle purchases.\nEarlier this week, consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in nine years, and late last week, the Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods fell significantly in September.\n\"In the past two weeks a flurry of indicators suggest the economy weakened sharply in September and October,\" economist Joseph T. Abate of Lehman Brothers in New York told his firm's clients. \"With momentum flagging, the rapid erosion in confidence and the pick up in uncertainty are likely to severely restrain consumer and investment spending over the next three to six months.\"\nAbate said the lower level of vehicle purchases in September and October indicates that \"the consumer response to incentives appears to have gotten weaker with each re-introduction of interest-free financing. Likewise, a sharp pull-back in durable goods orders in September suggests that businesses are not yet ready to expand capacity.\"\nLike many other forecasters, those at Lehman Brothers have lowered their predictions for economic growth for the remainder of this year and early next year. The Lehman forecast now calls for the economy to grow at only a 1 percent annual rate in the current quarter and at a 1.5 percent rate in the first three months of 2003. And by early next year the jobless rate is predicted to rise by a half-percentage point, to 6.2 percent.\nWhile most analysts and investors are convinced that the recent string of bad economic news will cause the Fed next week to lower its 1.75 percent target for overnight interest rates, they are divided over whether the cut will be a quarter- or a half-percentage point. The decision will be made at a meeting Wednesday of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's top policymaking group.\nFed officials are concerned that rising uncertainty over the prospect of war with Iraq and other factors will inhibit both consumer and business spending and keep economic growth sub-par for an extended period.\nRead more Economic Outlook online\nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE NEW YORK IRAQ DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BUSINESS_FINANCE JOSEPH T.

LaFaive, published on May 5, 2008\n(Author's Note: On April 18, 2008, I was asked to provide five minutes worth of remarks on questions involving economic development in Michigan at a forum held in downtown Midland. I was happy to do so.)\nQuestion No. 3: What is the tax and business incentives climate in Michigan? How does it affect our economic development abilities?\nTax and business incentives in Michigan are greatly overdone and have expanded to such a degree that they now include refundable tax credits. But exhaustive research has shown that, at best, state and local development efforts have no impact on real economic growth.\nFirst, and in the broadest sense, research from 2002 indicates that state and local units of government expend about $50 billion annually on business incentives with no apparent impact. In your folder is a META review of the literature titled \"The Failure of Economic Development Incentives.\" A META review is essentially a review of reviews of scholarly literature on a particular topic. This review encompasses a \"massive\" amount of research literature and concludes that there were \"theoretical, empirical and practical [reasons] to believe that economic development incentives have little or no impact on firm location and investment decisions.\"\nSecond, it does not appear that Michigan has fared any better. In 2005 I published a 127-page review of Michigan's premier economic development program, known as MEGA, the Michigan Economic Growth Authority. This study included a powerful time-series econometric model that was peer reviewed by one of the authors of this META review. We proved that MEGA had no impact on employment, the unemployment rate or per-capita personal income statewide, or in counties where firms who got the tax breaks are located. Every $123,000 in MEGA tax credits promised resulted in a single construction job, but those jobs existed for no more than two years. Moreover, counties hosting a MEGA company did no better or worse than those without MEGA recipients. To date, neither the MEDC (Michigan Economic Development Corp.) nor the Legislature has  -  to my knowledge  -  refuted a single point of fact in this study. This should be a source of deep embarrassment to both institutions, particularly in light of MEGA's continued state support and expansion. We do not blame companies for taking what is offered, but the incentives should not be offered in the first place.\nThird, and concerning Michigan's local development work, is the subject of property tax abatements. Last year two scholars from Michigan State University and Wayne State University (Gary Sands and Laura Reese) unveiled their comprehensive study on local property tax abatements in Michigan. They concluded that \"data on the number of PA 198 certificates issued by individual communities from 1980 to 2001\nfail to show a clear, consistent relationship between abatement activity and change in economic health.\" This was not the first study to come to that conclusion. In short, these incentive games do not work. A better alternative is for government to distinguish itself with broader-based policy changes at both the state and local levels. Cutting taxes and spending and rolling back unnecessary regulation would do far more for incentivizing business development and expansion. That means passing right-to-work legislation, eliminating the Michigan Business Tax, cutting local taxes, reining in the Department of Environmental Quality and eliminating zoning regulations.\n(Addendum: All too often, those who defend government economic development programs argue that scrapping such programs would be the equivalent of \"unilateral disarmament\" in the economic war between the states. Not true. If it doesn't work it is not unilateral disarmament because it was never armament in the first place. Ultimately, those who play the incentive game are fighting over job announcements, not real jobs.)\nPost a public comment on this.\nView all comments on Mackinac Center articles."

Consumer prices rose 1.4 percent in the year ended in May. Unemployment stood at 7.6 percent in June. Editor's Note: Obama 'Blunder' Spawns Massive Profit Opportunity\n\"In other words, there's plenty of room to do more as far as stimulus is concerned because inflation's not a risk,\" Naroff said. \"We're just not getting the traction in the economy that we should be getting. So why are they talking about ending quantitative easing now? They should be waiting until it's really clear that the economy has begun to accelerate.\"\nWatch our exclusive video. Article continues below.\nGDP expanded only 1.8 percent in the first quarter, and many economists expect even slower growth in the second quarter. \"It was a policy mistake\" to announce the potential tapering, Naroff said. \"They want to have more communications, but there's so much division at the Fed that they felt they had to say something.\"\nEditor's Note: Know the story behind the numbers: Forecaster Joel Naroff provides timely, expert analysis of key economic data for Financial Braintrust Alliance members.Visit  for more information and to sign up.\nBernanke moved to reassure the public Wednesday that the Fed isn't abandoning its easing program, and that points out the downside of the Fed's effort at transparency, Naroff said. \"It's a clear indication of the problems that the Fed faces when it tries to communicate what they intend to do in the future,\" he said. \"This is a situation where the Fed worked really hard out of a really difficult recession. They were making progress, but clearly not enough. They start talking about the need to end some of the stimulus, and all of a sudden interest rates back up 100 basis points.\"\nThe 10-year Treasury yield hit an almost-three-year high of 2.75 percent Monday.\n\"So they're really worried that being open has sent the wrong message, and what he's trying to do . . . is kind of walk it on back.\"\nEditor's Note: Obama 'Blunder' Spawns Massive Profit Opportunity\nBernanke said Wednesday that \"highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future is what's needed in the U.S. economy.\"\nThe uncertainty about the Fed makes things difficult for investors, Naroff said. \"The markets keep demanding openness from the Fed. They want to know,\" he said. \"There's a fundamental problem with that. The problems is the Fed's got to say either we're going to do something on this date, or we're going to do something in the future but we're not sure when.\"\nBut either way, the Fed's ultimate action depends on future economic data. \"This creates a lot of uncertainty, because the reality, especially in this recovery, is sometimes the data are good, sometimes they're not good,\" Naroff said. Market volatility is the result, he said. \"So, for investors, what they've got to do is really focus on where the economy is, because where the economy is and where it's going is ultimately going to determine what the Fed does, rather than what they happen to say at any particular press conference or speech.\""

The U.K. central bank said in its quarterly Inflation Report that it expects the economy to expand 3.4% in 2014, the same forecast it made in February, and that annual inflation will be close to its 2% target over the next two to three years if interest rates in the U.K. rise in line with expectations in financial markets. Traders expect the central bank to lift its benchmark interest rate from a 320-year low of 0.5% in the first quarter of next year. Officials led by Gov. Mark Carney believe the U.K. economy can grow faster without stoking inflation because slack in the labor market is bearing down on wages and prices. Annual inflation was below the BOE's 2% target at 1.6% in April. Despite a recent growth spurt, the U.K. is still recovering from the financial crisis that crippled its banks and tipped it into recession in early 2008. The economy is only now regaining its precrisis size. The U.S. surpassed its earlier peak in 2010. A rate rise early next year would nevertheless make the U.K. central bank the first among its major peers to lift borrowing costs from the emergency settings adopted in response to the crisis. The Federal Reserve is expected to follow suit later in 2015. In its May report, the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee said there has been a \"modest narrowing\" in the amount of slack over the past three months but that their best estimate is that there is spare capacity in the economy equivalent to between 1% and 1.5% of annual output. That is the same range the panel published in February. \"The MPC judges that there remains scope to make greater inroads into slack before raising Bank Rate,\" the committee said in its May report, referring to the BOE's benchmark interest rate, which has been at 0.5% since March 2009. One big change in the latest forecasts: the MPC now expects unemployment in the U.K. to fall faster than they did in February. The jobless rate was 6.8% in March, according to official data Wednesday, and officials see it reaching 5.9% in the second quarter of 2017. Three months ago they thought joblessness would be 6.3% in early 2017. Such a fall in joblessness would normally be expected to push inflation higher. But officials set out several reasons why they don't think that will happen. For one thing, Mr. Carney and his colleagues believe the labor market contains pockets of slack bearing down on prices that aren't captured by overall unemployment. Surveys show many workers aren't working as many hours as they would like and others have joined the ranks of the self-employed while they search for a full-time job. May's forecasts also show officials believe that the long-term unemployed may re-enter the workforce as the economy heals. Another factor expected to keep a lid on inflation is a stronger pound, which tends to make imports cheaper. The pound has risen against rivals by about 10% over the past year, according to the BOE.

From the September Special Report issue of Treasury & Risk magazine\nKnow Thy Banking Partners\nIn the wake of the financial crisis, corporate treasuries are paying closer attention to the risks they're exposed to in dealing with their banks.\nBy Susan Kelly September 4, 2013 \u2022 Reprints\nThe events of the last five years have reshaped companies' understanding of the risks they face when dealing with their banks. While concerns about bank counterparty risk have subsided from the levels seen in the immediate wake of the U.S. financial crisis and during the various flare-ups of Europe's sovereign debt crisis, the lessons have sunk in.\n\"Corporate treasurers certainly have wakened up to the fact that when it comes to the banks they've dealing with, things can happen,\" said Matthew Dunn, senior manager in Deloitte's treasury risk management practice. \"Things can happen fairly quickly. As we saw in the crisis, even large banks could not exist anymore overnight. It really can happen that fast.\"\nThe crises resulted in many conversations between corporate treasurers and their banks, said Greg Kavanaugh, head of the global liquidity product team at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"Whether it was the economic crisis in 2007-2009 or the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, we witnessed clients rechecking their policies, rechecking their counterparties and checking where they stand with them,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\"That reactive response, whether to the economic crisis or the sovereign debt crisis, has diminished as the economies that our clients conduct business in have stabilized,\" he added.\nGlobal regulators' efforts to ensure that banks are properly capitalized have helped eased treasurers' concerns.\nDunn pointed out that in the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has pushed for a bank leverage ratio as high as 6%, double what is required under Basel III. \"For corporates dealing with these large banks, it lowers the risk,\" he said. Dunn noted, though, that banks face additional costs to comply with new regulations and hold more capital, and those costs are likely to be passed on to their customers, including corporate buyers.\nKavanaugh said that it was not just the regulators' actions, but banks' responses to the new requirements that proved reassuring.\n\"I think the level at which banks have capitalized and discussed their healthier capital base has been very important,\" said Kavanaugh, pictured at left. \"For example, some banks would appear to be ahead of some of the anticipated regulatory requirements, even though all of those regulatory requirements haven't been fully fleshed out.\"\nRegulators' efforts have also given treasurers benchmarks to use when they're assessing the health of their financial institutions, said Michael Berkowitz, head of liquidity management services and corporate market management for Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions North America.\n\"Within Basel III, the Tier 1 capital ratio is one metric corporate treasurers can look at in terms of the financial strength of banks,\" Berkowitz said, noting that while Basel I included a Tier 1 capital ratio, the Basel III ratio is viewed as a much better indicator of banks' financial strength. \"It provides reassurance to the extent that banks have adequate ratios within the capital ratio requirement. And certainly, to the extent that they're not meeting the minimum thresholds, it provides something that corporate treasurers need to look further into.\"\nTracking Counterparty Risk\nAs corporate treasurers consider the possibility that one of their banks could run into problems, perhaps the biggest response has been an expansion in treasuries' monitoring of their banks.\nDennis Gannon, a senior director with CEB, an Arlington, Va.-based advisory company, said the focus on counterparty risk has created \"a new normal of due diligence and monitoring that goes on - bank reviews, heat mapping, contingency planning - that simply was not there 10 years ago.\"\nOne practice Gannon sees emerging among treasury departments is the use of a counterparty risk dashboard to track the health of banks and assist in making decisions about which banks to use.\n\"Most of the analysis and dashboards are being done in-house, typically with some element of external automated data, whether it's from Bloomberg or somewhere else,\" he said. \"Generally speaking, credit ratings, [credit default swap] levels and other indicators of bank health - Tier 1 capital ratios or things like that - will make up the bulk of the dashboard.\"\nCorporations used to rely mostly on credit ratings to monitor their banks, said Citi's Berkowitz, pictured at left. \"Today it's a much more nuanced view,\" he said. \"While credit ratings have a role, they're essentially static instruments that are retrospective in the way they're put together. There are now a number of other metrics corporate treasurers would look at.\"\nSome of things treasury teams look at can be evaluated every day, Berkowitz said, such as credit default swap spreads or stock and bond pr"

Cohan\nFour years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the near-total paralysis of capitalism's central nervous system - the moment fear completely overwhelmed greed on Wall Street - we are starting to see a few glimmers of hope.\nOP-ED / LETTERS TO THE EDITOR U.S. banks are ignoring Europe's lesson on greed\nSaturday, September 22, 2012 12:05 am Guest  D. Cohan\nThe good news: Several big banks have finally started taking steps to reform Wall Street's out-of-control compensation system, which rewards bankers and traders with big bonuses for taking insane risks with other people's money. The bad news: These banks are in Europe, and most of their U.S. cousins still just don't get it.\nIn recent days, both Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG announced plans to change their compensation systems. Deutsche Bank said that the portion of the pay its top 150 managing directors receive in the form of deferred stock would vest after five years, instead of three, which should concentrate their minds for a bit longer. The bank also appointed an outside committee to examine its pay practices generally, and pledged to be at the forefront of change in the industry. While not yet the sort of extensive transformation that will protect the rest of us from bankers' bad behavior, the Deutsche Bank proposals at least prove the old saw that in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man remains king.\nUBS, for its part, said it is considering capping banker and trader bonuses and making them a function of the executives' fixed salaries or of the bank's profitability.\nIn the U.S., though, there has been virtual silence on the topic. Bankers and traders on Wall Street still get rewarded with big bonuses solely based upon the revenue they generate from the products they sell. As for accountability, forget it.\nWorse, neither Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., or Jamie Dimon, his counterpart at JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Wall Street's highest-profile leaders - have said anything about changing this flawed system, while continuing to be paid tens of millions in annual compensation. Instead, Goldman cut corners by eliminating its two-year analyst program for college seniors. This is not leadership.\nTo his credit, James Gorman, the CEO of Morgan Stanley, has at least addressed the flawed Wall Street compensation system: In 2011, Morgan Stanley's bankers and traders had their cash bonuses capped at $125,000. Gorman said publicly, at the World Economic Forum in January, if they didn't like it, they could just leave. And just as the basic compensation structure on Wall Street remains for the most part unchanged, so too does its behavior, despite the passage of the Dodd-Frank law and the ceaseless writing and rewriting of the new regulations it mandated.\nWall Street behavior merely reflects the latest acceptable norms in society as a whole, which sadly has seen a steady decline in ethics, morality, compliance and leadership in the last generation.\nWall Street has taught Main Street the wonders of stock options and \"golden parachutes\" and excessive executive compensation, among other things, all of which are designed to enrich the few at the top with a minimal amount of accountability for their behavior.\nWe have also been inundated in the last year with the facts of just how easy it is for private-equity and hedge-fund moguls to make fortunes using other people's money while minimizing the amount of taxes they pay. If the financial crisis and its aftermath have taught us anything, though, it is that greed is not always good. Not even close. \u2022\nWilliam D.

But it shows how he helped turn a war-torn Colombia from a near-failed state to a top investment destination. Uribe's security gains remain frail, but his successes dwarf those of his leftist peers in Latin America.\nUribe's story is as remarkable as it is unlikely. When he took office in 2002, a weak government was quickly losing a war against right-wing militias and one-time Marxist rebels, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The insurgents were financed by extortion, kidnappings and a flourishing drug trade. At its worst, the drug business accounted for more than 6 percent of GDP and Colombians paid as much as $350 million in ransom to criminals annually.\nThe economy was in shambles. GDP grew a mere 1.9 percent in 2002 and foreign direct investment inflows, at a four-year average of $2.3 billion a year, were nearly half those of neighboring Venezuela. The country was widely considered one of the most dangerous places to live, visit or do business.\nBut by halfway through Uribe's eight-year tenure, the militias were decimated and FARC was a shadow of its former self. Kidnappings had dropped by 80 percent and homicides by half. By the time Uribe left in 2010, annual GDP growth was averaging 4.5 percent. And foreign investment had risen four-fold to $8 billion a year, mostly due to a thriving oil sector. The market capitalization of Colombia's state-owned Ecopetrol, which sold 20 percent of its shares to the public under Uribe, now rivals that of BP.\nUribe walks readers through the turnaround. As president he deployed the military to secure the country's main thoroughfares for the first time in years. This allowed Colombians to travel and do business within their own country. His administration rewarded citizens for tips leading to the capture of key insurgents and made the elimination of top FARC leaders a military priority. Crucially, his successes helped him convince Colombia's wealthy to endure higher taxes to help fund military spending. He later offered tax exemptions to foster job creation.\nUribe's personal travails make the book read like a spy novel. A 30-year old Uribe lost his father to FARC guerrillas. As he rose in politics he personally endured countless threats and survived scores of kidnapping and assassination attempts. When he was a senator in the early 1990s, leftist guerrillas determined to stop his push to reform social security placed a bomb in a hotel room next to his. He barely survived. Years later, as a governor, Uribe even exchanged machine gun fire with guerrillas as he and his aides suffered an ambush.\nBut the steely persona that earned Uribe consistent 70 percent approval ratings masks a less flattering side. In his drive to change Colombia he tacitly encouraged supporters to push a constitutional reform that could grant him a third term as president. Thankfully for Colombia's democracy, this never materialized. And his reputed links to paramilitary groups during his time as governor remain under investigation. Uribe barely touches on those issues in his book.\nYet his achievements still outshine his misses. Poverty fell by more than half to 22 percent under his tenure, most of it through job creation. Just next door, Venezuela's Hugo Chavez has spent billions of dollars of oil revenue making the poor dependent on state handouts. Guerrilla attacks remain an issue, but Colombia as a country is safer and richer.

        "webpage": "hide Puerto Rico governor offers debt restructuring for public corporations\nSAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla unveiled a bankruptcy-like process for some public corporations to restructure their debts on Wednesday, in a fresh bid to shore up the U.S. territory's deteriorating finances.\nThe governor's proposed legislation, expected to pass the legislature soon, would apply to the semi-autonomous public authorities that manage Puerto Rico's infrastructure and are unable to pay their debts. It offers two options for adjusting debts: a seven-step voluntary restructuring process approved by creditors or a process overseen by the island's courts.\n\"The principal purpose of this law is to protect the interests of the people of Puerto Rico and to assure that the existing void in federal law does not put in danger essential public services,\" the governor said.\nHe added that Puerto Rico could not sacrifice \"all we have done to save the general fund\" because \"some public corporations don't have the structure to pay their debts.\"\nSome analysts have said that reforming the corporations is key to salvaging the territory's finances. After years of economic and population declines, Puerto Rico is struggling to stay afloat. All three rating agencies have cut the territory's credit score to junk and the island has hired restructuring consultants to help handle $70 billion in outstanding debt.\nThe territory's woes have spread into the wider $3.7 trillion municipal bond market. The island's debt has been popular in the past because its interest is exempt from federal and state taxation.\nThe law would not apply to the territory's general obligations. Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities, Government Development Bank (GDB), retirement systems and some other authorities are also excluded.\nA few corporations are already considering restructuring, but none has made a decision, Garcia Padilla said.\nThe Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) called a last-minute meeting of its board of directors on Wednesday. Board member Juan Rosario said he expected it was related to the restructuring bill. PREPA has one of the heaviest debt loads of the corporations, $10 billion, according to Treasury Secretary Melba Acosta Febo. Currently, it is seeking extensions of $800 million of expiring lines of credit. There is uncertainty the GDB will step in with needed liquidity if those negotiations fail. In a call with reporters, GDB board President David Chafey said the restructuring bill did not target any specific public corporation.

        "webpage": "Why You Should Love \"Unstable\" Investments\nSelena Maranjian |\nSure, you can find plenty of legitimate criticisms of the S&P 500 index. But don't kick it out of your portfolio solely because you think it's unstable. That very quality actually makes it more attractive.\nThe S&P is one of the best-known market gauges, but it certainly has its flaws. It's market-cap weighted, meaning that the components with the largest market capitalizations account for most of its value. Thus, though there are 500 companies in the index, ExxonMobil accounts for fully 3% of its value, and its top 10 holdings make up nearly 20% of its value. With the tiniest stocks in an index fund only getting 0.05% or less of the fund's assets, you're not really participating in their growth. And you don't get any exposure to stocks outside the U.S. or to smaller domestic stocks.\nChange is goodDespite all that, the S&P 500 is still a decent way to instantly own chunks of many companies that tend to grow in value over time. Thus, don't let yourself be swayed by arguments that the index is \"unstable.\" One article I read recently noted that in the 40 years or so following the inception of the index, fewer than 15% of its original 500 companies remained.\nWell, yeah. Over time, companies merge and spin off, and some just go out of business. Studies have shown that plenty of stocks removed from the index go on to do quite well, while others prove well worth removing. No investor ever makes perfect decisions, and neither do the folks running the S&P 500. But I like that the index is designed to include the \"leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy,\" rather than the leading companies of 50 or 100 years ago.\nLast year, for instance, credit-card giant Visa joined the index, and the year before, MasterCard, following each of the companies' entrance to the stock market via initial public offerings. It's hard to imagine an index representing the U.S. economy that didn't include these titans, each of which sports a market capitalization topping $30 billion.\nGeneral Motors has recently emerged from bankruptcy protection and is working on turning its fortunes around. It's already a $50 billion company, so it's hard to imagine the S&P 500 not welcoming GM back to the fold once the company meets its inclusion guidelines.\nYour portfolioNo less an authority than Warren Buffett has suggested that most of us would do well to just stick with a simple broad-market index fund. Warts and all, the S&P 500 index deserves serious consideration for a berth in your portfolio. After all, it's averaged solid growth over many decades (including this last particularly tough one). And over long periods, stocks have almost always trounced bonds and most other alternatives.\nJust be sure you understand what the index is and isn't before you buy into it. It's a market-cap-weighted, periodically tweaked index of large U.S.-based companies, and a handy way to instantly get invested in most of the U.S. market.\nAn \"unstable\" index might indeed be a dangerous investment. But a dynamic index will help your money keep growing for decades to come.\nWe Fools may not all hold the same opinions, but we all believe that considering a diverse range of insights makes us better investors.\nLongtime Fool contributor Selena Maranjian owns shares of General Electric.

        "webpage": "What Is Jamie Dimon Thinking?\nJohn Maxfield |\nOf all the big bank executives, none writes an annual letter quite like Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) . While it's obviously structured to put the bank in the best light possible, its organization and content nevertheless reveals what the nation's preeminent banker is thinking about his own business, the industry, and the economy.\nDimon's most recent letter, released earlier this week, revolves around three central concepts: the condition of JPMorgan, the ongoing legal and regulatory changes in the industry, and the prospects for the global economy going forward.\nThe first point centers on a goal Dimon has echoed for years now -- that of a \"fortress\" balance sheet. When it comes to banking, this is a function of liquidity and capital, both of which have gained in importance since the financial crisis. The idea here is that, even if JPMorgan were to be besieged by another financial crisis, it would have the means to retrench and survive the onslaught of frozen capital markets and elevated default rates.\nAlthough it's probably impossible to say what is actually sufficient in terms of both liquidity and capital given a severe economic scenario akin to the last crisis, there's no question that JPMorgan has a considerable amount of both. Of its $2.4 trillion in assets, a full $741 billion are so-called \"high-quality liquid assets,\" meaning they are \"super safe and can provide cash to the company should it need cash to survive.\" In terms of capital, meanwhile, it handily satisfies all of the current regulatory capital requirements imposed on the industry.\nThe second concept in Dimon's letter, concerning the evolving regulatory landscape, contains the meat of the conversation. His point here is twofold. First, to articulate the significance of the changes. And second, to share JPMorgan's ongoing efforts at compliance.\nThe magnitude of the changes simply can't be overemphasized. \"Fully complying with and adapting to the new world is a daunting task and will require enormous effort and energy on the part of all of us at JPMorgan,\" Dimon wrote. \"Never before have we focused so much time, technology, money and brainpower on such an enterprisewide undertaking.\"\nThe numbers he shares are staggering. The bank has hired 13,000 employees to support its regulatory, compliance, and control efforts across the entire firm, and it will have incurred $2 billion in additional expenses since 2012 as a result.\nIt's with this in mind that Dimon issued what may turn out to be a prophetic warning (emphasis added):\nIf you have to hold higher capital and higher liquidity and some of your costs are higher -- all things being equal -- your returns obviously will come down. Many analysts have estimated that the average effect of the higher capital, liquidity and costs on banks will reduce their return on equity substantially below fair market returns. These banks possibly would need to take dramatic action -- shareholders would not accept poor market returns for long.\nFinally, Dimon concludes his letter on an optimistic note by cataloguing a laundry list of reasons to be optimistic about the future. Among other things, world GDP is projected to grow an average of 7% per year over the next decade, mass urbanization trends around the globe will require an estimated $57 trillion in infrastructure investments between now and 2030, and 7,000 companies with revenue greater than $1 billion are expected to develop between 2010 and 2025.\nWhat's the takeaway from Dimon's letter? If there's one thing, it's that the banking industry is in the midst of a seismic upheaval triggered by the new regulatory and legal landscape. For a bank like JPMorgan, it seems reasonable to conclude that the enhanced requirements may further entrench it at the top of the industry. But for others, it may do just the opposite. Big banking's little $20.8 trillion secretThere's a brand-new company that's revolutionizing banking, and is poised to kill the hated traditional brick-and-mortar banks. That's bad for them, but great for investors. And amazingly, despite its rapid growth, this company is still flying under the radar of Wall Street.

        "webpage": "Roubini: Five Economic Risks for 2013 Expect 'multi-speed recovery,' 'painful deleveraging'\n2013 will look very much like 2012, Nouriel Roubini wrote in an article for Project Syndicate on Monday. Global growth will average about 3%, he wrote, but he expects a \"multi-speed recovery\" with near-trend growth rates of 5% in emerging markets and much lower, below-trend rates of 1% in developed economies.\nUnlike last year, however, Roubini expects \"painful deleveraging\" in most developed economies, and he predicts austerity will spread from the eurozone. \"Given synchronized fiscal retrenchment in most advanced economies, another year of mediocre growth could give way to outright contraction in some countries,\" he wrote.\nIndeed, most major economies have already engaged in some kind of quantitative easing: the European Central Bank, the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank, with the Bank of Japan likely to follow. It was these banks' \"unconventional\" monetary policies that led to growth in risky assets in the latter half of 2012, not improved fundamentals, Roubini wrote.\nRoubini outlined five major risks investors face in the coming months.\nFirst, the stress of the fiscal cliff is not gone forever. Roubini noted that \"sooner or later, another ugly fight will take place on the debt ceiling, the delayed sequester of spending, and a congressional 'continuing spending resolution.'\"\nSecondly, efforts to reduce risk in Europe haven't eradicated all of the region's problems. Stagnation and recession are the \"norm\" in Europe, Roubini wrote, and now there are large stocks of public and private debt.\nThe third risk is in China. That country has had to implement another round of monetary, fiscal and credit stimulus to support its unsustainable, export-focused growth model. He predicted the drag in real estate, infrastructure and industrial capacity investments will accelerate in the second half of the year, and the country's new leadership is unlikely to help.\nFourth, while Roubini predicted near-trend growth rates in emerging markets, many are suffering decelerated growth. He pointed to a heavy influence from the state as the cause. \"Their 'state capitalism' - a large role for state-owned companies; an even larger role for state-owned banks; resource nationalism; import-substitution industrialization; and financial protectionism and controls on foreign direct investment - is the heart of the problem,\" he wrote.\nFifth, more generally, but no less serious, are geopolitical risks. The entire Middle East is socially, economically and politically unstable, he wrote, with the United States and Israel at risk for conflict with Iran, which could have a detrimental effect on oil. \"The fear premium in oil markets may significantly rise and increase oil prices by 20%,\" Roubini wrote, \"leading to negative growth effects in the US, Europe, Japan, China, India and all other advanced economies and emerging markets that are net oil importers.\"\nAny one of these risks could initiate a global recession, and even if they don't \"emerge in the most extreme way,\" they will appear in some form if they haven't already, according to Roubini.\nMore Mutual Funds\nBank of Japan\nSwiss National Bank"

It also considers how developments compare with those elsewhere in Europe. The thesis is based on examination of more than 300 NAO reports, interviews with senior staff, focus groups, a thorough review of relevant literature, and comparisons with four other state audit offices. The thesis argues that VFM audit has developed into a strong form of evaluative activity, despite a number of constraints. The NAO enjoys a unique combination of the statutory power to initiate wide-ranging reviews; the right to demand documents and gain access to people; and the existence of a powerful parliamentary committee to review its work and ensure a government response to reports. Additionally, during the 1980s and 1990s, the NAO developed its VFM work, and in particular, the methods used, to become a more robust discipline. Although document review and interviews form the basis of much of the work, other methods have been added to the core repertoire, in particular, questionnaires. In addition, a broader range of methods has been used on occasions, from focus groups to systems dynamics. These developments are explained in terms of a response to broader changes in the administrative environment, in particular, new public management reforms. These have increased interest in public sector performance, enhanced the quality of information available, and given greater emphasis to service quality. Consequently, the NAO has sought to demonstrate it can 'add value' and encourage beneficial improvements to public services. Developments in methods are seen as one important way of doing this. The thesis places developments in the context of the growth of evaluative activities in the UK, whilst emphasising the particular focus of VFM work on accountability, and its links with financial audit.\nDescription: This thesis was submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University.\nURI: \nAppears in  and International RelationsDept of Politics, History and Law Theses\nSizeFormat FulltextThesis.pdf17.88 MBAdobe PDFView/Open\nItems in BURA are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated."

        "webpage": "A few days ago, at a meeting of the board of a development stage angel investment, the subject of crowdfunding came up. Although none present had first-hand experience with crowdfunding, it sounded like it might be a good way to go about raising additional funding.\n\nSo, since that meeting, to advance my professional knowledge base, I've invested a few hours into researching crowdfunding*. The subject meshes well with my interest in startup financing and could be helpful to a couple of other projects with which I'm involved.\n\nThere is a lot of crowdfunding information available on the web - sources include bloggers, Wikipedia, vendors, lawyers, and the SEC. Many authors \"have a dog in the fight.\"\n\nAs the end goal of my research was to develop a prospect list of vendors (crowdfunding sites) that could help locate equity investors for for-profit projects in the US, I assumed this would be a simple, easy research project. Well, it wasn't as simple as I'd assumed, because the term \"crowdfunding\" covers a lot, plus it's a fairly new, rapidly growing activity. Plus, there are different types of crowdfunding with vendors in many different countries operating under different rules.\n\nI learned fairly quickly that much of the chatter about crowdfunding is related to rewards-based crowd-funding. According the The Ultimate Crowdfunding Guide (\"The Guide\") \"Rewards-based crowd-funding is where contributions are exchanged for current or future of goods or services. Individuals or companies who launch campaigns may compensate contributors with something like a t-shirt, a copy of whatever they're building or even just a thank you.\"\n\nThe well-known crowdfunding sites, Kickstarter and Indiegogo, are confined to rewards-based fundraising.\n\nUnfortunately, rewards based crowd-funding doesn't work for the for-profit projects I have in mind. These projects need money in the form of equity funding and rewards aren't a practical approach.\n\nHowever, according to The Guide, \"Equity crowdfunding cannot take place in the US at scale right now. That isn't to say it can't take place at all. It can and does. There are complex rules in current law that allow a company to sell stock to \"accredited investors,\" which is basically a fancy term for millionaires... The second problem for equity crowd-funding in the US relates to solicitation. In short, it is illegal to advertise the sale of stock.\"\n\nUh-oh.\n\nSo, we have complex rules that, since the Jobs Act of 2012, the SEC is in the process of revising. Better talk with a good attorney!\n\nHowever, notwithstanding the formidable legal issues surrounding fundraising in accordance with SEC rules, brave entrepreneurs have stepped into the ring and launched equity crowdfunding sites. US based equity crowdfunding platforms include:\n\nAs best I can tell, each of the above is no more or less than a lead generating site. That is, each enables a startup to publicize itself - to the site's registered \"investors' and, in some cases, to the general public. What is unclear is the legality of each sites' approach as well as how the downstream mechanics work to achieve money in the bank.\n\nThere are hurdles and a legal thicket. But let's say we can (or think we can) get over them and raise money. Are there more issues to consider? Certainly! A main consideration, one the successful fundraiser will need to live with, is investor management and reporting. For more on this along with other downsides of crowdfunding, see this article on the \"9 Dirty Secrets of Crowdfunding.\"\n\nHaving spent a few hours looking into crowdfunding, it's apparent that it's complicated, more complicated than the vendors advertise. So I'll continue to dig."

        "webpage": "U.S. long-term debt outlook worsens\nBy Tim Fernholz\nIncreasing federal debt will be a growing burden on government action, crowding out lawmakers' ability to adopt tax and spending priorities in good times and reducing flexibility during recessions, all while making a fiscal crisis more likely and hindering long-term growth, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday.\nIn the annual Long-Term Budget Outlook, the legislature's budget scorekeepers said that the ratio of debt to GDP this year will be 69 percent, 7 percentage points higher than last year. In 2021, the CBO predicts debt will reach 76 percent of GDP, but under a more dire-and more likely-scenario, the public debt will be 101 percent of GDP 10 years from now, well into the economic danger zone of 90 percent or more.\nLast year, that worst-case scenario predicted a debt-to-GDP ratio of 87 percent in 2020, demonstrating that the public debt picture has worsened considerably, in part due to a bipartisan tax deal last year that reduced expected revenue.\nWhile much of the debt is driven by the recession's drop in tax revenues and government actions taken in response to the economic calamity, CBO highlighted the structural deficit that existed before 2007 and cites growing health care costs and the aging population as a major driver of government spending; federal health spending is set to grow from less than 6 percent of GDP today to more than 9 percent in 2035.\nThe CBO says that allowing the 2010 tax deal that extended Bush administration tax policies to expire as planned would be helpful in keeping government sustainable, noting \"that significant increase in revenues and decrease in the relative magnitude of other spending would offset much-though not all-of the rise in spending on health care programs and Social Security.\"\nHowever, the CBO's more likely scenario assumes that the tax deal is extended, that the alternative minimum tax would continue to be restricted, and that the \"doc fix,\" Congress's annual decision to ease limits on Medicare physician pay, will occur as expected. Under this scenario, debt would rise to 187 percent of the economy in 2035.\nWhile CBO does not provide policy recommendations, it urged policymakers to take significant action to reduce the deficit and debt by reducing spending, increasing taxes, or some combination of the two. While those changes will slow economic recovery, the agency warns, the sooner they are made, the more gradual they can be, easing the transition into new policies but likely requiring sacrifices from older Americans.\n\"CBO's new long-term budget outlook again highlights the urgency of reaching agreement on a bipartisan and comprehensive long-term deficit and debt reduction plan,\" Senate Budget Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said in a statement. \"We must address the projected explosion in federal debt. If we fail to act, it will have devastating consequences for our economy and for the future well-being of the American people.\"\nOn Thursday, CBO Director Doug Elmendorf will testify at a House Budget Committee hearing on the long-term outlook."

McCartney | | \nAlthough many Americans have followed its media coverage more closely than any political story since Watergate, \"There is no such thing as the fiscal cliff,\" said Michael J. Beazley, City of Oregon administrator and Lucas County Land Bank president.\n\"It's a metaphor, and the challenge is that nobody really knows what it means to fall off a cliff,\" Beazley said. \"Very few people usually talk about it afterward. They're usually smashed at the bottom.\"\nThe term \"fiscal cliff\" comes from a statement Ben Bernanke, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, made to the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee in February. Bernanke said the U.S. faced \"a massive fiscal cliff of large spending cuts and tax increases\" that would take place Jan. 1.\nLocal politicians prefer to refer to it as a fiscal \"slope\" or \"scree,\" because they say the economic effect will be felt gradually, not immediately as the word \"cliff\" implies.\n\"I think it's not so much a cliff as a slippery slope, but the problem is it's the kind of slippery slope that you have in the Himalayas,\" said Peter Ujvagi, Lucas County administrator. \"They call that stone  -  marble and small pebbles  -  'scree.' You have to be very, very careful how you walk on it because one missed step and you're sliding down the mountainside.\"\nWhatever it is called, many local city and county politicians, business leaders, administrators of government entitlement programs, religious and civic social service agency personnel and educators have called what could happen \"irresponsible\" and \"bad public policy.\" Congress could allow the nation to fall off the cliff by allowing the policies scheduled for early 2013 to go into effect. Or, as some suggest, Congress could purposely choose to not reach a compromise before Jan. 1 and force the nation to jump off the cliff as a way to motivate politicians to reach an immediate and comprehensive solution to the nation's fiscal problems.\n\"That is a highly irresponsible approach for people to take,\" said Steve Herwat, Toledo's deputy mayor of operations. \"The idea of thinking, 'Let's force the country into recession so that maybe we'll wise up and not do what we've been doing' is a ludicrous way to approach the issue.\"\nWade Kapszukiewicz, Lucas County treasurer, said that if going over the cliff didn't \"destroy the economy, it would at least certainly send it back into another recession. Unemployment would go back up, and perversely, some right ideologues might look at this as some sort of short-term victory for their side because it would look like [President Barack] Obama failed.\n\"My attitude is: We just went through an election. It's over. The voters' verdict is clear and straightforward. They want their representatives to serve them well and do what's in the best interest of the country.\n\"And they don't mind cuts to services  -  program cuts, spending cuts  -  as long as there's the sense the burden is being shared and that the wealthiest among us pay a higher share.\"\n'Totally artificial'\nBeazley\nDavid H. Davis, professor of political science at the University of Toledo, said the fiscal cliff is \"totally artificial.\"\n\"It was put in because Congress thought it would be a way to force itself to do something,\" Davis said. \"We automatically lose the Bush tax cuts. But we don't have to. We could extend them for six months, a year or four years.\n\"There are mandatory cuts divided equally between military and civilian. That's all artificial. It could"

He believes the year-end deal on the fiscal cliff signaled the debt crisis will be addressed in a significant way this year.But for that to happen, Gregg said in an interview, President Barack Obama must begin to \"engage and show leadership.\"Although we remain \"on a path to bankruptcy,\" Gregg said if Obama gets serious about negotiating with Republicans, \"you're going to get some sort of major agreement on entitlements and tax reform, which are the last two legs of the stool.\"They addressed discretionary spending in the 2011 budget agreement, and in the fiscal cliff deal, they addressed revenues. Now they have entitlements and tax reform ahead of them, and I think both will be done over the course of the year. \"We're getting close, and all we need is some presidential leadership.\"Gregg said the Senate remains generally \"collegial,\" but said the House must find a way to set aside its extremism on both sides.It has become \"a very stratified institution\" of liberals and conservatives who \"do not tolerate compromise,\" said Gregg.\"But governance, by definition, requires compromise, especially when you have divided government, which we almost always have in this country.\"The President has not been willing to step forward and engage on these major fiscal policy issues other than to push for higher taxes on the wealthy and a class warfare agenda,\" said Gregg.Since leaving the Senate, Gregg has been an international adviser for Goldman Sachs and a distinguished fellow addressing classes at Dartmouth College. He has been involved with the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, has appeared on news talk shows and, on a personal note, has twice become a grandfather, which he calls \"great fun.\"He is a co-chair of the nonpartisan \"Fix the Debt\" group, which he said has been having an impact in Washington by promoting a bipartisan approach to the deficit.He said the Simpson-Bowles plan, combining spending cuts and entitlement reform with revenue increases, is gaining acceptance as a blueprint. Both former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles and former Sen. Alan Simpson are on the \"Fix the Debt\" board with Gregg.Reflecting on the 2012 campaign, Gregg said Republicans \"marginalized ourselves with independents. Instead of being an expanding tent, we had people out there who were narrowing the tent.\"He would not blame his friend, Mitt Romney, but cited \"the other folks in the primary process\" and \"lackey candidates in places like Indiana and Missouri, who became the face of the party.''\"An election that should have been about fiscal policy, spending and jobs ended up being about social policy,\" he said. \"We looked very harsh, and as a result, our party seriously narrowed our base.\"The former two-term governor said Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan and state lawmakers also face huge challenges.\"We have a very serious unfunded pension liability issue and no one is facing up to it,\" he said. \"We have a very serious problem with our university system not getting the funding it needs and nobody has figured out how to address it.\"We're in need of a Legislature willing to face up to difficult issues, and I don't think people have done that yet,\" he said.Gregg said he is staying out of the race for state Republican Party chair, but said the party should \"get back running on what has historically been our strength, which is fiscal discipline, protection of the environment, individual rights and liberties and home rule. That's what we've always stood for.\""

        "webpage": "brick houseThe Fed was not impressed with Jamie Dimon's \"fortress balance sheet\"\nWritten byMatt Phillips@MatthewPhillips\nIs that fortress strong enough?(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\nJamie Dimon is famous for a lot of things. The hair. The Christmas card. His way with words. And, of course, his \"fortress\" balance sheet.\nLike the financial equivalent of Winterfell, JPMorgan's \"fortress balance sheet\" is an evocative turn of phrase used by Dimon and his lieutenants to describe the sturdy financial foundation of the bank.\nAt the base of that foundation, is a layer of equity - that is, the bank's own money, not money it borrowed - which is supposed to be plush enough to cushion the bank against losses on assets such as securities and loans. In general, the more equity, the safer the bank. For years, JPMorgan's balance sheet has been seen as one of the sturdiest in the US financial system. And phrase \"fortress balance sheet\" is intended to conjure the image of an impregnable citadel, able to withstand a financial crisis with the destructive power of a marauding Dothraki horde.\nExcept that it's not. At least, the Federal Reserve doesn't seem to think it is.\nIn fact, the Federal Reserve says that in order to be considered \"well-capitalized\" going forward, JPMorgan - and all the other large US banks - might have to put more money into its capital cushioning over the next couple years. (This all has to do with the Fed's new new leverage requirements - or to humans, limits on using borrowed money.)\nWhy did JP Morgan not look sufficiently \"well-capitalized\" enough to the Fed? After all, the bank had roughly $211 billion in equity at the end of 2013. That's a lot of money. But is it enough?\nTraditionally, to figure that out, you look at capital as a share of assets. In other words, you look to see how much of a blow the capital cushion would have to withstand if something went wrong.\nAnd this is where what the Fed did was important. The new US rule demands that banks hold the same amount of capital against all of its assets. Banks have long preferred to measure their capital against \"risk-weighted\" assets. When a bank risk-weights assets, it basically tries to describe how risky different assets are, in other words how much of a cushion they deserve. Critics say the the process of risk-weighting assets is too opaque and subject to manipulation and abuse.\nUnder the Fed's proposed new rule, the cushion is measured against all the assets on the bank's books. Perfectly hedged credit default swaps? Throw 'em in. Off-balance sheet entities? Yes. Super safe Treasurys. Yep.\nAnd using that broader measure of assets, the consensus seems to be that JPMorgan needs to add a flying buttress or two to the fortress balance sheet. Credit Suisse analysts think JPM's capital cushion is about $15 billion to skimpy. The New York Times estimated that it was about $30 billion short of the level it would need under the new rules, which don't go into effect until 2018.\nNow in a sense, this isn't really a big deal. JP Morgan can fluff up its capital cushion relatively easily by simply retaining a bit more of its earnings than usual. (It could also meet the leverage ratio by cutting back on some of its assets here and there.) But in another way it is a very big deal.\nThe Fed's new leverage ratios mean that, going forward, it won't be enough just to tell people you have a \"fortress balance sheet.\" You'll really have to show it. And that's a major step to a safer financial system."

Kuwait was virtually unchanged at 7.9% against 8.0% last year, while Saudi Arabia saw an increase to 7.7% from 6.5% the previous year.\n\nAcross the GCC, sectors enjoying the highest pay rise were construction, banking and energy - consistent with the last two years' results and reflecting the sectors' continued strong growth. Healthcare and education registered the lowest increases.\n\nAmong job categories, engineers and finance staff received the biggest pay rises, followed by human resource professionals in third place. Historically under-represented in the region, the HR function has recently been catapulted to the front line as Gulf-based employers grapple with the challenge of attracting, developing and retaining staff.\n\nKey Drivers\n\nGulfTalent.com's study highlighted continued economic growth and intense competition for talent as key drivers of pay rises, along with spiralling living costs in parts of the region, particularly Qatar and the UAE, as well as large pay rises awarded to government employees in some GCC countries.\n\nIt also showed that the continuing depreciation of dollar-pegged regional currencies was diminishing the value of Gulf compensation packages for European expatriates, putting further upward pressure on salaries. Kuwait's decision earlier this year to drop the US dollar peg and the subsequent 3% appreciation of its currency are increasing the competitiveness of Kuwaiti salaries relative to its neighbours and may intensify the pressure on other GCC countries to follow suit, it said.\n\nOther drivers of pay increase highlighted in GulfTalent.com's report were continued economic growth and rising salaries in India, traditionally the main supplier of expatriate workforce to Gulf countries, as well as the easing of laws in some GCC states regarding expatriates changing employment. With government controls no longer protecting employers against staff attrition, many are forced to raise pay levels to retain their employees.\n\nEconomic Impact of Staff Shortages\n\nSeveral executives interviewed by GulfTalent.com complained that, while market demand was extremely healthy, skills shortages were limiting their companies' ability to grow, forcing them to turn down new business or, in some cases, causing them to miss targets on their existing projects. The study warned that, if continued, this could limit overall growth in the non-oil sector of the economy, hampering the region's plans to diversify away from oil.\n\nGulfTalent.com's research also found that smaller, less well established companies faced the greatest pressure, often unable to compete with pay packages offered by larger firms. The long-term impact for the market could be to impede growth of start-up companies, lead to smaller companies merging with larger enterprises and discourage new entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nThe survey further revealed that, as the supply of skilled staff from traditional markets such as India and Egypt diminished, many employers were looking to new sources such as China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. At the same time, staff shortages were forcing companies to outsource more of their operations or to switch to other processes and technologies that are less manpower-intensive.\n\nGulfTalent.com's study was based on a survey of 18,000 professionals in the six GCC countries, as well as interviews with regional business leaders and human resource managers."

Feb. 5 2013 1:41 PM\nDell's Gigantic Tax Dodge\nThe biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisis is more about accounting than business strategy.\nDell Chairman and CEO Michael Dell Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The proposed leveraged buyout of Dell by its own founder and CEO is making headlines largely for its sheer size. Michael Dell, in partnership with private equity fund Silver Lake Partners and with financing from Microsoft and four banks, is proposing a $23 billion buyout of the computer company. One of the largest buyouts on record and by far the largest since the financial crisis, the Dell deal would be the clearest sign yet that the financial system is back. But more interesting than the financing is the reason for the deal: It is essentially a large-scale tax-avoidance scheme.\nLeveraged buyouts have long been a controversial topic, and Mitt Romney's presidential bid put them in the partisan spotlight. But these deals vary widely according to circumstance. Where some see \"vulture capitalists\" destroying firms and lives, others see a much-needed mechanism to bring greater efficiency and new management to troubled enterprises.\nThe Dell deal is striking in this regard because the key mover is already the CEO, founder, and largest shareholder in the firm. In other words, while Michael Dell may have some new ideas about how the company should be managed, the deal is clearly not about wresting control of the brand from mismanaging incumbents. The idea is to keep the same leadership team in place, and rejigger the company's financial structure rather than its way of doing business.\nAdvertisement The main function of taking a company public is to give early investors and employees a way to turn their shares into money. Subsequent trading lets secondary investors - and executives with stock options - get paid as well. As long as a company is growing rapidly and its share price keeps rising, the stock market keeps performing this function admirably. People who are paid partially in shares (or who have shares from previous payments) can cash out into a rising market. The problem arises when, as with Dell, your firm enters a period of market stagnation.\nDell's basic business problem is obvious. The PC market is shrinking in the face of the rising popularity of tablets and smartphones, and incumbent PC makers are seeing their profit margins challenged by new entrants such as Asus and Lenovo. Dell's hope is to imitate IBM's successful transformation into a software and services company. But IBM's turnaround is such a famous business story precisely because it's rare and difficult, and not something that Dell can obviously repeat. Meanwhile, Dell, as it currently exists, continues to be a profitable company, and thanks to past profits, it also has a lot of cash on its books - much of it squirreled away offshore to avoid taxes.\nAnd here's the rub. Dell's cash stockpile and current profits ought to make it a valuable company despite its poor growth outlook. But before those profits or cash holdings can be paid out to shareholders as dividends, they would have to be \"repatriated\" to the United States. Then a 35 percent corporate income tax would be levied, and only then would shareholders get their money.\nA leverage buyout offers a workaround to avoid many of these taxes. Shareholders make money directly as their shares are bought back at a premium. Much of the money that would go to buy the shares would be borrowed from banks, who'll earn a profit of interest payments. Those interest payments can be made, in part, with the repatriated cash. Except this time the cash would not be taxed, since interest payments on corporate debt are a tax-deductible expense. Like magic, Dell's shareholders would be extracting money from the firm without giving Uncle Sam nearly as big a cut.\nTo say that's all there is to the deal would be an exaggeration. Obviously Michael Dell sincerely hopes that freeing himself from the distractions of monitoring day-to-day stock fluctuations will better help him execute his pivot, but tax arbitrage is a huge part of the story. This important aspect of private equity's role in American finance is somewhere between the heroic job creator image and the life-destroying vulture capitalist one. Huge sums of money are involved and structuring the deals is complicated work, but it's essentially the banal work of accounting helping a company maximize its tax deductions. Reforming the corporate income-tax code to feature lower rates and fewer loopholes so that less time and energy are wasted on this kind of thing is something everyone in Washington says they want to do but somehow never seem to get done. Until they do, expect to see more eye-popping deals that are basically about financial engineering rather than business strategy.

        "webpage": "2-23-12 Download the audio of Capital Comments: MP3, WMV\nA Look Behind the Numbers of Six Unemployment Rates\nEach month the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics releases new data on the unemployment rate. January numbers were released on Feb. 3; excitement ensued. The unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a point, to 8.3 percent. That's down from 9 percent in September. Perhaps the recovery is finally gaining momentum.\nThe \"official\" unemployment rate represents the number of people without jobs who are looking for work as a percentage of the labor force. The labor force is the total number of people who have jobs, plus the unemployed - those who are working or want to be. Sometimes this official rate is said to underestimate the employment troubles people are having. Sometimes it's made to sound like a BLS cover-up of the economy's problems. This bugs me, because the BLS publishes several different unemployment rates that give a more detailed picture of what's going on. If you want to claim that things are worse than they seem, the BLS has a number for you.\nBLS news releases are at . Scroll down to Employment Situation; this links to the latest data tables. Table A-15, Alternate Measures of Labor Underutilization, shows six unemployment rates. The first is the number of people who have been unemployed for 15 weeks or more as a percentage of the labor force. The rate was 4.9 percent in January 2012. These are folks who have been looking for work for a long time. Household finance experts recommend you have an emergency fund equal to three to six months of household expenses. People without jobs for 15 weeks would be pretty close to depleting such a fund. They may be facing serious financial trouble. The 4.9 percent rate represents a lot of long-term unemployment. To see this, check the list of tables again. At the bottom of the page is a link to historical data for the \"A\" tables. Follow the link to table A-15. On the first line, check one or both boxes on the right for seasonally adjusted or non-seasonally adjusted data, and then click \"retrieve data\" at the bottom. You can view data as far back as 1948. Long-term unemployment peaked at 5.9 percent in April 2010. That was the highest number in any month since 1948. Since there was probably little long-term unemployment during World War II, it's likely that 5.9 percent has been the highest since the Great Depression.\nThe rate has dropped a bit, but it's still very high. And although prospects are improving, a lot of people are already in serious financial trouble.\nThe next unemployment rate on the list is \"Job losers and persons who completed temporary jobs\" as a percentage of the labor force. The rate is 4.7 percent. These are people whose jobs have disappeared. The rest of the current 8.3 percent unemployment rate represents people who left their jobs voluntarily (but the jobs didn't disappear) and people who were out of the labor force and are now re-entering. They didn't have jobs to lose.\nThe job-losers rate rises when the economy enters a recession and falls when a recovery gets going. This rate was 6.5 percent in October 2009, so the rate is improving. Fewer jobs are disappearing. During the economic expansion years in the early 2000s, the rate dropped as low as 2.1 percent. At 4.7 percent, the rate is not where we want it to be.\nThe last three rates on the BLS list are higher than the official unemployment rate. The highest rate is 15.1 percent. It includes everyone who is officially unemployed and discouraged workers who want a job but have quit looking, because they don't think they'll find one, and people who are working part time but would rather be working full time. The rate represents all the workers who would like to be working more than they are.\nThis rate peaked at 17.2 percent in October 2009. It was 8 percent in early 2007. Again, it's better than it was but far from where we want it to be.\nThe employment report for February will be released March 9. Watch the official rate to see if it comes down again. But take a look at the other measures, too. Will the long-term unemployed get some relief? Will fewer jobs disappear? Will discouraged workers and part-time workers catch a break? Those things have to happen for our recovery to really get going. Writer: Larry DeBoer"

According to World Bank projections, global remittances will reach $515 billion in 2015. Developing countries receive the lion's share of global remittances, and in 25 countries, remittances were equal to more than 10 percent of gross domestic product as of 2011.

Bush (R) greets Chinese President Hu Jintao at the G20 Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy at the National Building Museum in Washington, November 15, 2008. [Agencies]\nHu outlined four areas for reform:\n* Strengthening international cooperation in financial regulation and improving international regulatory mechanisms.\n* Advancing reform of international financial institutions as well as the representation mechanism in the decision-making process in international financial organizations.\n* Encouraging regional financial cooperation and enhancing the role of a regional assistance funding mechanism.\n* Reforming the international currency system and steadily pushing forward the diversification of the international currency regime.\nRelated readings:\nG20 to revive economy, reshape financial architecture\nWorld leaders urge fast action on financial crisis\nFM: G20 summit 'significant' for world to tackle financial crisis\nBush hails G20 summit, leaves more work behind\nHu also called for international efforts to help developing and least developed countries cope with the global financial crisis. \"The international community should pay particular attention to the damage to developing countries, especially the least developed countries, and do all it can to minimize the damage.\"\nChina, as the world's largest developing country, will maintain \"steady and relatively fast growth\" as an important contribution to tackling the worst crisis since the 1930s, Hu said.\n\"The Chinese government has adopted measures to boost economic development, including lowering the required reserve ratio, cutting deposit and lending rates, and easing the corporate tax burden,\" Hu said.\nThe country \"has taken an active part in international cooperation to deal with the financial crisis and played a positive role in maintaining international financial stability and promoting the development of the world economy\", he said.\nChina unveiled a 4-trillion-yuan ($586 billion) economic stimulus package on Nov 9 to boost its economy, which in the third quarter decelerated to the slowest growth rate over the past five years.\nAnalysts said it may take a long time for the reform of the international financial system to materialize despite possible fine-tuning in the near term.\nAs the US economy remains the largest in the world and would not lose its pre-eminence in the short term, the current international financial structure may continue for \"quite some time\", said Zhang Jun, director of Fudan University's China Center for Economic Studies. \"The financial structure is basically determined by the economic prowess of its members.\"\nConcrete plans for the proposed reform are not ready, Zhao Xijun, finance professor of Renmin University of China, said.\nThe basic structure of the international financial regime will remain unchanged, but there will be some changes in such issues as closer cooperation in better regulating the markets, he said.\n\"Hedge funds, investment banks and other intermediary bodies in the developed world have played a dubious role in triggering the current crisis,\" he said. \"They will be made more transparent.\""

        "webpage": "What the Obama campaign can learn from Newt Gingrich\nBy Jamelle Bouie\nKey to the Obama campaign's attacks on Bain Capital is the idea that the company was shirking its responsibilities to workers. We're supposed to see Bain as a ruthless, profit-making enterprise with little concern for the lives of workers or the livelihood of a community. Implicit to the critique is that if Bain (and Mitt Romney) actually cared about creating jobs and improving the economy, it could have found ways to build wealth without closing factories and putting hundreds out of work.\nThis, however, is an odd conception of private equity. Bain's job wasn't to protect workers; it was to create the most wealth for shareholders under the least amount of risk. At times, this was terrible for workers, but it fundamentally wasn't a concern. The Obama campaign's exclusive focus on factory closings might play well in manufacturing states like Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, but it also opens Obama to the charge that he is waging an attack on \"free enterprise.\" It's unfair, given the extent to which Obama has run a business-friendly administration (to the frustration of many progressives), but it has the potential for traction, since the Bain attack is centered on the destruction involved in the generation of wealth.\nBut there's a way to account for this, and for that, we should look to Newt Gingrich's campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. With the primaries over, Gingrich might insist that he failed with his attacks on Bain Capital, but that's clearly not true; together with his debate performances, his attacks earned him a decisive victory in the South Carolina Republican primary.\nGingrich's approach to Bain differed in the emphasis; rather than focus (exclusively) on the plight of workers, Gingrich challenged the idea that Romney was engaged in traditional, risk-taking capitalism. Instead, Gingrich argued in a news conference in January, Romney was a \"vulture capitalist\" who did more to extract wealth than create it:\n\"You have to ask the question, is capitalism really about the ability of a handful of rich people to manipulate the lives of thousands of people and then walk off with the money?\" ...\nThe former Speaker is making the case that, in contrast to good old fashioned businesses who make stuff, Romney and his ilk have instead gamed the system to create a soulless machine that profits from the misery of others....\n\"I am totally for capitalism, I am for free markets,\" Gingrich assured reporters on Monday. \"Nobody objects to Bill Gates being extraordinarily rich, they provide a service.\" What he instead is concerned about is when an investor receives \"six-to-one returns, and the company goes bankrupt.\"\nThe problem with Bain in the Gingrich narrative is that it made bad bets and escaped unscathed. With Ampad, for example, Bain amassed huge amounts of debt, paid $.002 for every dollar owed, and walked away with a $100 million return on its $5 million investment, even as it laid off hundreds of workers.\nAs Gingrich discovered, this resonates with voters, who don't begrudge the wealthy but are angered that someone could take huge risks, fail and walk away with profit. Indeed, it's the same disdain for golden parachutes that turned TARP into a political liability for President Obama, even if it was responsible for keeping the United States out of a second Great Depression.\nThere's no reason for the Obama campaign to abandon its focus on workers, but it should also take a page from Gingrich and level its guns at Romney's core argument that he is the embodiment of free enterprise. If it can portray Bain as something distinct from capitalism as popularly understood, the Obama campaign might find more traction with its attacks. By Jamelle Bouie"

        "webpage": "Prophets and Losses\nNow that the federal government is playing an ever larger role in the economy, a look at Washington's track record seems to be long overdue.\nThe recent release of the Federal Reserve Board's transcripts of its deliberations back in 2007 shows that their economic prophecies were way off. How much faith should we put in their prophecies today  -  or the policies based on those prophecies?\nEven after the housing market began its collapse in 2006, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in 2007, \"The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained.\"\nIt turned out that financial disasters in the housing market were not \"contained,\" but spread out to affect the whole American economy and economies overseas. Then Chairman Bernanke said: \"It is an interesting question why what looks like $100 billion or so of credit losses in the subprime market has been reflected in multiple trillions of dollars of losses in paper wealth.\"\nWhat is an even more interesting question is why we should put such faith and such power in the hands of a man and an institution that have been so wrong before.\nThis is not just a question of a bad guess by Ben Bernanke. The previous chairman of the Federal Reserve System, Alan Greenspan, likewise misjudged the consequences of the housing boom and bust. Nor was the Federal Reserve's staff any more accurate in its prophecies. According to the New York Times, \"The Fed's own staff still forecast that the economy would avoid a recession.\"\nToday, the economy has not yet fully recovered from the recession that the Federal Reserve System's staff and chairmen thought we would avoid.\nWe all make mistakes. But we don't all have the enormous and growing power of the Federal Reserve System  -  or the seemingly boundless confidence that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke still shows as he intervenes in the economy on a massive scale.\nNot only does the Federal Reserve System control the money supply and regulate banks, the Fed's willingness to keep buying hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of government bonds makes it easier for the Obama administration to keep engaging in massive deficit spending that runs up a record-breaking national debt.\nThe reason that the Federal Reserve can afford to continue buying huge amounts of government bonds is that the Fed is authorized to create its own money out of thin air. They use the fancy term \"quantitative easing,\" instead of saying in plain English that they are essentially just printing more money.\nBeing wrong is nothing new for the Federal Reserve System. Since this year is the one hundredth anniversary of the Fed's founding, it may be worth looking back at its history.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson explained the reasons for creating the Federal Reserve System. He said that the Federal Reserve \"provides a currency which expands as it is needed and contracts when it is not needed\" and that \"the power to direct this system of credits is put into the hands of a public board of disinterested officers of the Government itself\" to avoid control by private bankers or other special interests.\nThe Federal Reserve was supposed to prevent shocks to the economy that can come from drastic inflation or deflation, and reduce the dangers that can come from widespread bank failures. These are all good goals. But what is the Fed's track record?\nIn the hundred years before there was a Federal Reserve System, inflation was less than half of what it became in the hundred years after the Fed was founded. The biggest deflation in the history of the country came after the Fed was founded, and that deflation contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s. As for bank failures, they reached levels unheard of before there was a Federal Reserve System.\nLike so many \"progressives,\" then and now, Woodrow Wilson seemed to think that, if those who made government decisions had no financial interest in those decisions, then they could be trusted to wield their powers in the public interest.\nBut the enormous power wielded by the unelected leaders of the Fed over the economy, unchecked by the constraints of the market, has repeatedly turned out to be more than human beings can handle.\nThomas Sowell is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.

Trade in intermediates has now surpassed trade in final goods and services, and global trade is increasingly conducted in the form of tasks instead of final products. These shifts require a paradigm shift in policy-making.\nLike many other nations, Indonesia aspires to improve its position in GVCs by moving towards higher value-adding activities.

Some of its winning projects involve such typical treasury activities as hedging investments, integrating the treasuries of acquisitions and streamlining treasury technology. But Google also won for its investments in renewable energy and for the credit card it is testing as a way of supporting the small and midsize businesses that buy ads.\nBrent Callinicos, Google's treasurer, and Patrick Pichette, the Internet giant's CFO and senior vice president, say the range of work reflects the culture of the company as a whole and the premium it puts on innovation.\nWhile the treasury group handles the traditional obligations of overseeing cash and managing risk, Pichette says, \"every element of Google is expected to innovate and I expect the same out of the treasury group. It's treasury-plus.\"\nCallinicos says part of what attracted him to Google was that the company rejects doing things a certain way just because that's the way they've always been done. \"Whatever's logical is what we'll do.\" he says. \"Logic I always say is the filter of what happens here, along with passion.\"\nOne of the areas Callinicos is passionate about is clean energy, and for the second year in a row, Google has taken the Gold Award in the Best Green Strategy category. Its award last year was for an innovative method of purchasing energy from a wind farm. Now Google has moved on to investing in green energy generation, with commitments to date of $915 million.\nInvesting in renewable energy projects makes use not only of Google's balance sheet, but its energy expertise, Pichette notes. \"Because we have an engineering team at Google that understands these technologies very, very well, we have in a way a great advantage to analyze like very few people can, the real risk profile for these projects.\"\nThe green investments are in line with Google's desire to be carbon-neutral and to facilitate new technologies, Pichette says, but they're also a financial plus, providing the company with power at favorable rates and investments that are likely to yield a higher return.\nWith regard to the credit card project, Callinicos notes that at a time when financial institutions are wary of lending, Google has a healthy balance sheet, as well as lots of data on its customers. \"This is a good way to leverage treasury expertise,\" he says, adding, \"Treasury needs to think more broadly about what treasury can do for a company, whether they have large amounts of cash or not.\"\nInnovation can mean that the lines between different units of Google blur, Callinicos acknowledges, noting that in addition to overseeing treasury, he's also responsible for accounting and tax. \"At this point in time, I have the treasurer title and the chief accountant title.

Balancing Safety and Return\nSome treasuries have extended out the yield curve to pick up yield, but they're likely to reverse those moves when Fed tightening seems imminent.\nBy Susan Kelly November 11, 2013 \u2022 Reprints\nStubbornly low short-term interest rates have encouraged some corporate treasurers to reach for more yield by moving to longer-term investments or those with slightly lower credit quality. But the prevailing mode still seems to be caution, according to bankers and investment managers, with treasury teams putting a premium on safety rather than yield.\nTo the extent that companies have invested farther out the curve, they're likely to unwind those investments before short-term rates begin to rise.\nThe extent of the caution among corporate treasuries is evident in the Association for Financial Professionals' 2013 Liquidity Survey, released in July, which showed 50% of companies' cash is in bank deposits, up from 25% in 2008.\n\"What we continue to see is a strong emphasis and desire to leave cash on deposit,\" said Fred Berretta, head of the global liquidity investment solutions team at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"If you look at the last five years, as rates shifted, the deposit option has really become and remained the most attractive short-term liquidity vehicle in the market.\"\nCompanies that invest in short-term securities have \"a strong and continuing emphasis on Treasuries,\" Berretta said, but noted that the partial government shutdown in October caused some companies to shift out of T-bills into deposits or money funds.\nSome more sophisticated companies, those with capital that they know they won't need to access immediately, have shown more comfort in investments \"with a tenor of three months, six months, nine months, a year,\" Berretta said. He also noted interest in separately managed accounts, portfolios that are managed for a single company. \"It's one way to eke out slightly greater yields, but to do that in a prudent manner,\" he said.\nBut corporate treasurers still face three major sources of uncertainty when it comes to short-term investing: the outlook for Fed policy, the outlook for the economy, and the Securities and Exchange Commission's proposed regulations for money-market funds, Berretta said. \"That's a wild card, because the money fund is an incredibly popular vehicle for many of these investors. Once that's off the table, you are going to see some evolution in the way these working capital investors behave.\"\nBrandon Semilof, a managing director at StoneCastle Partners, an asset management company, said that while safety remains important, \"I think that people are somewhat frustrated by the fact that we've been in a zero percent interest-rate environment for five years.\"\nSemilof said that over the past couple of years, treasurers have tried to do a better job of dividing their cash between what they"

        "webpage": "Sen. Osten among those seeking IRA for low-income workers, self-employed\nHartford  -  Labor advocates and state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, announced Tuesday that they will push for a new state-administered trust fund to give low-income private sector workers and self-employed people access to an individual retirement account.Osten said the retirement system would be based on contributions made by the workers and would not call for contributions from the state or employers. The cost to employees would be low because administrative fees would be lower than those of plans currently offered in the private market, advocates said.The provisions in the new legislative bill would be based on Senate Bill 54 from last year, Osten said.If passed, the new trust fund would be called the Connecticut Retirement Security Trust Fund. The proposal calls for it to be managed by a board chaired by the state treasurer and comptroller.About 740,000 Connecticut residents are not enrolled in an employer-provided retirement plan, according to a report by the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis, cited by advocates for the plan.Dorry Clay of Stonington, who owns a one-person graphic design company, said she has had no feasible way to save for her retirement. She said she has been an artist all her life but started the business after losing her job during the recession. She was diagnosed with cancer, which wiped out her savings.\"I don't want to have to work until I am 70 or older because I can't afford to retire,\" she said. \"The public retirement plan is an absolute no-brainer.\"Employers with five or more employees would be required to offer employees a payroll deduction option to join the trust program.The default employee contribution would not be less than 3 percent of their salary, under the provisions of last year's bill being proposed as a model.When asked whether the state should start up a retirement plan for private employees after managing its public pensions so poorly, Osten said yes.\"This publicly run retirement fund would not require an employer piece to it, and therefore, would not have that piece of the problem that has happened,\" Osten said.The state's two main public pension systems, one for teachers and one for state employees, are funded at 55 percent and 42 percent of their anticipated obligations, respectively. Experts say pension systems should be funded at 80 to 100 percent.Sal Luciano, executive director of the Council for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) said the proposed public retirement plan would be at low cost to individual participants because there would be a large number of participants. Participants would have access to financial planners, he said, and would pay fees of about 0.5 percent of their retirement contributions.He compared that to a fee of 2.6 percent for some private plans.Joshua Gottfried, founder and principal of Gottfried & Somberg Wealth Management LLC in Glastonbury, said there are already low-cost retirement investment options such as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, which has more than $155 billion in assets, charges 0.17 percent and has a $15 annual fee.\"Why create a new product when knowledge is what is needed?\" he said. \"The products already exist.\"When last year's version of the bill was brought before the Appropriations Committee, several Republicans questioned why the state would create a plan when there are others already in the marketplace. They said that they would prefer the state create a marketing plan to encourage people to save for retirement instead of starting its own"

        "webpage": "More Jobs, But Wait: They May Not Pay Much By Sonari Glinton\nOriginally published on May 4, 2013 11:53 am Transcript SCOTT SIMON, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. The economy added 165,000 jobs in April. That exceeded the expectations of economists. It also drove down the unemployment rate to a four-year low, 7.5 percent. Unfortunately, the biggest gains were in lower-paying fields like hospitality and temp agencies. And as the school year comes to a close and young people start looking, the question is will there be enough work for them. NPR's Sonari Glinton reports. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Wall Street got pretty excited about the jobs numbers. The Department of Labor went back and revised the last two months' numbers, stocks were up and all was right with the world. OK - maybe not. LOUIS HYMAN: But when you start to dig deeper and start to tease apart the numbers, you get a very different picture of what's going on in the economy. GLINTON: Louis Hyman teaches at Cornell University, and he says while those who got full-time work went up by 165,000, there's another number he's looking at. HYMAN: Well, the people who are working part-time jobs is increasing by almost 300,000. So, you know, what we're starting to see in these numbers is not a recovery of full-time, good, stable work, the way we think work should be, but an economy of temps, waiters and people stringing together part-time gigs. GLINTON: All right. Here's the thing: there are nearly eight million people who are working part-time but want to be working full-time. Hyman says those jobs are often jobs that would have normally been taken by teenagers. HYMAN: Are now taken by people who are in their 30s and their 40s, people who are being laid off and looking for work and so their crowding out those younger workers, with a, I think, a long-term effect on the formation of jobs skills for younger people. GLINTON: If you want to see this effect on young people you need only seek out your nearest group of teenagers. (SOUNDBITE OF SKATEBOARDING) GLINTON: Those closest groups to me was at Hamilton High in Los Angeles. Darian Hall is a senior and she's finally gotten a job after looking for years. She works at Best Buy. She says not working through most of high school has taught her to save her money. DARIAN HALL: Prom's coming up soon, so, you know, I have to buy a prom dress. And, like, I don't want to be, like, on my mom, like, oh my god, can you help me buy this? Like, I want to do stuff on my own kind of, be a little bit independent. GLINTON: Hall says she volunteered before finally finding a job. She says the thing that was stressing her out was getting work experience - any work experience. HALL: It's not going to be as hard anymore since I have work experience, 'cause that's what they really look for mostly. And if you don't have work experience, then it's kind of like what are you doing-ish kind of, yeah. GLINTON: Hall's friend Kyanna Holness says she can't find a part-time job but she'll take what she can get. KYANNA HOLNESS: It doesn't really matter. Like, she said, it's like mostly, I'm looking for work experience, like, I'm not afraid to work for free 'cause, you know, in this economy it's kind of hard to find a good-paying job, especially if you're 17. BILL RODGERS: In an economy where we're just barely keeping pace in terms of population growth that prosperity is going to be very slow to come to young people. GLINTON: Bill Rodgers is an economist at Rutgers University. He says not only are young people competing with adults for part-time work... RODGERS: ...since you have these adults working in jobs that are below their capacity, true capacity, there's less income, less earnings, less tax revenue going into the economy and which then translates into fewer jobs - spillover jobs - that would go to teens. GLINTON: Rodgers says that one of the biggest factors that could affect young people is if the economy takes a hit because of government cuts, referred to as sequestration. He says the effects of the cuts on the economy are likely to show up in June and July when young people are entering the workforce. RODGERS: I'm very nervous about this summer for young people, especially for young minority teens who have unemployment rates that are well in excess of 20 percent. And then if you go in some urban areas, they even have unemployment rates, you know, in the 30, 40 percent. GLINTON: Which Rodgers says will not only affect those young people's jobs prospects in the future but our overall economy for years to come. Sonari Glinton, NPR News.

        "webpage": "And it is an art, as Silver -- the proprietor of the New York Times's FiveThirtyEight political blog -- makes abundantly clear. When it comes to successful forecasting, he shows that knowing what to ignore is at least as important as knowing what to consider.\nJust as vital, he argues, is being willing to embrace rather than ignore the uncertainties inherent in trying to foretell the future. And if that means the resulting prediction is a little less sure of itself than we're used to hearing from our expert class, well, so be it. Silver first came to prominence among a subset of baseball statheads with Pecota, a system for projecting players' performance (the name being a retroactive acronym constructed to recognize Bill Pecota, a marginal infielder who used to torment Silver's favored Detroit Tigers).\nPredicting PedroiaPecota had some notable successes, including tagging Boston Red Sox prospect Dustin Pedroia as a future star when few scouts would have agreed. But it had some notable misses too -- and Silver, to his credit, not only talks about them but draws the larger lesson:\n\"The key to making a good forecast,\" he says, \"is not in limiting yourself to quantitative information. Rather, it's having a good process for weighing the information appropriately.\"\nThat task is made infinitely more difficult by the vast amounts of information available. The trick is in separating the knowable from the unknowable and the relevant from the irrelevant, and in recognizing the difference between correlation and causation. Ice-cream sales and forest fires both peak in the summer, he notes. \"But there is no causation; you don't light a patch of the Montana brush on fire when you buy a pint of Haagen-Dazs.\"\nIndeed, Silver finds common threads between our predictive failures when it comes to natural disasters and man-made ones.\nIn a chapter called \"How to Drown in Three Feet of Water,\" he skips blithely from the failings of economic forecasters -- most of whom not only failed to predict the recessions of 1990, 2001 and 2007, but didn't even recognize them after they had already begun -- to the 1997 Red River floods in North Dakota, then back again.\nIntellectual LeapsThose intellectual leaps are some of the most interesting things about \"The Signal and the Noise,\" and some of the most annoying. Silver is clearly a smart guy, and is refreshingly free of the glibness and smugness that can creep into the work of \"Freakonomics\" authors Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner.\nYet it can be exhausting to follow the twists and turns of his mental gymnastics. Perhaps we could have made do with a shorter account of how International Business Machines Corp.'s chess-playing Deep Blue computer spooked world champion Garry Kasparov, or a little less on the various strains of flu that never triggered a pandemic. Both the book and the reader would have benefited from fewer somersaults and more editorial focus.\nAnd for a guy who really made his reputation in politics -- his 2008 model successfully forecast the presidential outcomes in 49 of the 50 states -- there's surprisingly little on the subject in \"The Signal and the Noise.\"\nEnforcing DisciplineFor that, we have to turn to Silver's blog -- a form that, with its short-attention-span conventions, may actually prove better at enforcing literary discipline than the bigger canvas of a 454-page-plus-footnotes book.\nStill, Silver displays a knack not just for mining data but for explaining his thinking in an accessible manner. It's nice to come across someone as insightful as he is who doesn't seem completely dazzled by his own brilliance.\n\"Our bias is to think we are better at prediction than we really are,\" he concludes, hoping for a future in which we're \"a little more modest about our forecasting abilities, and a little less likely to repeat our mistakes.\"\n\"The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail -- But Some Don't\" is published by Penguin Press (534 pages, $27.95).

        "webpage": "Obama decides not to extend term of jobs council\nBy JOSH LEDERMANAssociated Press\nGeneral Electric Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt listens at right as President Barack Obama meets with the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. WASHINGTON, D.C.  -  President Barack Obama is letting his jobs council expire, cutting off one source of input from business leaders while unemployment remains stubbornly high.\nObama formed the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in January 2011, when unemployment was about 9 percent. It's now 7.8 percent, though more than 12 million people are out of work.\nObama's executive order establishing the council said it would go out of business Jan. 31, 2013. The White House said Thursday that Obama had no plans to renew its charter.\n\"The work of the jobs council was very valuable,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \"While the president didn't agree with all of its recommendations, he agreed with many of them and acted on a number of them.\"\nWhite House officials said Obama intended for the council to fulfill its mission and then wind down, and that he would seek input about the economy from business leaders in other ways. Among the steps Obama plans to pursue are expedited permits for public works projects, plus programs to boost entrepreneurship and workforce development.\nEven before Obama's decision was clear, Republicans seized on the council's likely expiration as evidence the president hadn't spent enough time on trying to create jobs, which is a priority for Americans. The Republican National Committee called it part of \"the failed Obama record,\" while the House Republicans' campaign committee, in an online petition, accused Obama of laying off his own jobs council.\nAdding to the concern about the job market's vulnerability, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December of last year, the first quarterly drop since 2009. The Federal Reserve said the economy appears to have \"paused in recent months.\"\nThe jobs council was a successor to an economic advisory board Obama created at the onset of his presidency. The panel was chaired by General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt and included prominent business leaders and economists. Immelt said Thursday that progress has been made on putting in place 90 percent of the council's recommendations.\nObama met with the council only a few times. During the last meeting, in February 2012, the president and the council highlighted an engineering education initiative alongside school deans.\n\"The president treated his jobs council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nThe council's main product was a report, \"Roadmap to Renewal,\" that was released in January 2012. The council also organized a series of meetings across the country last year with business owners, elected officials and academics; Obama didn't attend those election-year sessions.\nCritics have argued that the council's primary purpose was to create the appearance of action at a time when the nation was pining for something to rein in soaring joblessness. The administration acted on many of the council's recommendations, including suggestions to streamline permitting and small business loans, increase tourist visas and boost energy efficiency.\nBut the White House was at odds with several council members on tax policies, particularly a proposal to exclude overseas corporate earnings from U.S. taxes. That idea divided even the jobs council, whose membership included labor and Obama's political allies.\n\"It was helpful in terms of putting a spotlight on a variety of issues, but particularly helpful in the area of entrepreneurship,\" said AOL co-founder Steve Case, a member of the panel, in an interview. \"There's still work to be done, but we did make good progress.\"\nThe council's dissolution also comes as White House aides are optimistic about the prospects for a second-term detente with business.\nDuring Obama's first term, business leaders bristled at his harsh depiction of \"fat-cat bankers\" and his efforts to impose regulations, tax policies and spending initiatives they argued were unfriendly to business. Obama aides hope the warming of ties between the president and the business world can benefit the White House in future fiscal debates with Republicans.\nWhite House officials said the president made a fresh effort to reach out to business in the days following his re-election. Between the November election and the end of 2012, in the height of negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff,\" more than 400 business leaders, ranging from CEOs of large multinational companies to small business owners, met with Obama or his aides at the White House, officials said."

Securities and Exchange Commission\n450 Fifth Street, NW\nRE: Release Nos. 33-8119; 34-46301\nFile No. S7-30-02\nPlease accept this comment letter from the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (\"NASAA\") in response to the above referenced releases by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\" or the \"Commission\") of a proposed rule for Regulation Analyst Certification (\"Regulation AC\"). NASAA welcomes the opportunity to provide input on this important topic.\nNASAA acknowledges the Commission and in particular the Division of Market Regulation for developing and proposing for comment Regulation AC. NASAA also recognizes the NYSE and NASD for developing Rules 472 and 2711, respectively, which were approved by the Commission earlier this year. The requirements of these rules include among others, prohibitions against tying analyst compensation to specific investment banking transactions and to favorable research reports to induce business; trading restrictions for companies followed by the analyst; and increased disclosure of conflicts of interest. NASAA, whose primary mission is the protection of \"Main Street\" individual investors, is of the opinion these rules, augmented by additional safeguards1 are essential components in establishing a \"level playing field\" for all investors.\nThe intent of the Commission's proposed rule is to address concerns relating to an analyst's independence and objectivity. As the recent market decline has indicated, consumer confidence has been eroded by accounting scandals, questionable research reports and other investment banking abuses. Although our trading markets are the most transparent and efficient in the world, it seems essential that additional regulation be instituted to insure the return of consumer confidence. Respectfully, however, NASAA cannot agree that Regulation AC advances the cause of investor protection to any significant degree.\nAs SEC Market Regulation Chief Annette Nazareth stated at the open meeting where SRO rules 472 and 2711 were adopted in May of this year, it is securities fraud for an analyst to lie about his or her opinion of a security in providing analysis for public dissemination.2 It has been unlawful, as a federal matter, to make such untrue statements at least since adoption of Rule 10(b) and for a longer period under many blue-sky laws. It is unlawful today as we consider Regulation AC, and it will continue to be securities fraud whether or not the Commission acts favorably on the proposed rule. We submit, further, that there is little or no, prophylactic effect to be expected by requiring an otherwise untruthful analyst to \"certify\" that he or she is telling the truth.\nIndeed, the certification requirement can be misread to indicate that pre-Regulation AC statements are subject to a lesser standard of truthfulness, since the Commission apparently feels compelled to adopt the additional requirement of certification. Why would the Commission otherwise pursue such a rule?\nFinally, we are concerned that Research Analysts are being singled out as easy-to-hit and defenseless targets for all of the ills of the recent market bubble. Of course, some analysts were not innocents, as revelations by New York Attorney General Spitzer and Massachusetts Secretary of State Galvin make clear. But it is equally clear that the problem is greater than untruthful analysts, alone. Perhaps it would be appropriate for investment banking managers and traders and even heads of firms to certify that they never offered monetary incentives to analysts for favorable reports and were unaware that such inducements were practices of their firms.\nBecause we do not believe that Regulation AC increases the likelihood of truthfulness of analysts reports, because it can be read to unsettle questions about the legal status of uncertified lies in the market place and because it deflects attention from inducements by investment bankers and traders who richly deserve to have their hour in the spotlight, we believe the SEC's resources would be better served by focusing on more tangible problems, such as \"road shows\", \"booster shots\", and retaliation against honest analysts. If the SEC, however, determines that Regulation AC is appropriate and should be adopted, we strongly urge the Commission to specify that the rule is only meant to clarify existing fraud standards, not to create new ones. Further, \"functional regulation\" requires and NASAA strongly urges that Regulation AC's provisions apply to debt analysts, investment advisers, and employees of banks and insurance companies whose activities are similar to equity analysts associated with broker dealers. Very Truly Yours,\nJoseph Borg, President\n1 See, for example, NASAA's recommendations in its August 12, 2001 letter to the NASD in response to NASD Request for Comment to NTM 01-45 and testimony by Professor John C. Coffee, Jr. before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, March 5, 2002.\n2 See also, Lori Richards, SEC Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations proclaiming \"I note that existing antifraud rules prohibit making statements that the speaker knows not to be true that would be fraud, plain and simple.\" (Excerpt from May 8, 2002 Speech to the Financial Women's Association New York, NY)."

        "webpage": "Wage purchasing power is growing\n\nIn line with our forecasts, the annual rise in average salary remained moderate (4.2%). With inflation possibly reaching the lowest level, salaries are growing increasingly rapidly in real terms: in the first quarter of 2013 by 3.8%. However, even this rather substantial increase in income poses no threat to price stability and economic competitiveness. The balance between salaries and productivity remains the case.\n\nThe increase in productivity in the first quarter of 2013 calculated according to the official statistics, could be ill-assessed because of the overvaluation of employment data. According to the labour force survey conducted by the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB), employment grew 4.7% year-on-year, which, according to the CSB flash data on GDP growth (3.1%) would mean a drop in productivity by 1.6%. To approximate the results of the labour survey, however, the population as it was at the beginning of 2012 was used (the population at the beginning of 2013, with adjusted migration, is expected to be announced by CSB on 12 June). According to our calculations, that overestimates the number of the employed in the first quarter of 2013 by about ten thousand.\n\nTherefore there is reason to doubt any drop in productivity. We should note that the real increase in employment is still impressive and, in the first quarter of 2013, it could still be among the fastest in the European Union, just as in 2011 and 2012.\n\nOver the last year, the rise in salaries has been similar in both the private and public sectors. Over recent quarters, it has speeded up in the private sector. Salaries have risen in all main branches of the economy. Our wage forecasts remain unchanged: we expect a rise in average salary within the 4-5% range.\n\nIn January 2013, the personal income tax rate on salaries dropped by 1 percentage point (to 24%), therefore the net salary purchasing power grew even more rapidly over the year, by 4.8%. Along with the sustained rise in employment, it is a good support for domestic demand, which can help to protect Latvian businesses from the possible instability in external markets. Without a rise in external demand, however, real wage rise at the existing rate are not sustainable in the long term."

However, he is limited in his ability to offer bold new initiatives because of a budget accord he reached in 2011 with US House of Representatives Republicans that puts strict curbs on both domestic and military spending.An agreement reached in December last year between congressional Republicans and Obama's Democrats allowed a slight easing of curbs on spending in the current 2014 fiscal year, but outlays will be essentially flat in fiscal 2015, which begins on Oct. 1.Because of the caps, spending on programs subject to annual review next year will total US$1.014 trillion compared to US$1.012 trillion  -  an increase of less than 0.2 percent.Obama's budget and the coming debate in Congress will focus on how to work within those limits.\"We're on track to having discretionary spending the lowest as a share of the economy since we started recording discretionary spending in 1962,\" White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman said last week. \"With that comes a lot of choices that we'd rather not be making ... there are pretty difficult choices in just about every area of the budget.\"Even with only a minuscule spending increase, Obama's budget proposals are unlikely to become law anytime soon.The divided US Congress controls the government's purse strings and Republicans who hold power in the House disagree with policy priorities such as added spending on job training and other programs in Obama's budget.\nThat means Obama's blueprint is more of a campaign document than a road map to the country's fiscal path over the next year. It will be used to guide messaging in the November congressional elections in which Democrats are fighting to keep control of the US Senate and avoid losing seats in the House.The budget will flesh out a proposal Obama made in his State of the Union address to expand a tax break for the working poor known as the Earned Income Tax Credit. He wants to increase the size of the credit for workers without children.The credit, which has been in place since the mid-1970s, is meant to give low-income workers an incentive to work rather than receive government handouts. However, it is substantially more generous for workers with children. Those with at least one child can receive up to US$3,305 this year, while the maximum for childless workers is US$496.The benefit also begins to phase out at a much lower income level for childless workers  -  as soon as US$8,810, as opposed to at US$17,830 for a worker with one child.\"It will be a strong antipoverty measure,\" said Jared Bernstein, a former economic aide to US Vice President Joe Biden who is now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.A 2009 Georgetown University paper put the cost of such an expansion at US$12.1 billion.Another of Obama's priorities is an expansion of early childhood education.Advocates say that Obama's \"universal pre-kindergarten\" idea would better prepare children for school and help workers by making childcare more widely available."

But the proposal is at risk of being sideswiped by growing resistance from other provinces, he said.\n\nBNN Video\n\nQuebec, Alberta and Manitoba are staunchly opposed to Mr. Flaherty's plan to replace Canada's 13 provincial and territorial regulators with a single entity that would police the buying and selling of stocks and bonds. Now officials in British Columbia and New Brunswick are expressing serious concerns, and Saskatchewan, which has not formally declared a position on the subject, is being pitched by Alberta on the idea of forming a regulator for Western Canada.\n\n\"I think the federal government is losing control of this file,\" Mr. Duncan said Thursday. \"I'm getting very nervous about this. There's no federal leadership.\"\n\nMr. Duncan's rare outburst against his federal counterpart illustrates the political difficulties that accompany Mr. Flaherty's attempts to overhaul a system that has existed for decades and is frequently derided by investors and public companies as both inefficient and ineffective. What worries Mr. Duncan is that Ontario could end up as the lone provincial voice backing the plan.\n\nMr. Flaherty countered that successive federal governments have tried and failed to change the system over the past 40 years. \"We as the federal government have moved the issue farther down the field than ever before in the history of Canada,\" he told reporters on Thursday.\n\nThe fate of the country's antiquated regulatory system will ultimately be determined by the Supreme Court of Canada, where the federal government will attempt to secure a ruling that it has the authority to create a single agency. Mr. Flaherty said the matter is \"quite properly where it ought to be now.\"\n\nEvery province, with the exception of Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, has filed an application with the top court seeking to participate in the two-day hearing next April.\n\nAlberta and Quebec have always said they want no part of a national regulator. Manitoba formally renounced the initiative in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe federal government will face an uphill battle in court, given the number of provinces resisting the initiative, said Eugene Szach, a lawyer in the Manitoba government's Justice department.\n\n\"One of the issues to be resolved is how the feds decide that they've suddenly acquired jurisdiction to take over a field that's been regulated by the provinces for decades,\" he said in an interview.\n\nNew Brunswick has not officially tipped its hand. But an expert witness for the government concludes in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court that all three Maritime provinces have been shortchanged under Confederation.\n\n\"New Brunswickers and other Maritimers view 'National Policy' or 'National Policies' as code words for looking after the economic interests of Central Canada,\" Donald Savoie, a professor of public administration and governance at the University of Moncton and one of the region's most respected voices on public policy, says in the affidavit. \"I see no reason why this 'national' initiative would be much different from other 'national' initiatives.\"\n\nSaskatchewan has not taken a position on a national regulator. But Premier Brad Wall will be at the Grey Cup game in Edmonton on Sunday with Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach, where the two leaders plan to talk about securities regulation. \"We'd like Saskatchewan to join us in our opposition to the federal proposal,\" said a spokesman for Alberta's Finance Minister.\n\nBritish Columbia supports a national regulator, but it must be in the province's best interests, B.C. Finance Minister Colin Hansen said in an interview. \"We would not want to see it in any way undermine provincial jurisdiction,\" he said.\n\nThe head of the B.C. Securities Commission warned this week that a national regulator could put the growth of British Columbia businesses in \"serious jeopardy\" by choking off access to investment dollars.\n\nB.C. policy makers are at a crossroads. Premier Gordon Campbell backed the Flaherty plan despite significant opposition in his province. But now he is stepping down.\n\n\"With Campbell now on his way out, I think the people who have never been comfortable with this decision feel a new freedom to voice their views,\" said an Alberta government source.\n\nNext story\n\n| Learn More\n\nDiscover content from The Globe and Mail that you might otherwise not have come across.

        "webpage": "Why The Markets Shrugged Off French Vote By John Ydstie\nMay 8, 2012 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email A supporter of French President-elect Francois Hollande wears a mask of outgoing President Nicolas Sarkozy.\nThomas Coex\nOriginally published on May 8, 2012 7:41 am The arguments for growth policies as opposed to austerity are taking center stage in Europe after the French and Greek elections. His rhetoric aside, France's President-elect Francois Hollande is not rejecting austerity. In fact, he pledged to balance France's budget by the end of his five-year term, just one year later than his opponent, outgoing President Nicolas Sarkozy. That's one reason the bond market's reaction to Hollande's victory was a yawn. Jacob Kirkegaard, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the market correctly perceived that the president-elect is not going to embark on some huge stimulus program in France. Kirkegaard says that's likely to disappoint many of Hollande's supporters. \"He has led them to believe that he is going to usher in this new era of spending and the end of austerity through his rhetoric, but I think the reality is very, very different,\" Kirkegaard says. Nevertheless, Kirkegaard says, Hollande will push Europe to add a growth component to its strategy, \"which is something that in recent weeks Angela Merkel and other German leaders have been positive about.\" Strategies For Solvency The growth strategies being considered, however, don't involve boosting government spending at the member state level. Rather, they involve growth-friendly moves like reforming labor regulations, to make it easier for workers to cross borders and work anywhere in the EU. Other strategies include expanding the European Investment Bank, and funding infrastructure projects with bonds backed jointly by all EU countries, but most importantly Germany. \"What I agree with is that Europe cannot solve its problems through austerity alone,\" says Mohamed El-Erian, CEO of the giant bond fund PIMCO. He's concerned about too little growth in Europe, but also about too much debt. \"What bond investors are looking at in order to put in more capital is a set of policies that addresses too little growth and too much debt,\" he says. Bond investors apparently felt Hollande's victory was a move in that direction. Interest rates on France's 10-year bond fell to a seven-month low after the vote. Reaction In Greece There was greater market discomfort with the results of parliamentary elections in Greece. Moderates there lost ground to fringe parties on the right and left amid demands to renegotiate the Greek bailout package, with its tough austerity measures. The Greek stock market fell, and its banks were especially hard-hit. Jacob Kirkegaard says the results in Greece raise the odds that it may leave the eurozone, but he says the country's fortunes are unlikely to affect the world in the same way they did last summer. \"This is really a fight between the taxpayers of Greece and the taxpayers in the rest of the euro area,\" he says. \"This will be volatile, but I don't think it will have the huge contagious effect that we saw last year.\" Kirkegaard says that's because under the most recent bailout package, the big losses on Greek debt were already distributed, and Europe's banks are in better shape now than they were last year.Copyright 2012 National Public Radio.

        "webpage": "commentsAppetite for dim sum bonds growingBy Hibah Yousuf @CNNMoneyInvest\nFebruary 15, 2012: 1:52 PM ET Total dim sum bond issuance nearly tripled to $14 billion last year, as 84 companies and government institutions issued yuan-denominated bonds, according to Dealogic.NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Dim sum bonds may sound like something on a Chinese brunch menu, but they're actually one of the hottest investments to come out of the world's second-largest economy. In fact, total issuance for these bonds, issued in the Chinese yuan, reached nearly $14 billion last year, as 84 companies and government institutions jumped into the fray, according to Dealogic. Print\nThat's already more than the combined total issued since the bonds debuted in 2007. And so far this year, issuance has already topped $1 billion. The so-called dim sum bond market really began to take off in mid-2010, after the People's Bank of China loosened its grip on the yuan by unpegging it from the dollar and lifting trading restrictions that led to offshore yuan trading in Hong Kong. Though China still maintains control of its currency, experts say the policy shift was a necessary step to eventually allow the yuan to float freely and have financial markets set its value, potentially making China less reliant on the U.S. dollar. \"China's decision to allow its mainland currency to trade offshore was a real turning point for the dim sum bond market,\" said Edmund Harriss, manager of the Guinness Atkinson Renminbi Yuan and Bond Fund (GARBX). \"It led to a growth of yuan deposits in Hong Kong, and served as an impetus to find an instrument where that idle cash could be invested.\"Harriss launched his fund last June to capitalize on the growth. Similarly, Guggenheim Investments introduced the Guggenheim Yuan Bond ETF (RMB) in September, while Van Eck Global followed with the Market Vectors Renminbi Bond ETF (CHLC) in October and Invesco PowerShares launched thePowerShares Chinese Yuan Dim Sum Bond ETF (DSUM) in November.Emerging markets have their mojo backFor Chinese companies, the dim sum bond market allows them to borrow yuan at relatively lower yields in Hong Kong and remit them back home. And for multinationals like McDonald's (MCD, Fortune 500), Caterpillar (CAT, Fortune 500), Yum! Brands (YUM, Fortune 500), British consumer goods company Unilever (UN) and Mexico's America Movil (AMX), dim sum bonds help cut borrowing costs. Companies can directly borrow in yuan to fund their Chinese business operations, while also hedging against the yuan's rise against the dollar.There aren't exactly a slew of companies clamoring for dim sum bonds just yet, given the low borrowing rates in the United States. But those that have major business operations in China are more likely to give them a try, especially as the market matures and liquidity grows, said Harriss. That may be sooner rather than later, says Axel Merk, president of Merk Mutual Funds, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based money manager specializing in currency investments. \"A lot of Asia is financing debt in U.S. dollars, but not from U.S. banks,\" said Merk. \"European banks serve as the biggest funding source for emerging markets, and they're facing some challenges right now.\"Amid fears that lending in Europe is drying up, China's fixed income market could develop even more quickly, he added. 0:00 / 1:47 Our China trade war ... of wordsBut it has a long way to go. The dim sum bond market is only 0.08% the size of the U.S. bond market, making it more susceptible to market shocks. And while China is moving in the right direction with its policies, it still maintains rigid control and it will likely take years for its capital markets to be fully developed, said Harriss.\"Its entire banking system is funded by deposits,\" said Harriss. \"As long as the deposit space is secure, China's banking system is secure. That's why China is still wary about how money moves in and out of its borders.\" Because of China's control and limits on the flow of its currency between onshore and offshore markets, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) crafted measures to help protect banks and their clients making transactions in offshore yuan. The new guidelines include a mechanism that would allow banks to settle their transactions in U.S. dollars in the event that the offshore yuan market collapses.

In December, U.S. federal prosecutors brought criminal charges against Cho, who operated in Chicago, Seattle, Boston and Newton, Massachusetts.\n\"With any startup company, early-stage investors that are putting their capital and their belief and trust into the company are exposing themselves to a great deal of loss,\" said Walsh.\n\"The workers who often get stock options should the company ever go public, are putting in their sweat equity, so why would a stranger approach you, give you an opportunity to get in on this ground-floor investment -- you need to ask, 'why me?'\"\nShe said con artists commonly manage to persuade investors to take part in their scams by dangling \"phantom riches\" -- the promise of huge guaranteed returns for getting in on the ground floor.\nFINRA recommends a few things investors can do to avoid cons: verify that the person touting the investment is licensed; look the person up on the Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator (here); Google them; and get a second opinion from a licensed investment professional or an attorney."

        "webpage": "Catella's Mats Andersson sees a 'doped-up market\n\nBy: Mats Andersson | 07 Nov 2013\n\nWith the local stock market up some 23% so far in 2013, Mats Andersson, chief executive of Swedish manager Catella, has sounded a note of caution about the market's reliance on easy money from quantitative easing measures.\n\nI have previously written about the \"search for yield\" in an environment where \"cheap\" money is flowing into the global financial markets. Earlier this autumn we saw evidence that the market is dependent on cheap money when the US Fed began to whisper about \"tapering\" or, in other words, the start of a gradual reduction of its bond purchases. The reaction of the market was rising long-term interest rates and stock market jitters.\n\nThe purpose of the easy monetary policy from the world's central banks is to heal and create a recovery in the global economy after the financial crash of 2008/09. The economies are slowly healing, but underlying growth rates are not convincing yet. However, many asset prices have rebounded sharply in recent years.\n\nCould it be that all this cheap money is becoming addictive to the market? Or, in other words, is it that when the availability of this cheap money starts to decrease the stock market will fall and interest rates will rise sharply? Long-term doping can cause side effects. Is it the case that the market is doped-up by the extremely loose monetary policy, and what side effects could this have?\n\nSomewhat simplistically, we can use physics to illustrate the forces on the financial markets. If you build a tall tower on small or weak foundations you are taking a risk. If the foundation starts to shake the tower begins to sway and, in the worst case, it topples.\n\nFor several years, the world experienced a dramatic expansion of credit that ended in the Lehman crash. A tower of credit grew to enormous heights on small and weak foundations. When it began to shake, we initially saw the top swaying (volatility) before the tower finally toppled - and the crash came.\n\nOne relevant question is whether the financial towers around the world have started to grow too tall again. This is due to an easy supply of cheap money that more often goes to investments in areas such as financial markets and real estate, instead of to investment in growth that should form the foundation. We saw very recently in the news that gearing on the US stock market is at a record high. Is it the case that the real economy this is resting on is healthy and growing sufficiently? In other words, is the foundation solid enough to bear the \"financial towers\" going forward? It is important to emphasise that a lot has happened since the financial crisis of 2008. For example, capital requirements for banks have been raised, regulations on risk-taking have been strengthened, and there is substantially more oversight from regulators of the risks taken by financial institutions. I certainly do not believe that the towers will topple going forward, but they may begin to sway a little more.\n\nVolatility is now extremely low by historical standards (see chart). We still have extremely low bond yields and the values of many assets require very favourable future prospects, and with this in mind it would not be surprising if volatility increased.\n\nAs mentioned, we did see signs of this earlier this autumn, but when the Fed announced that the easy monetary policy would continue for a while the market stabilised again.\n\nI have asked a number of open questions and there are no simple or obvious answers. However, it is important to be aware of the risks and challenges of the market. This is clearly reflected in Catella's management organisation. It is not at all the case that we sit around worrying about taking risk, but on the other hand we have very good risk analysis and risk control. This is essential to enable the long-term delivery of a high risk-adjusted yield for our unit holders."

The policy is\nbasically of two types:\n\nCollectors of fine arts\n\nGallery owners of fine arts\n\nThe difference in the coverage is on factors like itemized\nlisting, value of the coverage, transit limits etc. Often individual owners of collections are\nnot aware of the value of their collection to get the appropriate coverage for\nit. In such a situation it would be wiser to get the items appraised by a\nprofessional appraiser. Many insurance companies offer the facility of an\nappraiser to assess the value of the works of art every few years. This ensures that adequate insurance coverage\nis provided to the collection and will also provide the insured with\ndocumentary evidence for any future claims.\n\nFine arts insurance is offered by\nmany insurance companies but it is important to know the general coverage and\nexclusions in such policies before opting for one.

        "webpage": "No deal reached at EU summit\nBy The Associated PressBRUSSELS - A summit of the European Union's 27 national leaders, charged with agreeing on a long-term budget for the bloc, broke up Friday afternoon without being able to reach a deal.\nComing just days after the 17 eurogroup finance ministers failed, yet again, to agree on the conditions for releasing badly needed bailout money for Greece, the failure of the two-day summit raises questions about how the bloc makes important decisions. In most cases, unanimity is required, meaning that each country wields veto power.The EU's top officials, who put in long hours trying to soften up the national leaders individually before putting them together in the same meeting room, tried to put a brave face on the budget deadlock.European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who presides over the summits, said the \"constructive discussions\" at the summit meant an agreement could be reached early next year. He added that the national leaders had instructed him and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to continue working toward consensus over the coming weeks.Barroso, too, called the talks constructive. But he added, \"we are not yet at the point of reaching consensus.\"The prospect of failure had hung over the EU leaders' summit, charged with agreeing on a long-term spending plan of about $1.25 trillion for the 27-country bloc, even before the meeting began. Some countries wanted the budget to rise, while others insisted it had to fall.Van Rompuy tried to thread the needle.He proposed a budget with some cuts, but in a post-summit press conference, he also offered a nod to those countries who believe greater spending is essential to spur growth in countries hit by recession.\"Growth in one country benefits all,\" he said.British Prime Minister David Cameron, the most vocal proponent of holding the line on EU spending, said he had found \"strong allies\" in the Dutch and Swedish leaders. And, indeed, it appeared that some countries, including Germany, took pains to ensure that Britain - a country some fear may eventually withdraw from the EU - did not find itself isolated.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte stressed that it was important that Britain \"remain engaged\" with Europe \"because Britain is important to the EU as a whole.\"For his part, Cameron was firm.\"The deal on the table from the EU President was just not good enough,\" Cameron told reporters after the summit broke up.\n\"\"We haven't got the deal we wanted but we've stopped what would have been an unacceptable deal,\" he said. \"And in European terms I think that goes down as progress.\"The EU budget funds primarily programs to help farming and spur growth in the bloc's less developed countries. In financial terms, the budget amounts to only about 1 percent of the EU's gross domestic product, but carries great political significance as it lays bare the balance of power between the bloc's members.The bloc found itself divided, notably between richer countries that wanted to contain their contributions to the common budget at a time of economic malaise, and poorer ones that rely on EU money for development aid and economic investment.While Cameron and some other leaders demanded restraint, French President Francois Hollande wanted the budget to keep paying subsidies for farming and development programs. A number of poorer nations, which are net recipients of EU budget money, argued that a robust budget was good for all countries.A revised proposal given to the leaders late Thursday by Van Rompuy did little to appease either side. It kept the same total of \u20ac972 billion ($1.25 trillion) in states' commitments as his first proposal  -  \u20ac21 billion less than the 2007-2013 budget  -  but it shifted some money away from investment projects toward aid for farming and development.Hollande said Van Rompuy's proposal was reasonable. \"We want a consistent budget that funds EU policies,\" Hollande said.Further cuts, the French president said, would not be welcome.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the strong differences of opinion were no cause for alarm  -  and she wasn't taking sides in the argument between those who want more spending and those who want less.\"We should be able to bridge those differences,\" she said. \"We have a reached a good basis to continue our work.\"\"Our bilateral talks showed there is sufficient ground to reach agreement,\" she said.There is no set deadline for a deal, but the closer it gets to 2014, the tougher it will be for a smooth introduction of new programs. If there is no deal up to 2014, there would be a rollover of the 2013 budget plus a 2 percent increase accounting for inflation."

        "webpage": "Altus is back on air, details here. Three Years After The Market Crash, A 'New Normal' By Marilyn Geewax\nSep 25, 2011 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Three years ago this month, chaos ruled in financial markets. Huge financial companies, such as Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and AIG were stumbling, and government officials were scrambling to prevent a global financial meltdown. They threw together bailouts and pushed weak companies to merge with stronger ones. The central bankers, Treasury officials and lawmakers eventually did manage to reassure investors enough to restore order in the financial system. However, the aftershocks of the crisis are still being felt today. Some 14 million people continue to look for work in this country, and millions more struggle to hang on to their homes and retirement savings. For them, the tough times continue. Still, as bad as it may have felt, the period covering the past two years could not be labeled a recession. Economists define a true recession as a sustained period  -  usually six months or more  -  when economic activity is declining across the board. During such times, retail sales are falling, jobs are disappearing, houses aren't selling and factory production is dropping. That's the sort of broad-based decline that started spreading in 2007 as the housing foreclosure crisis began taking hold. The National Bureau of Economic Research, which is recognized as having the authority to call a recession, says that by December 2007, the entire U.S. economy was shrinking. It continued shrinking for the next 18 months  -  the longest recession since the 1930s. That official recession ended in June 2009, when growth resumed in most sectors. In the first half of 2010, the growth rate was approaching a healthy 4 percent, but then the economic rebound faded. This year, growth has been crawling along at around 1 percent or less. The economy is being held back by a number of forces, including many coming from overseas. For example, global growth has been slowed by this spring's earthquake in Japan and the political upheavals in oil-producing countries in the Middle East. The debt crisis in Europe is an especially heavy drag on the U.S. economy because it is creating uncertainty about the global banking system. As a result, the stretch from 2007 to today has felt like one nonstop recession for the millions of people who have lost jobs, homes and retirement savings. Last week, the Federal Reserve Board assessed this recovery and concluded that there are still \"significant downside risks.\" Economists have been tossing out different labels to describe this strange period when recession and recovery seem indistinguishable to so many people. Here are a few: \"The Great Recession\"  -  This term started turning up frequently in 2008 as a play on the phrase \"Great Depression,\" a term associated with the 1930s, when banks failed and the economy crashed. \"The Lost Decade\"  -  This phrase was used often to describe Japan during the period from 1991 to 2001, when growth in that country fell dramatically after an asset-bubble burst. Now, some economists say that describes the U.S. situation today: Investors are facing a Lost Decade characterized by historically low interest payments and a troubled stock market. \"The New Normal\"  -  This a phrase that has gained a lot of traction recently. It refers to the idea that the U.S. economy will be characterized by growth of just 1 or 2 percent for a long stretch of years. That's well below the healthy growth rate of 3 or 4 percent that was the normal in the second half of the 20th century.Copyright 2011 National Public Radio. To see more, visit . Our Partners"

        "webpage": "Food Stamps Helped Many Families Weather The Recession\nShare Tweet E-mail Comments Print By editor Originally published on Tue April 17, 2012 9:26 am\nFood stamps kept the carts rolling during the recession.\nFood stamps have long been a favorite whipping boy of politicians looking to beat up on government spending. But the massive food-assistance program does help keep people out of poverty, according to new research. Food stamp benefits led to a decline of 4.4 percent in poverty from 2000 to 2009, according to a new report from the USDA's Economic Research Service. The impact was particularly strong for children, who are more likely to live in poverty than adults. Child poverty was reduced by 15.5 percent, on average. The researchers also looked at the depth and severity of poverty, and found that severity was reduced by 21 percent. They say looking at this gives a better measure of the role of food stamps in improving the lives of Americans, compared to just a straight look at the poverty rate. In 2009, 21 percent of all children, or 15.5 million, lived in poverty. That's up from 16 percent in 2001, an increase attributed to the economic downturn. And that's including the buffering effect of food stamps. A family of four would have to earn less than $23,050 to be considered poor in 2012, according to the the Department of Health and Human Services. There's no question that a lot of people are affected by the food stamp program, which is formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Last year, 44.7 million Americans got food stamp benefits in an average month. That added up to $72 billion in benefits for the year. Food stamps figured in the presidential primaries: Republican candidate Newt Gingrich suggested the program was letting millionaires eat steak on the government's dime. Use of food stamps is indeed up in high-income zip codes, as we reported last December. But economists say that's more a factor of long-term unemployment rather than gaming the system to feast courtesy of the government. The budget plan passed by the House earlier this month would slash spending for food stamps, as well as for other federal entitlement programs.Copyright 2014 NPR. To see more, visit .

        "webpage": "Opportunities for Blockchain Development\n\nHave you ever purchased a ticket to a concert or sporting event from another party and walked to the gate with trepidation, hoping you didn't purchase a counterfeit ticket? Those days may be coming to an end, thanks to the adoption of blockchain technology and interesting opportunities for future blockchain development.\n\nFor those new to blockchain, we have provided some basics below. For those more versed on the subject, please click here.\n\nBlockchain technology first came about as a way to enable bitcoin transactions, however, bitcoin and blockchain are not the same thing. Blockchain is a system that allows a group of connected computers to main a single updated and secure ledger.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach computer on the blockchain network records the transaction, meaning it's a decentralized way of storing information. Once the transaction is completed, it's secured sequentially using timestamps and cryptography, and then is later stamped again on a block of transactions. The block is then woven into other transaction blocks, and ultimately an irreversible public record.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nBefore blockchain, a centralized authority, such as a bank or government would record the transaction. In a centralized authority model, security can be compromised. The rise of hackers and countless corporate security breaches such as Equifax, Target, and Uber, have only made this more prevalent. Blockchain uses hashes and cryptography, which basically means complex math problems from the network of computers, which are too complicated for a standard computer to solve. In fact, it may take a standard computer over a year of guessing random numbers, which is a year too late. This enables irreversible transactions and security.\n\nHow does this keep my concert ticket secure?\n\nThe original ticket is recorded and blockchain provides an escrow for both parties. The buyer gets reassurance that the ticket is valid and original (not a pdf printed off and sold a dozen times) and the seller is assured payment. Once the transaction is completed and timestamped it's then stored onto blocks which are woven into the digital ledger and public record. The transaction is impossible to reverse or fake, giving the concert ticket goer a sense of security.\n\nWhat's next for blockchain?\n\nBesides concert tickets, the opportunities for blockchain are numerous and are keeping developers working on blockchain busy. One such practice is using blockchain for financial trading. Stock exchanges have complicated procedures and systems, which are ripe for disruption. A typical trade involves pre-trade, trade, post-trade, custody, and security servicing, all are prone to hacks or errors. Blockchain can make this streamlined and more secure. The opportunity for blockchain development is improving the speed, as the current distributed ledgers have capacity issues.\n\nSupply chain is another big opportunity for blockchain development. The transaction of goods from one country to another is also a complex maze. Shipping is much less tech savvy than finance, so supply chain has an opportunity to leapfrog several process upgrades. For example, a typical good manufactured and shipped from Shenzen to Los Angeles goes through a multitude of intermediaries. This generally requires a mountain of paperwork as the product goes through the chain of custody. Similar to finance, this has opportunities for lost paperwork, slow movement, and human error. Hijro is a leading example of how companies are utilizing this opportunity with a blockchain platform allowing assets to simultaneously interoperate on multiple networks. True North, a software engineering company, helped to build Hijro's F.I.X platform connecting 2 or more blockchain networks, allowing for secure transactions in industries such as supply chain and finance. Blockchain could significantly reduce the transaction costs and shipping time, while providing increased security.\n\nWe will continue to share our thoughts on the next opportunities for blockchain and welcome our readers thoughts on how it may help solve their industries challenges.\n\nAuthors\n\nBrian Samson is a CoFounder of True North, where he leads strategy, operations, and delivery. Prior, he was on the leadership team for 3X startup exits. He holds an MBA from UCLA Anderson School of Management."

Examining the Potential for Cross-South Pacific Trade: ASEAN and Latin America1 Dec 2010Working paper series This paper discusses the potential for cross-South Pacific trade between selected Southeast Asian and Latin American economies. The objective of this discussion is to identify obstacles for more intensive trade between the observed countries. Firstly, the paper reviews trends in trade flows and trade patterns between the selected economies, and by using several trade performance indicators it finds the level of trade still relatively low. It then discusses the possible reasons for this state of affairs. Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2010: Year-end Update \"Maintaining Growth Amid Global Uncertainty\"1 Dec 2010Flagship publications and book series 2010 has seen an impressive recovery of the Asia-Pacific region from the Great Recession of 2008/09. Led by the large economies of China and India, output growth in the region rebounded in 2009 and gathered further strength in 2010. But the region is faced with a weakening of growth in the developed economies which are grappling with a combination of weak household demand and fiscal retrenchment. MPDD Working Paper on Economic cooperation and connectivity in the Asia-Pacific region30 Nov 2010Working paper series The region needs to invest in an efficient system of regional infrastructure for a seamless Asia to emerge. This will provide the foundation for Asian common markets and facilitate the creation of an eventual pan-Asian community. None of this will be easy, but it will have to be done by building institutions, harmonizing policies and regulations, developing and aligning standards, and, most crucially, attracting the required capital to the right kinds of regional projects.

The government has been pushing the Make in India initiative along with urging people to 'Keep in India' i.e. keep Indian money within the country by using domestic products and services.\n\nThe letter by Mastercard emphasised that while Modi's digital payments push was \"commendable\", the Indian government had adopted \"a series of protectionist measures\" to the detriment of global companies.\n\n\"Increasing rhetoric from the prime minister and government mandates on promotion and preference for RuPay ... continues to create market access issues for US payments technology companies,\" the note said.\n\n\"The Indian government's preferential treatment of RuPay coupled with fallacies on pricing must be discontinued,\" the company said, asking the US government to intervene in the matter.\n\nIn response to Reuters' queries, Mastercard said in a statement that it \"fully supports\" the Indian government's initiatives and is \"deeply invested\" in the country.\n\nEarlier this year, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in its proposed draft ecommerce policy also suggested that RuPay card should be made mandatory for all payment gateways in India. If implemented, this move can further make it harder for international card companies like Mastercard and Visa to penetrate deeper in India.\n\n'RuPay' Is Not The Only Fight!\n\nThe global payment companies such as Mastercard, Visa, Paypal among others are already battling with the data localisation issue in the Indian territory. The US companies reportedly demanded 12 months extension to comply with the RBI directive on data localisation.\n\nOn April 6, the RBI had issued a directive under Section 10(2) along with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007, (Act 51 of 2007) stating that all system providers shall ensure that the entire data relating to payment systems operated by them are stored in a system only in India by October 15.\n\nOn October 12, two US senators had called on the PM Narendra Modi to soften India's stance on data localisation, warning that measures requiring it represent \"key trade barriers\" between the two nations, reports Reuters.\n\nHowever, RBI took its stand here and denied to give any additional extension to the deadline here.\n\nIndian Debit/ Credit Card Domain: A Burgeoning Opportunity\n\nA December 2017 report titled 'Flavors of Fast, 2017' by US-based Fidelity National Information Services said, \"The introduction of UPI in August 2016 led to the creation of a wealth of new innovative payment solutions, and the adoption rates of UPI payments are truly spectacular. UPI opens up access to real-time by allowing payments to be directly integrated into external business applications.\"\n\nNumbers continue to prove the statement true. Recently, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) announced 19% growth in the number of UPI transactions for October 2018.\n\nAt the same time, the data revealed by the Reserve Bank of India in February 2018 showed that payments via debit and credit cards at the point of sale declined to 247.1 Mn in February from 271.1 Mn in January. The value of transactions in February fell to $7.18 Bn (INR 465.9 Bn) from $8.04 Bn (INR 521.9 Bn) in January.\n\nAccording to the recent data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), cards still have remained the dominant form of payment at $52.57 Mn (INR 355 Cr) for April against $19.69 Mn(INR 133 Cr) for prepaid payment instruments."

Rowe profiles macroeconomist Jacques Polak\nA Legacy of Model Elegance\nJacques Polak  - a major 20th-century economist whose pioneering research molded the basic economic approach of the IMF - nearly spent his life as an accountant. When he enrolled at the University of Amsterdam in 1932, the 18-year-old planned to join the family accounting firm. But a newly rigorous program in the Netherlands required aspiring CPAs to first get a degree in economics before doing postgraduate work in accountancy. As a result, Polak said in an oral history he gave to the IMF in 2005, his goals \"changed with the surroundings.\" Like many students in the Depression era, Polak became absorbed by high unemployment and economic malaise. After a year doing parallel work in graduate economics and accountancy, he lost interest in becoming a CPA.\nInstead, he embarked on a 70-year career as an economist and international civil servant - a career that continues nearly 30 years after his formal retirement. He joined the League of Nations in its dying days and, almost a decade later, hired on to the newly created IMF, where he helped put in place a cooperative international economic model - hatched at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, which he attended.\nAs a senior IMF official for three decades, he played a major role in the development of the international monetary system, including the creation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - the international reserve asset. But Polak and colleagues agree that his most enduring contribution to both economics and the Fund is the economic model that bears his name. The Polak Model explained a country's balance of payments in monetary terms, enabling economists to understand the causes of a country's international economic imbalances. And, by pinpointing the source of balance of payments problems in domestic credit creation, the model also gave the IMF the ability to prescribe steps a country should take to correct them.\nThe IMF that Polak joined in 1947 (and where he maintains an office at the age of 94) oversaw an international monetary system based on fixed exchange rates, with gold and the U.S. dollar at the center. Private capital played a small role, and by the 1960s a major worry was international liquidity - whether there would be enough dollars around to facilitate the volume of transactions among countries essential to global growth and prosperity. That system transformed into one in which exchange rates are free to fluctuate in response to market forces and gold's role has essentially ended. Today, private capital flows dominate the international financial system.\nAs a top IMF staff official from 1958 through 1979, Polak was part of sometimes thorny economic and political decisions that marked the system's metamorphosis: negotiations over IMF loans to the United Kingdom in 1965 and 1967, creation of the SDR, and the death of the global fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s. Later, he was Executive Director from 1981 to 1986 for the Netherlands, whose constituency included two socialist economies seeking IMF assistance.\nPerhaps as befits an economist who found his calling in the Great Depression, Polak's first major work, his 1937 doctoral thesis, studied the use of public works to counteract an economic downturn. In writing it, he sought the guidance of Jan Tinbergen, who in 1969 would share the first Nobel laureate in economics. Tinbergen had already developed an econometric model of the Dutch economy and would soon develop one for the United States. By 1937, Tinbergen had moved from Amsterdam to Geneva to do econometric studies of business cycles for the League of Nations. He asked Polak to join him as an assistant.\nIt was an exciting time for Polak, whose work table was at right angles to Tinbergen's desk. \"I had the opportunity to absorb his method of work as if by osmosis,\" Polak wrote in the introduction to a collection of his papers. \"I learned more mathematics and even, I believe"

During the global financial crisis, the G-20 became the primary forum to agree on basic principles in areas such as the fiscal-policy response and the role of the International Monetary Fund. By underscoring the need to avoid trade protectionism and other beggar-thy-neighbor policies, it also put some pressure on governments concerning what not to do. In these respects, the G-20 was clearly a step forward.Lately, however, as the G-20 has tried to reconcile divergent national economic interests and recovery strategies, it has been far less successful relative to its initial meetings in Washington and London in 2009. Indeed, the G-20's Seoul summit in early November exposed a deep divide.\nGlobal imbalances and currency misalignments could well wreck the global recovery and push the world into the protectionist mire. Most nations would suffer, but nations caught in the middle would suffer the most. Today, the emerging economies of Latin America could become some of the first casualties in the economic crossfire between the United States and China.Consider Colombia, Chile, and Peru. These economies face two serious problems. The first is the flood of short-term capital heading their way. If there was ever any doubt, events of the last few years should have reinforced the lesson that too much capital chasing short-term yield can distort exchange rates and asset prices, potentially leading to financial catastrophe.Recipient countries can attempt to throw up barriers, but the tsunami of liquidity threatens to sweep over them. The dollar depreciation engineered by the US Federal Reserve seems an appealing proposition from the American standpoint, but the economies of Latin America cannot and should not bear the burden of dollar realignment.Then there is China. The Chinese authorities' reluctance to allow the renminbi to appreciate slows down global rebalancing and impedes world growth. Exports from Latin America are among the victims. Renminbi undervaluation has also caused Latin America to reduce its share of global manufacturing exports and become even more specialized in raw materials.As a result of the premature decline of the manufacturing sector, unemployment is high in many Latin American countries. To be sure, the re-commoditization of Latin America has causes that go beyond China's exchange-rate policies. But it is becoming increasingly difficult for factories in the region to remain in business under conditions of weak global demand and strong local currencies.These issues should be put on the table by the G-20's Latin American members - Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. But countries like Argentina and Brazil fear Chinese retaliation aimed at their commodity exports. For example, Argentina is worried about keeping the Chinese market open for soybean oil, after it was closed earlier this year. And Brazil has already said that it has no issues to raise with China, which recently became its largest export market.At the other extreme is Mexico, where competition with China is fierce. Out of both conviction and convenience, Mexico invariably sides with Washington and points to China's undervalued exchange rate as the cause of its economic stagnation.Colombia, Chile, and Peru have nearly 100 million people combined and a total GDP of more than $600 billion. Their sound financial systems, strong fiscal frameworks, low public debt, and strict adherence to inflation targets give them credibility. To reduce their dependence on commodities they also have signed free-trade agreements with the US (inexplicably not approved by the US Congress in the case of Colombia).These three countries are thus in a unique position to demand that the G-20 stop the US and China from pursuing beggar-thy-neighbor policies that represent a major threat to global economic stability. The problem is that Colombia, Chile, and Peru are not members of the G-20.If the G-20 wants to play a major role in the post-crisis global decision-making process, the issue of legitimacy vis-\u00e0-vis the smaller emerging countries needs to be addressed now. If countries are not adequately represented, international economic coordination will return by default to the multilateral institutions where it made little progress in the years that led up to the crisis. We propose changing the status quo by allowing these countries to take a rotating seat at the G-20 table. They can help steer the world toward coordinated recovery and save many emerging economies from becoming innocent casualties in other people's wars.\nNo, You Can't\nThinking the Unthinkable in Europe"

        "webpage": "According to Jane S. Shaw in her entry on Public Choice Theory in the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics at Econlib \"Public choice theory is a branch of economics that developed from the study of taxation and public spending. It emerged in the fifties and received widespread public attention in 1986, when James Buchanan, one of its two leading architects (the other was his colleague Gordon Tullock), was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics. Buchanan started the Center for Study of Public Choice at George Mason University, and it remains the best-known locus of public choice research. Others include Florida State University, Washington University (St. Louis), Montana State University, the California Institute of Technology, and the University of Rochester.\nPublic choice takes the same principles that economists use to analyze people's actions in the marketplace and applies them to people's actions in collective decision making. Economists who study behavior in the private marketplace assume that people are motivated mainly by self-interest. Although most people base some of their actions on their concern for others, the dominant motive in people's actions in the marketplace - whether they are employers, employees, or consumers - is a concern for themselves. Public choice economists make the same assumption - that although people acting in the political marketplace have some concern for others, their main motive, whether they are voters, politicians, lobbyists, or bureaucrats, is self-interest. In Buchanan's words the theory \"replaces... romantic and illusory... notions about the workings of governments [with]... notions that embody more skepticism.\"\"\nIn allocating individuals to this school of thought we have taken a broad perspective and have included some 18th and 19th century theorists who contributed to the formation of this school's special insights into the connection between political behavior and economics.\nLord Peter Thomas Bauer\nGary S.

We continue to witness a basic lack of ethical standards, the end result of which translates into higher consumer costs, economic ruin, cynicism, and most assuredly a lack of confidence in our business sector, government and society generally. And despite all of this, nothing is being done to train citizens and future business leaders concerning the simple task of proper behavior. This is playground stuff: Learn to play by the rules and, where rules don't exist, act appropriately. Why is it so hard for those of us in business suits to remember what our schoolmates and playground monitors taught us?\nIn 2002, the New Hampshire Securities Bureau reached a $5 million agreement with Tyco Corp. concerning its alleged corporate malfeasance. At that time, the settlement was one of the largest securities settlements in the nation's history. The funds have since been dedicated to establishing programs within higher education in the state for the advancement of ethical standards in both the private and public sectors.\nJust days ago it was announced JP Morgan will be ponying up $13 billion to state and federal regulators to address its mortgage dealings failures. It has been estimated the remaining level of legal exposure by the largest U.S. financial institutions could result in the settlement total for alleged mortgage fraud in the United States to be in excess of $100 billion. It is now evident 2013 will likely be the high-water mark toward addressing the responsibility of the financial-crisis era of the first decade of this century, a period resulting in two major economic slowdowns, all because of ethical lapses in our financial markets. Both periods resulted in congressional action to address regulatory shortcomings (Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002 and Dodd-Frank in 2010).\nUnfortunately, no action has been taken to address the ethical behavior breakdown in our country and how such behavior not only diminishes society but damages our economy as well our very way of life. No national effort has been crafted to teach that greed is not good. Now is the time to take stock of why ethics matters. We need to get America's future business and community leaders thinking about ethical behavior and what it means in terms of responsibility and accountability. American entrepreneurialism and government support for it has created the most dynamic country in world history. This dynamism has also produced unparalleled growth and economic opportunity.\nHowever, the recent past also shows that unlawful and unethical behavior left unchecked can result in moral breakdown and economic self-destruction. We must instill a sense of citizenship and personal responsibility across society.\nFinancial fraud settlement funds are not government budgeted money per se or even taxpayer dollars but instead are used to fund further government fraud mitigation programs as well as benefit the general treasury of government. However, none of the national financial fraud funds has been targeted to address the importance of personal responsibility and ethical conduct.\nWe propose the Congress direct a small portion of settlement funds to a dedicated national educational ethics program. We come to this notion as a former securities regulator and private equity manager of troubled and fraudulent funds. Such a program can be guided and administered by the recently established Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so as to promote ethics and ethical curricula within post-secondary education institutions, including professional graduate schools, as well as teaching the importance of ethical obligations in primary and secondary education.\nOur proposal offers the following guidelines for consideration: 1. a nonpartisan panel of educational, financial, consumer and business experts be established to propose how best to implement such a program; 2. any program is to be free of all ideological or political bias;\n3. the panel's work to be funded by an appropriation from financial fraud settlement funds; and 4. the award of any funds for the teaching of ethics in curricula is to be on a voluntary basis.\nFunds could also be used in concert to leverage the few already established ethics education programs in the nation. The basic premise of our proposal is a correlation between the fact that fraudulent behavior causes the literal diminution of the world economy and a modest part of the financial fraud settlement funds be utilized to address the root cause of the matter.\nDoing nothing will mean no real change. Consider that the settlement funds derived during 2002-03 for financial fraud did nothing to affect the course or impact of the much more severe 2007-10 financial crisis. It is time to act now and teach future generations that ethics matter, if only to diminish future economic blowups.\nBusiness can be rough at times, but it will be a better playground if we stop the endless games. Extending the lessons on how to play fair will be a boon to us all.\n(Mark Connolly is the former New Hampshire director of securities regulation and principal of New Castle Investment Advisors.

From driving customer loyalty to tailored training programs - evidence of the trend is springing up in boardrooms across the globe, but is it a gimmick or could it be really be the next big thinGamification is about taking the essential ingredients of a game and applying them to real-world, non-game situations. By introducing game mechanics such as rules, challenges and rewards for achievements; businesses can not only increase the fun factor, but most importantly motivate and engage their audience.\nEarly endeavors have proven that a healthy dose of competition really can make all the difference. Training, for example, is key to any business, yet traditional teaching methods are often more likely to induce slumber than an expansion of expertise. Here, gamification can provide a very real solution; but it's not as simple as providing points or badges for a job well done - effective gamification is something of an art form. The psychology of play\nIn any context, a game is only as good as it's design. When training, a clear understanding of how game elements can drive learning behavior must be gained before a gamified framework can be constructed. One of the most powerful aspects of games is their ability to ignite a player's emotions, producing everything from frustration to pride and therefore deeply engaging them in the task at hand. Beyond raw emotion - rules, for example, provide the player with boundaries within which they are free to explore and discover - testing theories and learning through trial and error. Problem solving can also be approached from a fresh perspective as players are provided with the opportunity to assume new identities and tackle challenges from within that new role.\nOnce considered, a game designer has to work out how to harness these drivers by carefully selecting the basic building blocks of a gamified system and placing them within the framework. These mechanics can include anything from points and leaderboards to levels, achievements and virtual goods. Each of these blocks have to satisfy basic human motivations, such as that for status, recognition and self-expression that are important to the player. The secret of successful gamified training is to accurately pinpoint the motivations of the learner and provide them with the perfect balance between challenge and reward. These small rewards represent only part of the overall gain, as they come accompanied by a reinforcement of learning objectives, constructive feedback and dynamic classroom environment.\nPlaying games in the workplace\nTypically, having fun doesn't trump deadlines on the to-do list of business executives - but gamification can be a potent way to dispel the tedium of training and boost the talent pool - without trivializing the learning content.\nDeloitte, for example, created a Leadership Academy - an innovative digital training program that is currently accessed by more than 50,000 users in over 14 different countries around the world. The academy provides content from leading educational and training institutions using an online portal and mobile applications. By signing up to the academy, senior executives can deepen their knowledge of effective self-development, communication methods, talent management, developing strategy and innovation. Most recently, collaborating with software company Badgeville, users who complete course modules, share ideas or reach notable leaderboard statuses are rewarded with badges - and can share their achievements through social networks, such as Linkedin and Twitter. Getting serious about gaming\nGamified mechanics, such as these are only the tip of the iceberg. Serious games can also involve the use of simulations that immerse the learner in a virtual world, allowing them to put theoretical knowledge to the test within a safe environment. The learning value of games such as these is marked. Research carried out by the Federation of American Scientists revealed that, \"Students remember only 10 percent of what they read; 20 percent of what they hear; 30 percent if they see visuals related to what they hear; 50 percent if they watch someone do something while explaining it; but almost 90 percent if they do the job themselves, even if only as a simulation\".\nWith such effective learning outcomes - it's easy to understand why the aviation industry, the military and medical teams have for decades relied on the strength simulations when training their experts; and finally companies have caught up.\nWith the seeds of potential having been sown, it is increasingly clear that with careful development and commitment, gamification could reinvent the way we train and learn - helping industries meet the complex challenges presented by the modern world and taking them to the next level.\nMichelle Katics is the CEO of BankersLab"

Cross-Border Swaps Deal to End U.S.-EU Regulation Overlap Accord breaks deadlock over whether the CFTC can impose its rules on trades booked in Europe.\nBy Silla Brush, Bloomberg July 12, 2013\nU.S. and European Union (EU) financial regulators took a step toward bringing derivatives trading under an integrated framework of global regulation designed to reduce risks in the $633 trillion swaps market.\nThe accord, announced jointly yesterday in Washington and Brussels by the EU and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), broke a deadlock over whether the U.S. could impose its rules on trades booked in Europe. Banks and other swaps traders said the deal reduces the chance they will be forced to comply with conflicting regulatory regimes.\n\"This shows that the CFTC recognizes that other countries and other jurisdictions have equally made a lot of progress and that they have to recognize those rules,\" Ken Bentsen, president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said in a telephone interview. \"The devil's in the details. But it would appear to be a shift in a positive way.\"\nThe securities association represents Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Citigroup Inc., among hundreds of banks and asset managers that had raised concerns about the international reach of CFTC swap-trading requirements. European and Asian regulators had complained that the U.S. agency was overreaching by trying to extend its rules to trades that are booked overseas.\nThe CFTC is set to officially complete its guidance on the reach of its rules today after CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and Mark Wetjen, a Democratic commissioner, resolved differences that had divided the commission's three Democrats, according to four people with knowledge of their talks. The two reached agreement on the principles and were drafting a document with the details, the people said.\nThe CFTC yesterday issued four decisions easing some rules and deadlines in accord with the joint agreement.\nLowering Risk\n\"We've taken another significant step in our mutual journey to bring transparency and lower risk to the swaps market worldwide,\" Gensler said in a statement with Michel Barnier, the EU's financial services chief.\nFailure to reach a deal could have led to \"conflicts of law, inconsistencies, and legal uncertainty,\" the CFTC and European Commission said in the joint statement. The agencies are \"leading by example and invite other countries to join this approach.\"\nUnder the deal, the CFTC agreed to accept some EU rulemaking as \"essentially identical\" to U.S. standards, allowing companies to apply only the rules of the jurisdiction where they are based. The concessions include rules on risk mitigation and how traders should settle disputes over the valuation of derivatives contracts.\nRule 'Equivalence'\nThe EU has long sought a system of so-called \"equivalence,\" where it accepts that U.S. rules are equally rigorous as its own and allows U.S. banks to comply only with their domestic requirements. The CFTC had resisted such a reciprocal approach toward Europe.\n\"Many had doubts about achieving greater global financial regulatory harmonization, but this demonstrates heavy-duty headway is being made,\" Bart Chilton, the third Democrat on the CFTC, said in a statement.\nThe CFTC also agreed to extend until the end of this year a deadline for EU-based clearinghouses to register with U.S. regulators, ensuring continued U.S. market access for EU-based clearinghouses including Deutsche Boerse AG's Eurex Clearing and LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd., the world's largest interest-rate clearinghouse. The original deadline was today.\nAIG Lessons\nGlobal regulators sought to bolster oversight of the swaps market after largely unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis and led to the rescue of American International Group Inc.

        "webpage": "Whatever Happened To The Economy? By editor\nMay 14, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email The economy is still a big issue, but Washington isn't doing much about it.\nPaul J. Richards\nOriginally published on May 14, 2013 12:36 pm Remember the economy? The election year was dominated by talk about jobs and the economy, but neither the administration nor Congress seems to have any grand ideas for jump-starting a still sluggish recovery  -  and they're not even talking about it much. President Obama sought to turn attention back to economic issues with a speech last week in Texas on manufacturing, but that's already long since been forgotten. A cascade of scandals has driven the issue entirely off the Washington radar. Even before Benghazi, the IRS and the Department of Justice controversies started heating up, the economy had consistently taken a back seat to issues such as immigration and gun control. \"The economy is by far the most important issue for voters,\" says Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute. \"It's not unusual for Washington preoccupations to be different than those of the public.\" She says that the public is skeptical that Washington can provide economic answers at this point. Politicians themselves seem a little dubious. The two parties remain far apart on economic issues. The type of debt reduction Republicans seek through overhauling entitlement programs is gaining little traction among Democrats, while the GOP-controlled House will never approve further stimulus of the type Democrats would like. \"We've moved away from proposals for big changes and toward piddle policy,\" says Stephen Weatherford, a political scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"My impression is both the president and the people around him have ratcheted back their expectations, so they've ratcheted back what they're willing to send to Congress.\" The Economic Picture If you looked only at Wall Street, it would seem that happy days might be nearly here again. The Dow Jones average passed a milestone last week, closing above 15,000 for the first time  -  nearly double its value at its trough early in the Obama presidency. Looking at Main Street, however, the picture looks entirely different. \"We're just sort of worn down by this subpar recovery that continues but doesn't ever seem to accelerate, and if so, not for very long,\" says Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness. Wall Street cheered last week's jobs report, which showed more people found work in April than expected. But it was still far from enough to take up much slack in the labor market. \"That level of growth will not get us up to pre-recession levels of unemployment until 2020,\" says Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. \"We are still in a massive crisis in the labor market.\" No Agreement In Washington Liberal economists like Shierholz argue that current conditions demand more stimulus  -  federal spending on things like infrastructure and aid to states and localities that would put people back to work. \"We have a situation where we have persistent high unemployment and interest rates near zero,\" Shierholz says. \"This is precisely the time when you want to do fiscal stimulus.\" Conservatives couldn't disagree more. Rather than increases in spending, Republicans are concerned with the nation's debt problem, which they see spiraling out of control. \"The administration is not willing to put forward a serious proposal to address the fiscal challenge, which would include meaningful reforms to Medicare and Social Security,\" says Phillip Swagel, who served as a Treasury Department official in the Bush administration. \"Instead, the administration has put forward modest proposals in both areas to intense opposition from progressive supporters.\" No Ideas To Sell For some, the deficit is starting to feel like a less pressing concern. In April, the Treasury Department ran a relatively rare monthly surplus, of $113 billion. Still, spending cuts demanded by the sequester are proof enough that Washington will not be getting back into the stimulus business, says Jason Seligman, an economist at Ohio State University. The nation can't spend more in the short term if it can't get its long-term budget in order, he says. But there's no agreement about how to get long-term spending under control. \"Really, we can't agree on anything,\" Seligman says. Indeed, there appears to be no appetite in Washington for further talk of a \"Grand Bargain,\" in which both parties would put cherished priorities on the table. Such cooperation would be politically risky at any point, but seems especially unlikely now, at what appears to be the beginning of a season of scandal and myriad congressional investigations. The end result is that any help the economy could use from Washington is going to remain long in coming. \"The issues circulating around the economy are so central to both parties' ideologies that their incentives for obstruction are even larger than they are for other issues,\" says Weatherford, the Santa Barbara professor.Copyright 2013 NPR.

CT Partners' global chief executive Brian Sullivan is visiting Australia, one of 17 countries where the firm operates.\nELEANOR HALL: The head of one of the world's top 10 executive search firms is urging Australian companies operating in Asia to confront what's known as the \"bamboo ceiling\" and increase the number of Asian executives on their boards.CTPartners global chief executive Brian Sullivan is in Australia this week.He says that the appointment of Asian directors is improving here but not enough.Reporter Brendan Trembath asked him to explain what he means by the bamboo ceiling.BRIAN SULLIVAN: Well, the bamboo ceiling is the reality that companies need to embrace local market customs and local market conditions if they're going to be investing outside of their home country and if they're going to be expecting that the growth of their overall business is going to come from cultures where they have a minimum level of expertise.BRENDAN TREMBATH: Australia is obviously keen to increase investment in Asia. Does the bamboo ceiling apply in that case?BRIAN SULLIVAN: Yes, the boards need to look at where their companies need to be 10 years out and then take a look at their boards and see if that reflects, if the cultural population of the board, reflects where the organisation needs to go and is making their investment.BRENDAN TREMBATH: Do you think there aren't enough people of Asian descent on Australian boards, at the big companies anyway?BRIAN SULLIVAN: Well, it's improved dramatically, I think, over the last couple of years or so it's increased from 4 per cent to 8 per cent, however the expectations as to investment dollars from Australia into the northern Asian regions and the percentage of revenue and profit that will be coming out northern Asia is certainly more than 8 per cent.So one would have to conclude that the representation of northern Asians on Australian boards isn't where it needs to be today but there are a couple of ways to attack that problem that we're currently working with a few companies on.BRENDAN TREMBATH: If you take a look at Australia's biggest listed companies, ANZ for example, the bank, there's Lee Hsien Yang on the board. You could call him Singaporean business royalty.Look at National Australia Bank, the rival bank, there's Anthony K.T. Yuen who has Bank of China experience. So how do you get more people like them onto Australian boards?BRIAN SULLIVAN: Well, that's going to be a challenge, Brendan, because quite candidly there aren't a whole heck of a lot of people that have the depth of experience and the tactical knowledge of those gentlemen and bravo to the Australian organisations that got them but when we're looking at accessing expertise, Asian expertise, there are a couple of way to do that.One is to consider advisory boards, which are less regulatory oriented and more business growth oriented, and actually can be looked upon as a more advantageous way for an Asian participant to assist in the growth of an Australian organisation.BRENDAN TREMBATH: We've talked about the bamboo ceiling. Of course, a better known ceiling has been preoccupying people here and elsewhere for a long time: the glass ceiling. What's the status of that in Australia, shattering that glass ceiling?BRIAN SULLIVAN: Well, there's progress being made. I believe that the statistics have also shown a doubling over the last few years or so. Our feeling is that just recycling the existing women who already sit on boards is not going to solve the business issue of expanding and breaking the glass ceiling.BRENDAN TREMBATH: Your company is listed on the stock market in the United States. How does Australia compare with the United States on that front, on the gender balance issue?BRIAN SULLIVAN: Well, we've had a few more years to go after the gender balance issue so we're a little bit further ahead.ELEANOR HALL: That's CTPartners global chief executive Brian Sullivan with Brendan Trembath."

        "webpage": "Rebutting Ron\n\nRon Ross misread \"The Broken State\" in his reply last week (\"Don't Blame Reagan,\" Oct. 29). The lead article did not admit that \"cutting taxes and slashing government regulation will spur private sector economic growth,\" nor did it call for complete economic equality, as he asserts.\n\nIn fact, the illuminating article Ross attacks simply reports the growth of economic inequality over the past 40 years. It stresses the increasing concentration of wealth and power in the hands of highly organized business interests with enormous influence over public opinion and policy. They fight environmental and consumer movements as well as organized labor and advocates for the poor.\n\nApparently, all Ross can see is a \"growth\" whose only measure is profit, not human fulfillment in a healthy environment. He ignores the reality that government is the means by which society defines the rules of economic activity and serves a wide spectrum of essential human needs beyond markets, not the least being national security.\n\nFree market ideology is really a cover for control of government by powerful business interests that make massive use of tax money for their own purposes. That's what \"The Broken State\" is all about  -  showing how California came to its present disgraceful budget crisis.\n\nChuck Harvey, Fieldbrook\n\nEditor:\n\nWell, Ron Ross, who did get us in this mess? You have not given us any hope on this front. My family were all teachers, and Reagan, you see, was bad news to education. That equated to bad news for children in school. Somehow you must have missed this part of the story.\n\nReagan's trickle-down economics really worked well if I recall. Get real. It worked about as well as deregulation of the phone company. Now phones last about one year instead of 25. Same story with airline deregulation  -  way better service and no troubles or bailouts now, right?\n\nSpeaking of service, that's exactly what our kids will be doing as this great state's education system has benefited so well from Regan economics. With the lack of educational opportunities our kids will be working extra hard. When I was a kid our state had one of the best educational systems; now it's at the bottom of the list. If you think Reagan had nothing to do with this decline you are wearing blinders to history. But I'm sure Fed Ex can send some new blinders that will keep distorting the truth  -  maybe, just maybe, for 44 cents.\n\nMark Cortright, Arcata\n\nEditor:\n\nAgain, wonderful job getting varying perspectives on an important issue of the time. While reading Ron Ross' article defending Reagan-era slashanomics in California, I couldn't help but gag at a number of arguments he made. In particular, I want to focus on taxes. Ross writes, \"The fantasy that corporations are capable of paying taxes is one of the most na\u00efve beliefs of the left. In the real world, only humans are capable of paying taxes.\"\n\nThe theory behind taxes is that the government requires cash in order to create and maintain infrastructure, including roads and bridges, and a safe environment (i.e. the military and police). Unless I'm mistaken, corporations, in order to engage in regular business, either use roads or require that people use them in order to patron their establishments. They also depend on law enforcement to protect their businesses from being robbed or destroyed by criminals. Is Ross suggesting that corporations shouldn't pay their due like every other person using the same services?\n\nSpeaking of persons, does Ross forget the concept of corporate personhood, advocated by large railroad and oil companies in the 19th century, that elevated corporations to a status of virtual godliness in our society? Once the courts accepted the premise, a corporation acquired the same rights under the U.S. Constitution as a \"person,\" including the right to engage in free speech, the right to due process and the right to sue. Since corporations are people in the eyes of the law, and people have to pay taxes  -  so should a corporation.\n\nBelieve me, I want to tear all of Ross' arguments apart, but this rebuttal alone will suffice to counter Ross' elite-driven propaganda that the public does not have a right to govern, for the well-being of all Americans, the often profit-driven, if not destructive, practices of large corporations.\n\nRemember, when this country was founded, corporations were subservient legal entities bound to serving the public interest, and if they didn't, goodbye charter. We need to bring those days back."

Banks need to attract deposits to remain competitive in today?s financial marketplace. Allowing them to pay interest to their business customers will help.\"\nThe Business Checking Freedom Act, H.R. 1009, introduced by Rep. Patrick J. Toomey (PA), was approved by a voice vote. The bill would repeal the Depression-era ban prohibiting banks from paying interest on business checking account deposits.\nThe legislation would especially benefit small businesses, which have disproportionately suffered because they are often unable to take advantage of complex banking mechanisms used to skirt the ban.\nRep. Toomey said, \"Small business owners ought to earn interest on their money just like everyone else. It?s time to adapt this Depression-era law to the realities of the 21st Century.\"\nThe Small Business Interest Checking Act, H.R. 974, introduced by Oversight and Investigations Chair Sue W.

Credit unions also experienced a drop in 2010 before bouncing back to a record high of 87% in 2011.\nThe ACSI rates companies at the national level and measures customer satisfaction across 10 economic sectors, 47 industries including e-commerce and e-business and more than 230 companies and federal or local government agencies on a 100-point scale.\nAlthough customer satisfaction with credit unions declined, the ACSI said the industry remains best in class for financial services and displays the top customer satisfaction benchmark among all service categories covered in the ACSI.\nMoreover, credit unions continue to do better than small banks in customer satisfaction, while outperforming all of the big banks by a wide margin, according to the ACSI.\n\"Like small banks, credit unions offer more personalized service and fewer fees. This year, however, an influx of new clients causes credit unions to retreat from their past lofty standards for customer service,\" the ACSI index noted.\nStill, because of a change toward more fees and higher minimum balance requirements, the ACSI said this could be worrisome given the industry's weaker customer service this year.\n\"The large influx of new customers for credit unions, many of whom left banks because of rising fees, poses new challenges for customer service,\" said Claes Fornell, ACSI founder. \"The question becomes how to best serve a fast-growing customer franchise. The more customers you have, the more difficult it gets.\"\nMeanwhile, banks have improved their customer satisfaction score since last year from 75 to 77. The ACSI said the higher score is mostly the result of continued high customer satisfaction with smaller banks, which have gained market share and therefore impact the industry average more in 2012. Smaller banks, defined as those banks outside of the big four of Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, scored 79.\nThe other improvement factor for banks is a 6% increase in customer satisfaction for JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank. JPMorgan Chase leads big banks with a score of 74, but still trails the small banks, which tend to offer more personalized service, free checking, and lower fees, according to the index.\nOther big banks have had to deal with deteriorating customer satisfaction, the ACSI discovered. Compared to 2011's figures, Wells Fargo slid 3% to 71 and Citigroup retreated 4% to 70. Bank of America dropped 3% to 66, reaching its lowest level of customer satisfaction in over a decade, the data showed.\n\"The total fees from overdraft charges alone in 2011, most of them from big banks, amounted to more than $30 billion,\" Fornell said. \"Customers increasingly are rejecting the ever-mounting fees charged by large banks and taking their business to credit unions instead.\"\nFornell said Bank of America, in particular, stands out as the only bank that is still below its prerecession customer satisfaction level.\n\"It is clear that this is mostly because of fees. Customer satisfaction was probably set to deteriorate further as additional fees were in the making until a few weeks ago, when BoA backed away from the idea,\" Fornell noted. Show Comments"

        "webpage": "Core Conundrum for Investors: Bonds or Stocks? Bruce W. Fraser,|Special to CNBC.com Monday, 18 Jun 2012 | 6:44 AM ET\nAs the sovereign debt debacle in Europe slogs along, and with the global economic recoveryseemingly stalled out, investors and analysts are sizing up a drastically reshaped global landscape. cnbc.com\nIn this increasingly volatile market, some see stocks as having much better prospects than bonds, assuming Europe rights itself and the economic recovery finally takes off. Others believe the three-decade bull market for bonds still has legs. A lot may depend on your inflation outlook  -  but bonds, particularly Treasurys, have performed so well for so long, it's hard to think fixed income is the horse to ride. At the same time, stocks have been full of disappointment lately, and investors are much more risk-conscious today. Still, the sky hasn't fallen  -  at least not yet. Consequently, is a bull market in stocks hiding around the bend? Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist, S&P Capital IQ, accepts the premise that stocks look attractively valued for the long term, but he's generally cautious, citing many problems, particularly in Europe. Currently, he says, investors would rather play it safe and stick with a more conservative portfolio and investment outlook. Long-Term vs. Short-Term\n\"Investors who have U.S. Treasurys are not convinced that now is the time to sell, as their primary goal is the return of their money rather than the return on their money,\" he says. \"They're not looking for capital appreciation or income; they just want their money to be safe.\" That perceived safety of bonds could prove illusory at these levels, according to Larry Luxenberg, a financial adviser with Lexington Avenue Capital Management in New City, N.Y. \"While these short-term fluctuations in stocks can be unnerving, the long-term potential of stocks remains attractive,\" says Luxenberg. \"Investors have gotten conditioned to be too pessimistic about stocks, and they need to consider the possibility that there could be a brighter future for equities.\"\nIndeed, investors today remain confused because although stocks look attractively valued for the long term, their emotions are whipsawed by almost daily fluctuations in the global equity markets and constant reminders that another Lehman-like catastrophecould be brewing in Europe. At the same time, they are being advised by bond experts that Treasury bonds are likely the next bubble. \"Investors also have to realize that when it comes to 'news,' if it bleeds, it leads, meaning bloody stories sell,\" adds Stovall. The bond market has consistently trumped returns from stocks over the past decade. From Dec. 31, 1999, through May 29, 2012, the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate bond index  -  which covers the investment-grade bond market, including government and corporate bonds as well as mortgage- and other asset-backed securities  -  returned 104.1 percent to investors. By comparison, thetotal return of the S&P 500 was 14.2 percent, including share price gains and dividends. No wonder, then, that many investors today prefer the merry-go-round to the market roller-coaster. If the world economy worsens, corporate profits could as well. Investors are not heartened by stock market valuations that are trading at a discount to long-term average price-to-earnings ratios, according to Stovall. For instance, the S&P 500 index is trading at 13.2 times trailing 12-month operating earnings. That's a 26 percent discount to the median P/E of the last 25 years.\nRole Reversal Time\nSome market watchers say enough is enough, though.\n\"Investor behavior is paradoxical. It's mathematically impossible for bonds to keep appreciating anything like they have over the past several years,\" says financial planner Jonathan M. Bergman, citing financial guru Jeremy Siegel, author of \"Stocks for the Long Run.\" \"With rates at record lows, there's no place for long-term bond prices to go but down,\" says Bergman, vice president of Scarsdale, N.Y.-based Palisades Hudson Financial Group. Vote\n\"Stocks are very cheap,\" adds Charles Rotblut, editor of the AAII (American Association of Individual Investors) Journal. \"But we are facing a situation where things could go right or they could go wrong. So, while stocks look very attractive over the long-term, there are issues that could hurt their short-term returns.\" Of course, for some money managers, the question should not be framed as either/or.\n\"We see increased risk in both stocks and bonds compared to a few years prior,\" says Jaime Desmond, COO, Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. \"Instead of predicting which has a brighter future, we prefer to diversify our risk away from both asset classes through inclusion of alternative investments.\" At the same time he warns investors to be judicious because except for Treasury bonds, most other fixed-income assets have been moving in tandem with the equity markets, diminishing their diversification benefits.

        "webpage": "Today's Wall Street Not Much Different From 2008\nShare Tweet E-mail Comments Print By NPR Staff Top European finance officials met again Sunday in Brussels to try and prevent a financial collapse and save the continent from its debt crisis. Europe's debt situation differs from what happened in 2008 in the U.S., where banks lent money to fuel an unsustainable housing boom. Still, a default in Europe could have serious consequences on Wall Street and on global markets. As the European markets get closer to a meltdown and the echoes of the 2008 banking crisis still resonate in the U.S., has anything changed on Wall Street in the past few years? The Dow Jones industrial average recently reached a three-month high. Despite high unemployment, many on Wall Street are still making big money, says Jesse Eisinger, who covers finance for ProPublica. Eisinger tells Guy Raz, host of weekends on All Things Considered, that though the Dodd-Frank financial oversight law tries to prevent Wall Street banks from doing the sort of proprietary trading that led to the financial crisis, it doesn't mean it's not still happening. \"They can't do that as much, which leads to being less profitable,\" Eisinger says. \"But they're still doing a lot of trading for their own account  -  it's just much harder to see.\" The ecosystem of financial institutions funding other financial institutions without any larger societal benefit is unsustainable, Eisinger says. He says the current caution on Wall Street created by the Dodd-Frank law is going to be temporary unless there's serious structural change to the financial system. \"We didn't break up the banks; we didn't make them smaller -- we just asked them to change their behavior,\" he says. \"That works maybe for a couple of years ... but that won't work in the long term.\" Still Too Big To Fail Though many ordinary people have lost millions, it's business as usual for the large investment firms. For example, investment banking giant Goldman Sachs announced a quarterly loss last week  -  just the second time since 1999 it has posted a loss; yet Goldman still set aside more than $10 billion for year-end bonuses. Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who also served as New York's attorney general, says small investors do not get a fair shake on Wall Street. \"Small investors are sold stuff that they should not be sold,\" Spitzer tells Raz. \"They have sold a product to the public and then bet against it -- they have designed it to fail.\" Large investment firms have access to IPOs, stocks and information, among other things, in order to make money, Spitzer says. He says these advantages create conflicts of interest in the products they create for small investors. \"I spent many years as attorney general trying to root out the inherent conflicts of interests,\" he says. \"[The people] who put together these products may have one thing in mind that may not be in the best interest of the person who was sold that product.\" In a recent article for the online magazine Slate, Spitzer says the Occupy Wall Street movement has \"shaken up American politics.\" He says it has helped re-inject the issue of income inequality, jobs and equity into the political discussion, which until now has been focused solely on debt reduction. Although Wall Street might be an easy target for critics of the financial crisis, Spitzer, like Eisinger, says it's the very structure that is the problem. He says structural reforms in the financial industry are the first critical step in dealing with equity and growth issues. \"We still have major institutions that are more concentrated now than they used to be,\" he says. \"Have we made some progress? Sure, but not enough.\"Copyright 2011 National Public Radio. To see more, visit . View the discussion thread."

        "webpage": "Pre-Retirees, Retirees Have Different Ideas About Life After Work ING surveys find misconceptions about retirement among still-working investors\nSurvey results released Thursday by ING U.S. found that pre-retirees may be in for a rude awakening when they stop working. Although just 8% said they expect to have a lower standard of living in retirement than they do currently, 33% of retired respondents said they've had to cut back now that they aren't working.\nIn a separate survey conducted online by ING in June, 80% of respondents said they would rather tighten their purse strings now to guarantee income in retirement. Almost 40% still expected to run out of money in retirement. That might not be very surprising, though, considering over a third of respondents think they can retire comfortably with $500,000.\nING surveyed 850 adults over age 30 for the phone poll in early June. The online poll gathered responses from about 2,400 consumers in mid-June and early July. Results from both surveys were released simultaneously.\nING found that advisors were a significant factor in respondents' confidence. Almost 90% of respondents who work with an advisor said they've calculate what their current savings mean for their monthly income in retirement, compared to 59% of those without an advisor. While 37% of respondents thought it likely that they'd run out of money in retirement, among those without an advisor, 41% had the same fear.\n\"Don't get me wrong; change is good and we all hope to get to that point at some time, but without some help, a retiree can easily get thrown off course,\" Rich Linton, president of individual markets for ING U.S., said in a presentation discussing the surveys' results.\nOne of the greatest obstacles to retirement planning is inertia, Linton said. \"Retirement planning is complicated, it's not an immediate need for me today, or frankly, it's not interesting to an individual so they put it off,\" he said.\nAn advisor's value starts, then, with helping investors get over those obstacles, he added. One way for advisors to do that, according to Linton, is to help frame retirement in a way that makes it tangible and relevant to today.\nLinton said that retirement savings are not one goal, but three: \"It's about understanding your needs, your wants and your wishes.\"\nHe stressed that advisors should focus on life stages to help frame retirement planning. For example, a younger client may have student debt they're still paying off, and may need help seeing past those obligations to plan for retirement.\nRick Mason, president of corporate markets, addressed the role plan sponsors play in retirement planning. He said 12% of sponsors currently offer an income solution in their fund line-up, and that is expected to double over the next year. \"It shows there's an increase in focus on helping participants connect their savings to income,\" Mason said.\nHe suggested applying some of the automatic features that have helped investors in the accumulation phase could benefit those in the decumulation phase as well.\n\"Employers are going to be increasingly involved in advancing retirement readiness in the work force, not just because employees are asking for it, but because employers are being increasingly looked at by policymakers to play a greater role.\"\nThey also stand to benefit, though, because when employees aren't ready to retire, it can drive up health care costs and keep older workers in positions instead of advancing younger workers.\nRich Linton\nincome solution"

        "webpage": "Unemployment and Its Symptoms\nColin Gordon \u25aa July 18, 2013 If the recession were a bout of the flu, we would be at about that point where the fever has broken - but we still feel like throwing up most of the time. The \"recovery,\" now in its fifth year, has yet to deliver the kind of job or wage growth sufficient to lend the term anything but the narrowest technical meaning. Things are no longer getting worse, but they are not getting much better either.\nThe simplest and starkest measure, on this score, is the glacial progress of job recovery - which so far has barely kept pace with those joining or returning to the labor force. But that is only part of the story. Unemployment has been accompanied by a number of troubling weaknesses in the labor market. And progress on each of these (summarized in the graphic below) has been even slower.\nWhile employment rose from 4.5 to 10 percent as the recession took hold, long-term unemployment (the share of the unemployed who were without work for more than twenty-seven weeks) shot from 16 percent to 45 percent. And while the unemployment rate has slipped back to 7.6 percent, the long-term unemployment share - at 37 percent - is still more than double its pre-recession level.\nIn the weakening labor market, the share of part-time work also rose, from about 16 percent to about 20 percent of all employment. And in the weak recovery, this share has stuck - hovering at around 20 percent ever since. Some workers want part-time work, but it is pretty clear that this is a recessionary hangover. The share of \"involuntary\" part-time workers (those who want full-time work but can't get it) doubled during the recession -  from 16 percent to over 33 percent - and is still around 30 percent.\nSome of this is captured in the underemployment rate, an alternative measure that counts involuntary part-timers and marginally-attached workers (those who are not currently working or looking for work but would if economic conditions were better) alongside the unemployed. The underemployment rate peaked at over 17 percent in late 2009 and early 2010, and - at 14.3 percent - is now near double the conventional unemployment rate.\nFinally, the insured unemployment rate (the share of workers that are unemployed and drawing unemployment benefits) captures the economic and politics of the last business cycle. At the depth of the recession, about 5 percent of the labor force was unemployed and drawing benefits. Today, four years into a recovery punctuated by federal sequestration and a carnival of nastiness in state politics, only 2.3 percent are unemployed and currently covered. The rate of unemployment is falling slowly. But the rate of unemployment that we are doing anything about is dropping like a stone.\nColin Gordon is a professor of history at the University of Iowa.

        "webpage": "A Perceptive PostmortemUBS comes clean on the causes of its whopping write-downs.Karen M. Kroll, CFO MagazineJune 1, 2008\nAlthough only time will tell if it remains at the top of the subprime-loss heap, UBS takes the prize for the most forthcoming mea culpa. In April it published a 50-page document titled \"Shareholder Report on UBS's Write-Downs,\" in which it described how failures in its corporate governance, organizational structure, risk management, and other functions contributed to its losses. \"UBS raised the bar in terms of transparency,\" says Cubillas Ding, a London-based senior analyst with consulting firm Celent.\nUBS may have felt compelled to come clean because its shareholders, used to its solid, stable private-banking business, were rocked by the volatility that has accompanied the firm's move into investment banking. And the firm may have sensed that the time was right to fess up. After all, \"there are few times in history when you can take a $7 billion or $8 billion write-down without anyone blinking an eye,\" says Rob Hegarty, managing director of securities and investments with TowerGroup.\nAmong UBS's action items was a renewed commitment to risk management. While no U.S. firm has followed the Swiss banking giant's lead in terms of detailed explanations of just what went wrong, some are also taking steps to shore up their risk functions. Francis Diebold, professor of economics and co-director of the Wharton Financial Institutions Center at the University of Pennsylvania, says that to date the function \"has been largely a statistical exercise\" to quantify the expected distribution of returns on a particular portfolio. The scope should expand, he says, to include the incentives and structures that underlie deals.\nDiebold adds that the push for a more principles-based approach to regulation may prove valuable. \"It's premature to speculate on the outcome,\" he says, \"but the debate will be and should be very real. The issues that shaped UBS's experience are fascinating and have ramifications for the future of global financial regulations.\""

        "webpage": "Without Key Jobs Data, Markets And Economists Left Guessing By Marilyn Geewax\nOct 3, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email JPMorgan Chase trader Frederick Reimer works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The government's monthly jobs numbers won't be released as scheduled Friday, leaving financial markets without key data to evaluate the economy.\nBrendan McDermid\nOriginally published on October 3, 2013 1:32 pm Stock investors and business journalists unite each month for one shared, suspenseful moment  -  the 8:30 a.m. release of the Labor Department's employment report. The unveiling of the report  -  so rich with data on job creation, unemployment, wages and hours  -  can be counted upon to set off a tsunami of tweets. Economists jump in with instant analysis and politicians fire off press releases with reactions. That market-moving report was due this Friday. But it won't come out  -  leaving Federal Reserve policymakers, investors and job seekers scratching their heads about labor-market conditions. Because of the federal government's partial shutdown, the Labor Department is not releasing its most closely watched report. \"An alternative release date has not been scheduled,\" the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists will have to try reading tea leaves  -  or at least examining less-reliable private reports  -  to get a sense of what the job market did in September. \"You hate to have data delayed because that creates uncertainty,\" said John Canally, an economist for LPL Financial, a Boston-based financial services firm. Not getting that jobs report \"deprives the markets of important information,\" he said. Among economists, the monthly jobs report, compiled by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is considered a \"gold standard\" report. It has a long history and a broad reach, including information from both employers and members of households. On Thursday, economists did get one government-generated report with the release of data on initial claims for unemployment compensation. The first-time claims increased by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 308,000 last week. Economists had forecast 314,000 new claims would be filed, so the report suggests the job market was a bit stronger than most people had thought. That report, based on state data, may continue to be published throughout the shutdown. Unfortunately for economists, other reports from the BLS and Commerce Department will go dark for the duration. For example, on Tuesday, Commerce failed to issue its usual construction spending report. Next Tuesday, it will not be able to release its scheduled international trade report unless the shutdown ends. The loss of such reports is particularly damaging to investor confidence at a time when the Fed is considering a major policy shift, according to Robbert van Batenburg, market strategist for Newedge, a global financial services firm based in Paris. For years, the Fed has been holding down interest rates, waiting for signs that the economy is improving. The time for that policy shift is just about now. But exactly when the Fed will change direction will depend on the strength of the job market. Investors are aware of \"the data dependency of the Fed, and the Fed leans toward using government data,\" van Batenburg said. Translation: When we all know the Fed is using BLS data to set policy, then we're all on the same page. If the Fed starts relying on information from less reliable sources, then things will get even more confusing for investors trying to guess what Fed policymakers are thinking. Even worse, the loss of key government reports means Fed officials are more likely to make a bad call about the direction of the economy, he said. \"The more data you have across the spectrum, the better your decision-making,\" he said. Still, if the shutdown lasts only a short while, investors and economists will be able to make their forecasts with the help of private reports. The monthly ADP National Employment Trends report, for example, offers an assessment of private-sector jobs issued by the payroll-processing company. On Wednesday, ADP said the private sector created 166,000 jobs in September. That report is not as complete as the BLS monthly snapshot, which counts government workers such as firefighters and teachers, but it's becoming widely followed as a supplement to the government data. On Thursday, another closely watched private report was issued. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas said companies announced plans for 40,289 layoffs in September. That's 20 percent fewer job cuts than in August. Other reports that carry weight among economists include: Standard and Poor's Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Home Price Index; Markit's Purchasing Purchasing Managers' Index; the International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs Retail Chain Stores Sales Index; the Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing ISM index and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index. \"In the short term, you can live without the government reports,\" van Batenburg said. But over time, the loss of the best data will erode confidence that the Fed policymakers and investment advisers are making informed judgments. \"It all depends on the duration of the shutdown,\" he said.Copyright 2013 NPR.

        "webpage": "Taxes and the End of DOMA: Married in the Eyes of the IRS By striking down key provisions of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) on June 26, the Supreme Court has brought about a major change in the way same-sex couples will be viewed in the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service.\nIn almost all areas of the Internal Revenue Code - from federal income tax to estate planning - the law carves out special rules that apply for married couples filing joint tax returns. While the ruling does not mean that all states must recognize same-sex marriages, it does mean that the federal government - including the IRS - will be required to treat those same-sex marriages that are recognized as valid for purposes of federal law.\nWhile the ruling obviously represents a major step toward equality in general, in some areas, such as estate and Social Security planning, the ruling also represents a big win (tax-wise) for same-sex couples. High income same-sex clients, however, need to be prepared for the reality that their tax bills might be going up this year.\nFederal estate tax rules have evolved in recent years to make it easier for married couples to avoid taxes when passing wealth after death. Same-sex clients will now be able to take advantage of these special rules. For example, the $5.25 (in 2013) exemption is automatically portable between spouses, meaning that same-sex couples can now count on shielding a combined $10.5 million from estate taxes without worrying about which spouse technically owns the assets.\nSimilarly, in the gift tax arena, married couples are permitted to pool their $14,000 (in 2013) annual gift tax exclusion so that each couple is able to make annual tax-free gifts of up to $28,000 per donee.\nSame-sex couples may reap the greatest win based on their entitlement to Social Security spousal benefits under federal law. A married spouse who never worked (or who is not ready to begin claiming benefits) is still entitled to claim Social Security spousal benefits when his or her spouse uses the \"file and suspend\" strategy.\nUnder this strategy, one spouse files for benefits and immediately suspends those benefits after the second spouse begins claiming spousal benefits. This allows the couple to claim some Social Security benefits while allowing their earnings-based retirement benefits to grow.\nThe federal income tax arena is where higher earning same-sex couples may experience a larger tax bill. Under the legislation enacted early in 2013, a single taxpayer crosses the earnings threshold into the 39.6% tax bracket when he or she earns more than $400,000 for the year - meaning that two \"single\" (in the eyes of federal law) taxpayers could live together and earn almost $800,000 before entering the highest tax bracket. Two \"married\" people, on the other hand, become subject to this rate when they have combined earnings of only $450,000 for the year.\nSimilarly, a same-sex couple whose marriage is not federally recognized can earn $400,000 ($200,000 each) before their itemized deductions and personal exemptions become subject to the phase-out rules that gradually reduce their value. Once that same couple's marriage is federally recognized, the penalties kick in at $250,000 - total.\nThe investment income tax, which is new for 2013, will also apply to a married couple earning a combined $250,000 (while a same-sex couple whose marriage was not federally recognized could earn $400,000 before crossing the threshold).\nSumming Up\nThe end of DOMA obviously represents a huge victory for same-sex couples and it is a major step on the road to equality. Higher earning same-sex clients, however, need to be prepared for the reality that their tax bills might be going up now that they are married in the eyes of the IRS.\nFor additional coverage of this issue and similar ones, we invite you to sign up with AdvisorOne's Summit Business Media partner, National Underwriter Advanced Markets, for a free trial.\nYou may also be interested in signing up for a free trial with another Summit Business Media partner, Tax Facts Online.\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

        "webpage": "A Fond Farewell To Fed Chairman Ben\nShare Tweet E-mail Comments Print By John Ydstie Originally published on Thu January 30, 2014 9:00 am\nListen Transcript AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Ben Bernanke steps down this week as chairman of the Federal Reserve. The new chair, Janet Yellen, will take over on Saturday. After a two-day meeting, the message today from Fed policymakers was simple: Stay the course. The Fed released a statement saying it will continue dialing-back its stimulus. NPR's John Ydstie has more on that decision and Bernanke's legacy. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: Fed policymakers said they will reduce their monthly stimulus by another $10 billion. And they justified the move by noting that the economy is growing moderately and the job market is improving. But they indicated again that they'll keep short-term interest rates near zero, at least until the unemployment rate falls below six and a half percent. It was Ben Bernanke's final meeting as chairman, and in assessing his legacy, it's useful to divide his tumultuous tenure into three periods, starting with the pre-crisis days of 2006 and 2007. During that period, the Bernanke Fed took a hands-off approach, says Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman Alan Blinder. ALAN BLINDER: The Fed basically did nothing in the early Bernanke days, just as it has done nothing in the Greenspan days, to curtail the crazy mortgage lending that was going on all over the country. YDSTIE: And it was slow to reduce interest rates as the housing bubble burst. But, says Harvard economist Ken Rogoff, in the second act, Bernanke's response was masterful, as the financial system melted down in 2008. KEN ROGOFF: Overwhelmingly, Ben Bernanke's most importance contribution is he steered us through the depths of the financial crisis, when it could have been really awful. It was bad but we could have experienced the Second Great Depression. There's no doubt about it. YDSTIE: Rogoff says the creative ways Bernanke saved Wall Street banks, money market funds, and the commercial paper market that provides critical daily funding for U.S. companies, will be studied by economists for 100 years. Blinder agrees Bernanke was very skillful during the crisis, with one exception. He says the Fed chairman should have done more to keep the big Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers from failing. Bernanke has been countering that criticism since Lehman's collapse, including in this \"60 Minutes\" interview from back in March of 2009. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED AUDIO) BEN BERNANKE: There were many people who said: Let them fail; you know, it's not a problem - the markets will take care of it. And I think I knew better than that. And Lehman proved that you cannot let a large internationally active firm fail in the middle of a financial crisis. Now, was it a mistake? It wasn't a mistake for the following reason: We did not have the option. We didn't have the tools. YDSTIE: Bernanke said the Fed could only lend to firms that put up solid collateral and Lehman didn't have enough. The Bernanke Fed's policies ultimately stabilized the financial system, but getting the basic economy back to normal remains a challenge. The Fed has tried to help stimulate the economy with its quantitative easing aimed at lowering long-term interest rates. Rogoff says the jury is still out on how successful that's been. ROGOFF: You can certainly debate the quantitative easing. I mean I'm sort of the school they actually should have done more. YDSTIE: Others say the Fed's stimulus efforts are dangerous and could produce financial bubbles and inflation. Bernanke responds that the policy has lowered interest rates and helped the housing and auto sectors recover. Meanwhile, inflation remains historically low and Bernanke says he doesn't see any bubbles developing. In a public appearance recently at the Brookings Institution, Bernanke said his goal was to help Main Street, not Wall Street. BERNANKE: We hope that as the economy improves, and as we tell our story, that people will appreciate and understand that what we did was necessary; that it was in the interest of the broader public. It was aimed at helping the average American. YDSTIE: Given the challenges that Bernanke faced and the extraordinary policies he employed, it's likely his legacy will remain a topic of debate for years to come. John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington.

        "webpage": "Economy, health care key issues for swing-state voters\nThis year's presidential race between Democratic incumbent President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, is being hailed as the most important since the 1960 battle between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.\nA sound, job-producing economy and health care are key issues in the Obama-Romney race. Colorado is a swing state in this election, and both candidates are fighting to earn the state's nine electoral votes. Many Coloradans are divided over the two issues.\nBoth candidates want to improve the country's economy by changing the ways citizens are taxed. Obama wants to keep in place some tax cuts that were made during the administration of George W. Bush, but just for individuals who earn less than $200,000 a year and married couples who earn less than $250,000 a year. People who make more money would see their taxes go up.\nRomney wants to keep the Bush tax cuts in place for everyone and make a \"permanent, across-the-board 20 percent cut,\" according to . That would bring the top individual tax rate of 35 percent down to 28 percent.\nObama's No. 1 goal for the coming four years is to decrease the number of people who are out of work. Throughout his term as president, his administration added 4.6 million jobs, according to a recent USA Today article. The president has not kept his promise to bring the level of unemployment to 5.4 percent. Unemployment currently stands at 8.3 percent, a statistic that does not sit well with many people.\nErin Lielkoks, a senior at Grand Junction High School, is among those Americans.\n\"I feel discouraged,\" Lielkoks said. \"My job contributes to my family's livelihood. It's part of the government's responsibilities to help make sure that I can take care of my family, and by not being able to find a job, that's not happening.\"\nObama wants to increase American jobs \"by eliminating tax breaks for U.S. companies that ship jobs overseas and creating incentives for businesses to bring jobs back to America,\" according to .\nAccording to , Romney wants to build America's workforce in two ways. First, he wants to retrain American workers \"to ensure that they have the education and skills to match the jobs of today's economy.\" Second, a Romney administration would have an immigration policy that would be of interest to immigrants who are highly skilled.\n\"The United States needs to attract and retain job creators from wherever they come. Foreign-born residents with advanced degrees start companies, create jobs, and drive innovation at an especially high rate,\" according to the website. Along with the nation's economic woes, health care also has been hotly debated ever since the president introduced his Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) and the House of Representatives and Senate narrowly passed it in 2010. Though the Supreme Court deemed the act constitutional in March, House Republicans passed a bill that repealed it. That bill, however, did not pass through the Senate, and so the law remains in place.\nRepublicans, Romney among them, have expressed disapproval of Obamacare. \"What the court did not do on its last day in session,\" Romney said of the March 28 decision, \"I will do on my first day if elected. I will act to repeal Obamacare.\"\nThe president's position, though, is that the Affordable Care Act increases citizens' access to health care, makes health care more affordable, and ends abuses by insurance companies such as capping or dropping coverage when people become ill, according to the president's official website.\nCaleb Gartner, a GJHS senior who calls himself a moderate (a mix between the two parties) has positive thoughts on the act. Without it, he would be denied insurance because of a pre-existing health problem.\n\"It helps keep families trying to cover major medical expenses from going bankrupt,\" he said. \"Obviously, there are downsides to it. Nothing's perfect, especially when insurance is involved. A good compromise leaves everybody unhappy.\"\nGartner will be of age to vote on Nov. 6. He will be among the Coloradans weighing these and other issues as they cast \"swing-state\" votes that will be closely watched on election night.\nZachary Barger is a student at Grand Junction High School and is reporting on election issues for The Daily Sentinel in conjunction with Kids Voting of Mesa County."

        "webpage": "Obama's Fiscal Task Force Has Too Much to Handle\nWASHINGTON -- When presidents can't make the tough decisions on the vexing problems that confront government, they pass the buck by appointing a commission to come up with some answers.\nThat's what President Obama did with his executive order to create a bipartisan task force to cut the budget deficit, which is expected to hit $1.6 trillion this year and can only be expected to rise under his spending policies.\nThe president is essentially admitting he can't stop his spending addiction and needs counseling from one of those debt-resolution services people use when they have maxed out their credit cards. His task force is doomed to fail for a number of reasons.\nFirst and foremost, Congress is under no obligation to accept any of its proposals and probably won't. Democrats pushed legislation to set up a similar congressionally mandated commission, but the bill failed to draw necessary support when a group of Republican senators turned against it, discovering that the panel would attempt to cut the deficit by raising taxes on what remains an anemic economy still struggling to recover. That was a nonstarter.\nPolls show that a majority of American people are deeply troubled by the massive pileup in debts by this administration and this Congress, and want deficit reduction to be a major priority. But the Democratic majority is seemingly incapable of saying no to more spending. The pending health care bill, tipping the scales at $1 trillion, is the latest manifestation of this.\nSecond, the Constitution gives Congress sole power over the federal government's spending levels. No outside, unelected body is going to be able to step into the breach to do what the president and the majority party in Congress refuse to do: slow down the growth in federal spending while the economy gets back on its feet and tax revenues begin rising again as a result of sustained increases in the nation's economic growth.\nWhen Obama's proposed task force plan foundered on Capitol Hill for lack of support, he set up one of his own. It was a stunning admission of his own inabilities to exert executive leadership over the federal budget. And it didn't exactly win rave reviews.\n\"President Obama's budget deficit task force is clever politics but poor leadership. Instead of drafting a responsible budget, he seeks to force Republicans to endorse wasteful spending and higher taxes, or be cast as obstructionists,\" writes University of Maryland economist Peter Morici in a recent critique of Obama's budgetary shell game.\nIt's worth noting that the deficit under former President Bush, who Morici notes was \"no model of austerity,\" fell in fiscal 2007 to a mere $161 billion from over $400 billion, just before federal tax revenues plunged as a result of the Great Recession.\nSharply declining tax revenues, the $700 billion bank bailout, Obama's now nearly $900 billion so-called stimulus package, and the Democrats' record-shattering omnibus budget bill that was loaded with unprecedented pork-filled earmarks drove the budget deficits to $1.4 trillion last year and to repeat -- because it bears endless repeating -- $1.6 trillion this year.\nWhen he unveiled his fiscal 2011 budget, the news media made much of his proposed freeze on non-defense discretionary spending. But it was delayed until next year at the earliest and in the end, wouldn't make even a dent in the deficit -- maybe $25 billion -- if Congress accepts his proposals.\nObama isn't into budget cutting. He's into budget growing, and he's made this clear many times when he tells Americans that this or that big spending plan is \"paid for.\" What he means is that he will raise taxes to bring in more revenue to spend and eventually that means higher taxes on the middle class.\nThat's what he expects from this presidential commission, and he emphasized it earlier this month in an interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek.\nDespite his repeated vow throughout his 2008 presidential campaign that he would not raise taxes on individuals making less than $200,000 or households making less than $250,000, Obama now says he's \"agnostic\" about raising taxes on people making less.\n\"The whole point of it is to make sure that all ideas are on the table\" and that every option is considered, including tax increases, he said.\nIn the end, whatever Obama's task force comes up with, it's going to run into a fiscal brick wall called weak economic growth, which means lower tax revenue receipts, which in turn means higher deficits than are presently forecast.\nThe administration assumes GDP growth of about 3 percent this year and 4 percent after that in its projections of slightly lower deficits by mid-decade. But the Congressional Budget Office projects very tepid growth rates of less than 2 percent. \"Most economists believe Obama's growth economic assumptions are too optimistic and deficits will be bigger than projected,\" Morici says.\nThey will indeed, until we curb spending and give the U.S. economy a permanent transfusion of lower tax rates to fuel business expansion and new job growth. That will restore solvency to the government and needed long-term growth to our economy."

Araya Diaz/Getty Images for TechCrunch\nScott Anthony, who runs venture investing for Innosight  -  a consulting firm founded by the founder of \"disruptive innovation,\" Clayton Christensen  -  has applied the master's lessons to the venture capital space at Harvard Business Review's blog. Like a lot of folks, myself included, he takes a recent Kauffman Foundation report as his starting point. And then he effectively deploys Christensen's best-known concept to explain why venture capital  -  and particularly big VC funds  -  isn't performing as well as an investment class as it has in the past. The way disruptive innovation works is that in an established industry, a new player will enter at the low end and wind up disrupting the major players.\nA good example might be Japanese carmakers attacking first small motorcycles and later small cars, then moving up the food chain to make plenty of trouble for Ford and General Motors. More recently, you could argue that Instagram did this to Facebook by creating a lightweight mobile photo-sharing app that was so easy to use that it acquired 50 million users practically overnight. In VC, something similar appears to be at work:\nChristensen likes to describe how, in the early stage of theory development, people make predictions based on observed correlations. For example, people observed that things that flew had feathers. So people hoping to fly created large feathered wings. More advanced theories pinpoint causal mechanisms. For flight, that was Bernoulli's Principle, a theory that explained the concept of lift and why modern aircraft are not covered in feathers.\nMuch of the venture capital industry seems stuck in the feathers-and-wings stage of theory development. Many successful venture capitalists observe directional patterns. \"Every time I have succeeded,\" they might think, \"I've backed an 'A team,' that has targeted a hot market space.\" There's no doubt that's true, but that is a statement of correlation, not causality. Even worse, the narrative fallacy means that people are likely to construct stories about the past that might not have been precisely true, making future predictions even more dubious.\nHe goes on to discuss how this doesn't mean that venture capital should close up shop, but rather get acquainted with what he calls \"trifurcation.\" There will be big VC firms, the well-known names from Silicon Valley and perhaps a few in other regions that have established startup economies.\nThere will be data-driven operations like Google Ventures, which among other things is crunching numbers on whether failure is worth investing in (failure is often taken as a hard-earned and much-desired battle scar in the tech startup world). And there will be incubators that can bust out startups in a hurry, to try to catch lightning in a bottle in the new fast-paced innovation paradigm.\nIt's interesting to think that an industry (of sorts) that prides itself on being the innovation expert is being exposed to Christensenian disruption. But it shouldn't be surprising. VC has been around for decades. It has undoubtedly funded great companies that have inculcated entrepreneurship and created substantial market value. But like everything else, VC isn't immune to \"creative destruction\"  -  the famous and famously misunderstood process, identified by economist Joseph Schumpeter, by which old economic structures are displaced by new ones. Venture capital exists in capitalism  -  and exists because of capitalism  -  and what we may be witnessing is the leading edge of a major change in how it's organized. One issue is that industries aren't supposed to be able to disrupt themselves. Outside players need to come in at the bottom of the market. This suggests that if a trifurcated VC model doesn't succeed, something different  -  something faster and cheaper  -  may arrive that funds companies in wholly new and unexpected ways.\nOC Register and six other papers are sold to investor group"

RUGABERAP Economics WriterWASHINGTONThe number of Americans seeking unemployment aid plummeted to a five-year low last week, a hopeful sign the job market may be improving. But much of the decline reflects seasonal volatility in the data.\nWeekly unemployment benefit applications fell 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 335,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's the lowest level since January 2008, just after the recession began.\nThe four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell to 359,250.\nThe applications data can be uneven in January. Job cuts typically spike in the second week of the month as retailers, restaurants and other companies lay off temporary workers hired for the winter holidays.\nThe department seasonally adjusts the numbers to account for such trends, but the data can still be choppy.\nLast week, the layoffs weren't as large as expected, a department spokesman said. That caused a steep drop in the seasonally adjusted data.\nThe broader trend will become clearer in the coming weeks. Applications were declining slightly at the end of last year, pushing the four-week average to a four-year low in the last week of December.\nThe applications figures \"suggest the labor market is getting better, the issue remains the extent of the improvement,\" said Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank.\nApplications are a proxy for layoffs. Overall, applications remain at a level that suggests employers are hiring at a slow but steady pace. Applications fluctuated between 360,000 and 390,000 for most of last year. At the same time, employers added an average of 153,000 jobs a month.\nThat's just been enough to slowly push down the unemployment rate, which fell 0.7 percentage points last year to 7.8 percent.\nEmployers added 155,000 jobs last month, nearly matching the average for the year. December's steady job gain suggests employers didn't cut back on hiring in the midst of the debate over the tax and spending changes known as the fiscal cliff. Many economists feared that the prospect of higher taxes and steep cuts in federal spending would cause a slowdown in job gains.\nThat's a good sign, since more budget showdowns are expected. Congress must vote to raise the government's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit by sometime between mid-February and early March. If not, the government risks defaulting on its debt. Republicans will likely demand deep spending cuts as the price of raising the debt limit.\nMore than 5.8 million people received unemployment aid in the week ended Dec. 29, the latest data available. That's about 465,000 more than the previous week. The figure includes about 2 million people who receive extended benefits paid for by the federal government. The rest receive aid under state unemployment programs, which usually last 26 weeks.\nThe overall economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the July-September quarter. But economists believe activity slowed considerably in the October-December quarter to a rate below 2 percent or less, in part because companies cut back on restocking."

Watch the Did-You-Know slideshow\nGeri Terzo\nEdited By: PJP Schroeder\nIn a situation where a business or other organization is using the services of a consulting firm, being assigned the most senior consultants can work to that client's advantage. Senior personnel in any industry tend to posses the most industry experience, possibly in duration but often in the experiences that these personnel have encountered. Time could be saved by using senior consultants because more junior professionals might not have the same authority to make certain decisions. Professionals who have attained senior-consultant status often have reached the pinnacle of respective careers. This designation does not necessarily reflect the number of years invested in an industry. Rather, it is often an indication of the solid industry contacts that have been developed and the level of expertise that consultants have to contribute to clients. The benefits of using senior consultants could be the caliber of the business that is generated from these individuals. Ad\nCompanies turn to consultants for a host of reasons. Sometimes, support is needed from an industry specialist for complex and vital decisions that must be made. A company may not have the internal resources or could lack the expertise for a new endeavor. Business process outsourcing (BPO) is a service that companies use to outsource certain functions of a firm. Consulting firms hire senior consultants to focus solely on identifying and connecting clients with the most appropriate BPO firms either domestically or overseas. Given that consulting firms choose to assign the highly specialized tasks associated with BPO management to senior consultants suggests that the responsibilities associated with performing these tasks are great and require the most experienced professionals.\nIn a financial services setting, institutional investors frequently engage the services of consultants to support the investment process. Consultants might be involved in the day-to-day investment decisions or have more of a supportive role on a less frequent basis. If consultants are hired to help with logistical services that involve receiving and sorting files on behalf of third-party investment firms also engaged by an investor, a junior consultant can typically handle these demands. In the event that a consultant is expected to shape the investment direction of a client, make recommendations, and offer warnings about potential mistakes, the input that senior consultants can provide can be second to none. This is based on the credentials of senior industry professionals. Senior consultants in financial services often earn similar certifications to money managers in order to offer the best possible advice to clients.

Some people said they would struggle to find money for food, while others said they may have to sell up and rent as and when there was any hike in interest rates, according to the study by consumer group the HomeOwners Alliance and conveyancing provider Myhomemove.\nThe research found that 34% of people were worried that a rise in interest rates would mean they faced a tougher struggle to afford payments on their mortgage or other bank loans and debts, equating to 5.8 million homeowners if the findings were projected across the UK.\nYounger homeowners were found to be more fearful of interest rate rises, with nearly half (49%) of 25 to 34-year-olds saying an increase would put them in difficulty, compared with under one quarter (24%) of people aged over 55.\nThe report quoted one person who took part in the study saying: \"At the minute we can just about pay off (the) mortgage and bills with very little spare for food; with increased rates we would struggle to find money for food every month.\" Another participant told the study: \"I have other debts on top of my mortgage.\n\"I will probably be forced to sell and rent.\"\nThe report found that while some older homeowners would welcome the impact that interest rate rise could have in getting them a better return on their savings pots, they were also concerned about the effect on younger people with debt.\nOne older homeowner told the report: \"For me it will not have an impact as I will complete my mortgage soon.\n\"However I am very fearful for my adult children and society at large.\"\nOn a regional basis, the survey of more than 2,500 people, of which around 1,600 own their property, found that homeowners in the East were the most concerned about a rise in interest rates, with 47% of people there saying an increase would make life more difficult.\nThe findings come amid mounting speculation that further steps could be taken to calm the housing market.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported this week that house prices had jumped by 8% over the last year across the UK to reach around \u00a3252,000, and in London they had surged by 17% to \u00a3459,000 on average.\nBank of England governor Mark Carney recently indicated he was ready to take action to cool the market amid concerns over the threat a new property price bubble could pose to the wider economic recovery.\nMr Carney signalled the Bank could adopt a range of measures, including imposing a new \"affordability test\" for borrowers and advising the Government to rein in its Help to Buy scheme, which helps people with 5% deposits to move on or up the property ladder.\nThe Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that it expects any possible steps to limit the housing market will be \"careful\" and \"proportionate\" rather than causing any dramatic change.\nPaula Higgins, chief executive of the HomeOwners Alliance, said: \"Homeowners are already really struggling to make ends meet, and millions could be pushed into real financial hardship when interest rates start to rise. \"It shows just how severe the cost of living crisis is that a rise in interest rates could lead to some homeowners struggling to afford food or being forced to sell their homes. \"The Bank of England needs to tread very carefully to avoid causing widespread financial difficulties.\" Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said: \"Interest rates are at a record low and home ownership is at its most affordable since 2007 thanks to the efforts this Government has made to fix the broken housing market and tackle the deficit we inherited.\n\"Latest figures show repossessions falling and at their lowest in over a decade, but we are far from complacent and would urge anyone to seek advice from their lender early if they have any money worries.\"\n8:54am Fri 23 May 14\nRoll on a rate rise, i have my redundancy money in the bank doing nothing now that i have paid off my mortgage.

McConnell\nExecutive Director,\nBefore the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, and International Security Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, United States Senate\nChairman Coburn, Ranking Member Carper, and Members of the Subcommittee:\nMy name is Jim McConnell and I am the Executive Director of the SEC. The views expressed below and the views I express today are my individual views, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission or the Commissioners, including the Acting Chairman. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the SEC's audited financial statements and facilities budget estimates. Given the SEC's regulatory responsibilities, it is critical that the agency maintain strong financial management practices and that we use taxpayer funds efficiently and effectively. Like many private companies, the SEC has invested tremendous time and energy on examining and bolstering our financial management practices and internal controls. As the regulator overseeing the financial markets and the accounting industry, it is entirely appropriate that we do so. As you know, these efforts have uncovered some weaknesses that we are working aggressively to resolve. Although the audit and internal controls program have presented challenges, we believe that the process will pay dividends in the form of stronger and more effective financial management at the SEC and is an important government-wide initiative.\nAudited Financial Statements\nI would like to begin by discussing the first-ever audit of the SEC's financial statements, conducted under the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002. Because of the SEC's regulatory responsibilities, we selected the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as our auditor. The release of our fiscal 2004 Performance and Accountability Report in May was the culmination of two years of hard work by Commission staff and our GAO auditors. I want to thank them all for their efforts.\nThe good news is that the GAO found that our financial statements were \"presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\" Clean financial statements are quite an achievement for a first-time audit. When the 24 major federal agencies began issuing audited financial statements in 1996, only six received unqualified opinions on their first audit, and many agencies still have not achieved unqualified opinions.\nThe GAO also performed an audit of the SEC's internal controls over financial reporting, and their report concluded that our controls in three areas were not fully effective. Specifically, their report identified material weaknesses in the areas of recording and reporting of disgorgements and penalties, preparing financial statements, and information technology (IT) security. Two of the three issues - IT security controls and disgorgements and penalties - are weaknesses that the agency has been working on for some time and that have been reported previously under the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA). Let me now discuss each of these three areas, and add some general comments.\nDisgorgements and Penalties The first material weakness relates to the controls over our accounting for disgorgements and penalties ordered by courts as a result of SEC enforcement actions. While the judgments awarded by the courts are for specific amounts, the collection is frequently uncertain and requires efforts over a period of years. Let me emphasize that all fines and penalties are accounted for and no payments have been lost. Instead, the GAO found that the SEC did not have a sufficiently comprehensive policy governing the accounting for these amounts, and found inadequate internal controls in the procedures and systems for recording of judgments and the allowance for uncollectible accounts. This is an issue that the SEC has been working on for several years, and we appreciate that the GAO audit report indicated that the SEC has made significant progress in this area. We are currently performing a comprehensive review of our case files and data, and finalizing relevant accounting policies and internal control procedures. We anticipate that consistent application of strengthened internal controls and potentially some limited redesign of the current case tracking system will resolve the material weakness in fiscal 2006. In addition, we are developing plans to implement a multi-year initiative beginning in 2006 to replace the current tracking system. The financial components of the new"

The Court must rule on German plaintiffs' claim that legislation to establish the ESM would violate Germany's Grundgesetz (Basic Law). If the Court rules in the plaintiffs' favor, it will ask Germany's president not to sign the ESM treaty, which has already been ratified by Germany's Bundestag (parliament).There are serious concerns on all sides about the pending decision. Investors are worried that the Court could oppose the ESM such that they would have to bear the losses from their bad investments. Taxpayers and pensioners in European countries that still have solid economies are worried that the Court could pave the way for socialization of eurozone debt, saddling them with the burden of these same investors' losses.The plaintiffs represent the entire political spectrum, including the Left Party, the Christian Social Union MP, Peter Gauweiler, and the justice minister in former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic government, Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, who has collected tens of thousands of signatures supporting her case. There is also a group of retired professors of economics and law, and another of \"ordinary\" citizens, whose individual complaints have been selected as examples by the Court.The plaintiffs have raised several objections to the ESM.First, they claim that it breaches the Maastricht Treaty's \"no bail-out\" clause (Article 125). Germany agreed to relinquish the Deutsche Mark on the condition that the new currency area would not lead to direct or indirect socialization of its members' debt, thus precluding any financial assistance from EU funds for states facing bankruptcy. Indeed, the new currency was conceived as a unit of account for economic exchange that would not have any wealth implications at all.\nThe plaintiffs argue that, in the case of Greece, breaching Article 125 required proof that its insolvency would pose a greater danger than anticipated when the Maastricht Treaty was drafted. However, no such proof was provided.Second, Germany's law on the introduction of the ESM obliges Germany's representative on the ESM Council to vote only after having asked the Bundestag for a decision. According to the plaintiffs, this is not permissible under international law. If Germany had wished to constrain its governor's authority in this way, it should have informed the other signatory states prior to doing so. On the other hand, Germany's representative on the Governing Council is sworn to secrecy, which, the plaintiffs argue, precludes any accountability to the Bundestag.Moreover, the plaintiffs claim that, while the ESM treaty is restrictive in granting resources to individual states, requiring a qualified majority vote, it does not specify the conditions under which losses are acceptable. Losses can result from excessive wages paid by the ESM Governing Council members to themselves, a dearth of energy in efforts to collect debts from countries that have received credit, or other forms of mismanagement. And, because Governing Council and Executive Board members enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution, misbehavior cannot be punished."

In the United States, these hours are typically from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. However, online trading began to rapidly gain popularity in the 1990s, leading to a greater demand for stocks in general, and particularly a demand for the ability to trade stocks after the traditional business hours. A Form T is a form that brokers are required to use to report transactions that occur after the market's usual hours. Trades that occur outside of regular market hours are thus referred to as Form T trades.\nAfter-hours trading had been available for some time to institutional investors and high net worth individuals, but became more widely available in the late 1990s to individual traders with the rise of Electronic Communications Networks (ECNs). If an investor or trader is a customer of a brokerage that has access to an ECN, then they can engage in Form T trades in the after-hours marketplace, which is open an additional two and a half hours after the traditional markets close in the U.S. An ECN acts as the go-between for buyers and sellers in the after-hours market. Ad\nFor the individual as well as the institutional investor, Form T trading does present a few important advantages. If the investor happens to find out something that may have an effect on the price of a stock after hours, they have the convenience of acting on that information immediately. Otherwise, it would be necessary to wait until the markets open again, by which time the information will have reached many more investors, making it harder to profit from the situation. Form T trading also makes buying and selling U.S. stocks more convenient for foreign investors who operate outside the usual hours of trading in the U.S. It should, however, be noted that Form T trading should be done with the utmost caution, especially by the individual investor. The risks may in many cases outweigh the benefits. The biggest drawback of after-hours trading is the lack of liquidity. This simply means that for some stocks, trades become very difficult to execute, and some stocks may not trade very little or not at all during extended hours. Additionally, depending on the broker, an order may not reach all the possible venues where it could be executed, so if it is executed, it may not be at the best possible price. Some investors do feel that the risks of Form T trading are worth the rewards, but it is best suited to those with the most experience in the market.

While U.S. officials, business lobbyists and trade representatives agree that China is not doing enough to let the value of its currency rise, they disagree on what solution works best. Last week, just before U.S. lawmakers took a break before the upcoming November mid-term elections, a bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives approved a bill that could open the way for punitive tariffs on products from China.Supporters of the bill say it has raised the prospect of taking action against China that is long overdue and will finally give the U.S. government more leverage to address the undervaluation of the Chinese currency.Charlie Blum, the executive director of the Fair Currency Coalition, says the bill is a modest first step toward overhaul of U.S. currency policy. \"An overhaul that is badly overdue, an overhaul that if not accomplished soon may contribute to a new round of currency wars similar to that that deepened the great depression [1930],\" he said. \" An overhaul that quite frankly all true free traders should welcome and support.\"Blum made his remarks Thursday at a forum on China's currency sponsored by the Washington International Trade Association. Blum's Fair Currency Coalition is an association of steel, textile and labor groups that have pressed Congress for years on the issue. He and other supporters of legislation argue that diplomatic efforts to resolve the issue have failed.Blum says that while the International Monetary Fund has rules that address currency distortions and their impact on trade, it has little power to compel countries - such as China - to change. Support for currency legislation that seek to punish China is also strong in the U.S. Senate, where a similar bill sponsored by Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, has broad bipartisan support. However, Erin Ennis, vice president of the U.S.- China Business Council says the costs of passing punitive legislation on China's currency outweighs the benefits. \"Those who say the exchange rate has a major impact on the U.S. trade deficit on U.S. jobs are selling Americans a bill of goods [being dishonest, making misleading promises],\" said Ennis. \"The fact is that the products that we make are goods that have not been made in the United States for years.\"Ennis, who also spoke at the meeting on Thursday, says that punishing China with tariffs is unlikely to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States that moved overseas decades ago. She says that not only is it unlikely to get China to change, it also would trigger retaliation that could damage U.S. industries. Ennis notes that 48 hours after the United States announced duties on tires from China last year, China announced anti-dumping tarriffs against U.S. poulty and auto imports.Ennis says her organization's investigation of the impact of that move on the U.S. tire industry revealed that the duties led to an increase in tire prices in America, an increase of their import from other countries and failed to increase overall tire production or boost employment.Gary Horlick, a trade lawyer, says there is no doubt China will respond.\"China will retailate, they've said they will retaliate, they do retaliate, I am counsel for the U.S. poultry industry,\" he said. \"We've been hit with 60 percent duties in retaliation for U.S. duties on tires.\"Ennis says that while a multi-lateral effort to get China to adopt a market driven exchange rate has been moving \"maddenly slow,\" it is the best approach.\"We need to accept the fact that it is a mult-lateral push on this, as the Treasury Department is calling for, that is going to get the action and not unilateral action,\" she said. International pressure against China is building with both the European Union and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner speaking out in recent days, calling on China to let the value of its currency rise.It is a key topic at upcoming meetings this week of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and is expected to be high on the agenda during G-20 meetings in South Korea in November.Just before the last G-20 leaders summit in June, China dropped broke its peg with the dollar, but the currency has only risen about 2 percent in value since then. Some international economists say the Chinese currency is undervalued by as much as 30 percent.On Thursday, China warned that economic ties might be damaged if U.S. lawmakers escalated the conflict over Chinese currency controls.U.S. lawmakers will need to act swiftly if they'd like to get any legislation approved. They only have a brief window to pass legislation after they return from elections in November. If legislation is not approved before the end of the current session of congress, it will die and lawmakers will have to start over."

        "webpage": "Research Topics\n\nPublications on Mesoanalysis\n\nA Mesoanalysis\n\nEconomists' principal explanations of the subprime crisis differ from those developed by noneconomists in that the latter see it as rooted in the US legacy of racial/ethnic inequality, and especially in racial residential segregation, whereas the former ignore race. This paper traces this disjuncture to two sources. What is missing in the social science view is any attention to the market mechanisms involved in subprime lending; and economists, on their side, have drawn too tight a boundary for \"the economic,\" focusing on market mechanisms per se,to the exclusion of the households and community whose resources and outcomes these mechanisms affect. Economists' extensive empirical studies of racial redlining and discrimination in credit markets have, ironically, had the effect of making race analytically invisible. Because of these explanatory lacunae, two defining aspects of the subprime crisis have not been well explained. First, why were borrowers that had previously been excluded from equal access to mortgage credit instead super included in subprime lending? Second, why didn't the flood of mortgage brokers that accompanied the 2000s housing boom reduce the proportion of minority borrowers who were burdened with costly and ultimately unpayable mortgages? This paper develops a mesoanalysis to answer the first of these questions. This analysis traces the coevolution of banking strategies and client communities, shaped by and reinforcing patterns of racial/ethnic inequality. The second question is answered by showing how unequal power relations impacted patterns of subprime lending. Consequences for gender inequality in credit markets are also briefly discussed."

UNCTAD experts discussed the main findings and recommendations of a recently completed Investment Policy Review (IPR) of the country. Government officials, business and civil society representatives, and officials from the Djibouti offices of the United Nations Development Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization attended.\nUNCTAD carries out IPRs at the request of developing countries. The Djibouti review provides a comprehensive assessment of the country's investment-related policies, laws, and overall institutional \"context\" related to investment. It also assesses the character of past foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to Djibouti and analyses their impact in terms of economic and social development. Based on Djibouti's development objectives, the IPR provides a strategy for attracting greater investment.\nConsidering the country's unique geostrategic location, the report advocates greater \"customization\" of investment promotion for priority sectors such as transport, logistics, fishing and tourism. It also urges an optimization of institutional resources, notably by strengthening the national investment promotion agency.\nIn addition, the IPR calls for a streamlining of the institutional procedures for investment promotion in Djibouti. It recommends in particular that a high-level platform be set up for discussion between the public and private sectors on investment matters.\nIlyas Moussa Dawaleh, Djibouti's Minister of Economy and Finance, opening the workshop, thanked UNCTAD for the report, whose analysis and recommendations will contribute to designing solutions for reducing unemployment in Djibouti. He underscored the importance of adopting a modern investment code, along with other efforts to create a climate that will allow the business sector in Djibouti to flourish.\nThe presentation of the IPR was followed by an extended discussion. Participants welcomed proposed measures for improving investment treatment and protection and expressed support for specific proposals to make taxation friendlier for small and medium-sized enterprises. Other topics discussed included land legislation, environmental regulation, and governance issues related to investment.\nIn closing the meeting, Mahdi Darar, Director-General of Djibouti's National Investment Promotion Agency, expressed gratitude to UNCTAD for what he called \"a very useful exercise which will contribute to improving the country's investment promotion capacity.\"\nThe IPR is the first step of a programme of technical assistance that is intended to help the country more effectively use foreign direct investment to achieve its development goals. UNCTAD will continue providing support to the Government of Djibouti as it implements the recommendations in the report."

        "webpage": "Q:\n\nWhat is the best way to stop phishing for online banking?\n\nPhishing is a very serious problem that we face. However, banks are the biggest targets.  What methods can a bank use to protect its self from phishing attacks? What methods should someone use to protect themselves.   Why does it stop attacks? \n\nA:\n\nPhishing usually works by directing the consumer to a scraped version of the website.  One method that's starting to be more common is a dynamic website, where after entry of username and before entry of password, the bank site reveals some image or phrase chosen by the consumer, which I will call the counter-password.  In essence, not only must the consumer present a valid password, so does the bank.  Mutual authentication.\nThe phishing site cannot display the correct counter-passwordwithout querying the bank, and this gives the bank an opportunity to detect, confound, and prosecute the proxy.\nThis can be enhanced with use of an out-of-band communication channel.  If the IP address making the request (which would be the proxy, possibly via onion routing) isn't one the consumer has logged in from before, send the consumer an SMS with a one-time code they must additionally use before the counter-password is revealed and login enabled.\nOther methods are for the browser to cache the correct server certificate and tell the consumer when they visit a site without a cached certificate, thus warning the consumer that this isn't the familiar site they've used before.\n\nA:\n\nIMO, the best thing that a bank can do is to educate it's users on when and how they will communicate with them. Many users have no idea about what phishing is and so showing them examples and raising their awareness about fraud will do more than any technical solution (though the technical side should be pursued just as aggressively). A user aware that phishing can occur will be far less likely to fall prey to it.\n\nA:\n\nThe best way to prevent phishing attacks should rely on technical means that don't require the user to understand the problem. The target audience will always be large enough to find someone who gets fooled.\nA good way to prevent from attacks is to use an authentication mechanism that doesn't rely on a simple pass phrase or transaction authentication number (TAN) that an attacker can steal. \nExisting methods e.g. use dynamic TANs (Indexed TAN or iTAN), or a TAN submitted on a separate channel via SMS (mobile TAN or mTAN), or - most secure and also preventing from real-time man-in-the-middle attacks - require the user to sign each transaction, e.g. using DigiPass or a smartcard.\nThe reason that this is not widely implemented is probably that it is still more cost-effective for banks to pay for the damage from phishing attacks than investing in security."

Sharpe\n[An updated version of this biography can be found at William F. Sharpe in the 2nd edition.]\nIn 1990 U.S. economists William F. Sharpe, Harry Markowitz, and Merton H. Miller shared the Nobel Prize for their contributions to financial economics. Their early contributions established financial economics as a separate field of study. In the sixties Sharpe, taking off from Markowitz's portfolio theory, developed the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). One implication of this model was that a single mix of risky assets fits in every investor's portfolio. Those who want a high return hold a portfolio heavily weighted with the risky asset; those who want a low return hold a portfolio heavily weighted with a riskless asset, such as an insured bank deposit. A measure of the portfolio risk that cannot be diversified away by mixing stocks is \"beta.\" A portfolio with a beta of 1.5, for example, is likely to rise by 15 percent if the stock market rises by 10 percent and is likely to fall by 15 percent if the market falls by 10 percent.\nOne implication of Sharpe's work is that the expected return on a portfolio in excess of a riskless return should be beta times the excess return of the market. Thus, a portfolio with a beta of 2 should have an excess return that is twice as high as the market as a whole. If the market's expected return is 8 percent and the riskless return is 5 percent, the market's expected excess return is 3 percent (8 minus 5) and the portfolio's expected excess return is therefore 6 percent (twice the market's expected excess return of 3 percent). The portfolio's expected total return would then be 11 percent (6 plus the riskless return of 5).\nSharpe was a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California at Los Angeles and an employee of the Rand Corporation when he first met Markowitz, who was also employed at Rand. Sharpe chose Markowitz as his dissertation adviser, even though Markowitz was not on the faculty at UCLA. Sharpe taught first at the University of Washington in Seattle and then at the University of California at Irvine. In 1971 he became a professor of finance at Stanford University. In 1986 Sharpe founded William F. Sharpe Associates, a firm that consulted to foundations, endowments, and pension plans.

Since late June, when the first Hmong refugees from the Wat Tham Krabok camp in Thailand arrived in Minnesota, Executive Director William Yang and his staff have worked 12-hour days in and out of the Partnership's cluttered offices above a U.S. Bank branch on St. Paul's East Side. The organization was selected by the Minnesota Council of Churches, one of seven resettlement agencies active in Minnesota, to do most of the spade work involved in settling an anticipated 5,000 Hmong in the metro area over the next year. That means matching the refugees with \"anchor families\" - relatives who can house, clothe and feed them; signing them up for English-language training and health screenings (medical care was nonexistent at the Wat camp); and helping them find and hold onto jobs. The Partnership receives $320 from the U.S. State Department for each refugee it handles, but that won't be nearly enough to cover years of services that the refugees - most of them young, destitute and illiterate - will need to become self-sufficient.\n\"We are dealing with a people who have low skills, who have been ignored by the Thai government and isolated for many years,\" said Yang, himself a Hmong refugee who came to Minnesota in 1980 after spending his childhood in the jungles of Laos and a Thai refugee camp.\nThe arrival of the Hmong in the Twin Cities is just the latest wave in a tide of immigration that has swept over the Ninth District in the past 15 years. More than half of the region's 320,000 foreign-born residents arrived in the 1990s. Three years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the foreign influx appears to be as strong as ever, with newcomers continuing to arrive from Southeast Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa. Drawn mostly by low-paying jobs in manufacturing, health care, retail and basic services, they've put down roots in cities such as St. Paul and Fargo, and small towns like Pelican Rapids, Minn., and Barron, Wis., changing the face of communities that haven't experienced significant immigration for generations. As the number of immigrants in the district grows, their presence becomes increasingly controversial. Across the country and in the district, attitudes toward immigrants have soured since the economic downturn and the 9/11 attacks, committed by Muslim visa holders. The knock against immigrants is that they compete for local jobs, not only stealing work from native-born residents but depressing wages to boot, and leeching taxpayers further through their heavy use of social services such as schools, cash assistance, medical care and housing subsidies. Some Americans, including respected academics, espouse that view, although they may not express it so baldly. Others maintain that immigrants revitalize neighborhoods and cities, planting the seeds for future economic growth with their strong backs, new ideas and entrepreneurial energy. Perennial arguments for and against continued immigration were given fresh legs earlier this year by President George Bush's proposal to grant temporary legal status to undocumented immigrant workers, and counterlegislation introduced by Democrats that would allow illegal aliens to apply for permanent residency.\nThis fedgazette explores several aspects of a politically sensitive issue: where recent immigrants have settled in the district, and why; their impact on local labor markets, including the wages and employment of native-born workers; and the burdens they impose on taxpayers whose ancestors came to this country before them.

While the U.S. financial sector has mostly delevered and the U.S. economy is \"on a sounder footing than I expected,\" he argued in a response to a question from Commonwealth chief investment officer and fellow CFA Brad McMillan that \"Europe never fixed its banks.\" That Achilles heel can be pricked if depositors start withdrawing from Greek, Italian and Spanish banks, he said.\nHowever, Koesterich suggested that there were areas of Europe that provide opportunities for investors, notably in Norway and Sweden. And while valuations among U.S. companies have increased to the point that many are trading at a premium to their book value, especially smaller-cap stocks, the \"valuation cushion\" might be stronger internationally, especially in smaller developed countries like Singapore and Switzerland.\nReturning to domestic matters, in answer to an advisor's query on whether the markets are currently experiencing a \"great rotation\" back into equities, Koesterich was dubious. \"It's not happening,\" he said, arguing that fund flows into equities are not coming from bonds, but rather that investors are moving out of cash accounts back into equities, using proceeds from sales of appreciated equities last year.\nAs for U.S. economic growth, Koesterich said that while debt as a percentage of GDP has stabilized, \"total nonfinancial U.S. debt\" stands at 251% of GDP. \"When debt gets this high,\" Koesterich warned, \"it has an effect on growth.\"\nMcMillan began the session, which took place during the 10th annual Chairman's Retreat for top-producing Commonwealth Financial reps, by asking if Washington was still the \"financial capital of the world.\"\nKoesterich's response: \"We've spent too much time worrying about Washington,\" and that at least in the short term, \"we've dodged most of the issues\" around government debt. Longer term, he said that \"the U.S. can go on like this for another four to five years,\" spurred by quantitative easing and slow though stolid economic growth, and that the deficit \"won't start looking bad until 2017.\" By then, he warned, the increasing numbers of retiring baby boomers may contribute to a \"crowding-out factor,\" when the government's need for financing may bump up against consumers' borrowing needs.\nRuss Koesterich\nBrad McMillan"

        "webpage": "external_content Foes Of Tax Cuts, Fans Of Big Gov't\nBY James C. Miller III\nby James C. Miller III on 3/22/01. Amid the controversy over House action on President Bush's tax cut, it's easy to miss the bigger battle. Whether Bush is moving too fast or too slowly, whether government should address revenue before outlays or vice versa, whether there should be a \"trigger\" on the tax cut - these are all tactics in the larger battle over the size and scope of the federal government. Take the argument that the president has \"rushed through\" the tax cut. Any new administration can get more done in the first day than in the next week, and more in that week than in the next month. Also, it is easier to defeat a bill than to get one passed into law. So fail to act quickly, and your tax cut is toast. Not surprisingly, those making the charge that the House acted precipitously and ignored \"democratic processes\" are found on the side of bigger government. Or take the debate over deciding revenue before outlays. Should Congress first decide how much of the taxpayers' money it can \"afford\" to spend and then budget accordingly? Or should it decide how much to spend and then adjust tax revenue? The second approach leads to greater revenue and spending than the first. So is it any wonder that those whose vision is an ever-larger government are among the most vocal critics of addressing revenue first? Finally, take the proposal to incorporate a \"trigger\" that would suspend the tax cut if the surplus fell below forecast. Such triggers do work. In the 1980s we had one called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH). In the first year of its operation, the growth in the federal deficit was reversed and came down a record $ 71 billion. Government spending, adjusted for inflation, actually fell for the first time in nearly two decades. In fact, GRH worked so well that it came under intense fire from members of Congress who simply could not live within its restraints. The GRH trigger was on the spending side. If the deficit failed to be eliminated according to schedule, a \"mechanical robot\" would cut spending across the board. Under the trigger being promoted today, if the surplus weren't maintained, tax rates would go up. But if the concern is really about the surplus, a spending trigger would suffice just as well. In fact, a spending trigger would work better. The tax cut is designed to put the economy back on its expansionary course by lowering marginal tax rates and giving investors more incentives to expand production. A tax trigger would add uncertainty and dampen the response the tax cut is meant to create. Naturally, proponents of the tax trigger tend to be aligned with larger government. What is surprising is that the proponents of the tax cut don't counter with a trigger of their own - one that would cut spending and thus focus the debate on the real issue, the size and scope of government.

It is also forecast to create up to 11,923 jobs, which would see employment rise by between 0.15 and 0.16 percent.According to the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER), which collaborated with the ministry in evaluating the pact, the expected macroeconomic improvements would manifest themselves 10 years after the deal is implemented.\"The service trade agreement is supposed to 'open a door' for the nation's economy and help Taiwanese enterprises gain competitiveness in global markets as more trade agreements are signed in different regional trading blocs,\" Minister of Economic Affairs Chang Chia-juch (\u5f35\u5bb6\u795d) told a press conference.Chang said the government's efforts to liberalize domestic markets are crucial to Taiwan's chances of joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.He added that signing the trade pact would do more good than harm to the economy because it could push local enterprises to upgrade their service quality.However, since the evaluation was based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Model, a research tool widely used by academic and economic researchers for quantitative analyses, they exclude the agreement's potential qualitative impacts on the country's economic security, talent mobility and society, CIER said.National Taiwan University economics professor Kenneth Lin (\u6797\u5411\u6137) told the Taipei Times by telephone that the CIER should have not used the GTAP Model for the evaluation because \"services by nature are non-tradable goods and their quality matters more to consumers than prices.\"\"The cross-strait service agreement's terms do not offer Taiwan and China the same treatment, be it in terms of restriction to the flow of funds or professionals in specific sectors or the number of sectors to be fully opened,\" Lin said.\"The majority of the public welcome the Agreement between New Zealand and the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu on Economic Cooperation [ANZTEC] because they know the adverse impact it could have on the nation's economy are limited due to the great difference between the services offered by New Zealand enterprises and Taiwanese enterprises,\" he added.The idea that the more free-trade agreements a country signs, the better its economy will become is fundamentally wrong, Lin said.He said that local companies would face stiff challenges from their Chinese counterparts because both offer services in the same language.Given China's troublesome regulations for issuing work permits to foreign Internet services providers  -  such as requiring that the company not disagree with Beijing's policies  -  Taiwanese e-commerce firms might encounter obstacles when investing in China, Lin said.The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said the report had been compiled belatedly, since the pact was signed on June 21, and appeared to have been hastily conducted, reflecting that the agreement was signed without first gaining a proper understanding of Chinese or local sectors.The report was not credible for three reasons, DPP Department of China Affairs director Honigmann Hung (\u6d2a\u8ca1\u9686) said in a press release yesterday evening.First, the claim that no sector would be negatively impacted was unbelievable, as it was done without evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each sector, he said.The report also failed to present the pact's pros and cons to the public, as representatives from various service sectors asked the government to do, Hung said, adding that it also ignored non-economic impacts, Hung said.\"It's irresponsible for the government to ignore Beijing's attempt to absorb Taiwan's economy with its state capital,\" he said.Additional reporting by Chris Wang"

Consumer advocates, however, questioned why it took so long and why prosecutors didn't bring a criminal case.\nJamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase\nMCT/Seattle Times\nBy Kevin G. Hall and Lindsay Wise - McClatchy Newspapers\nSpeaking at a news conference at Department of Justice headquarters, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman offered no apologies for going after JPMorgan Chase for sins committed by investment bank Bear Stearns, which it bought with government help in March 2008. Bear Stearns was a top bundler of mortgages into complex bonds that turned out to be junk, sparking the deep financial crisis in 2008. Schneiderman's civil suit, which seeks unspecified financial damages on behalf of residents of the state of New York, alleges widespread deception and misconduct in the packaging, selling and monitoring of the complex financial instruments.\nJPMorgan Chase officials declined to comment on the suit.\nAt issue are the actions of EMC Mortgage, the Texas-based mortgage unit of Bear Stearns in the run-up to the crisis. The 31-page civil complaint alleges that the bank and EMC failed to properly evaluate the mortgages packaged into bonds for sale to investors, failed to fix problems in the due diligence process and secured monetary repayment for the bank instead of investors when mortgages went bust.\nOfficials from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Justice Department lined up on the podium for the announcement. Together they make up the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, federal and state officials who are probing the mortgage finance component of the nation's deep financial crisis.\nNo criminal charges were announced, not against former Bear Stearns executives such as former CEO Alan Schwartz and former Chairman Jimmy Cayne, nor against executives who worked at EMC.\n\"The Justice Department has just been embarrassingly passive in terms of criminal prosecution,\" said Michael Greenberger, a University of Maryland law professor, former commodities regulator and former top DOJ adviser. \"Is this the first shoe to drop? Is it a one-off, or does it really mean that the mortgage-fraud task force is at work and there will be other civil actions and criminal actions to follow?\"\nActing Associate Attorney General Tony West deflected questions of political timing, with the announcement coming a month before the presidential election, noting that, \"We follow the facts and the law, wherever they may lead.\"\nConsumer groups urged more. \"We're all frustrated,\" said Ira Rheingold, the executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. \"It's a shame more cases haven't been brought. It's a shame that the heads of the banks got their golden parachutes. And, unfortunately, I think the saddest part about the whole thing is that I have no sense that there's any real remorse out of these institutions. Immediately they're back to business as usual.''\nThe consumer groups said that meant settling civil lawsuits was seen as a business cost.\n\"You can make a lot of money doing corporate crime and unfortunately the risks are very low, as seen by how few people have gone to jail and how little money has been returned to people harmed in the fiscal crisis,\" said Ed Mierzwinski, the consumer program director for advocacy group U.S. PIRG. \"These corporations so far are paying an infinitesimal amount of money compared to the havoc they wreaked on families, homes and the economy.\"\nThe government action came against a bank that the government had asked to take over Bear Stearns for the good of the country.\nThe Bush administration sought the sale to thwart a financial meltdown like the one that ensued in September 2008 when investment bank Lehman Brothers couldn't find a suitor. Then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson leaned on JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to purchase Bear Stearns at a fire-sale price during a turbulent weekend in March 2008.\n\"I called Jamie Dimon at 4:30 p.m. and told him we needed to get the deal done by the end of the weekend,\" Paulson later wrote. \"Self-assured, charismatic and quick-witted, Jamie had the ability to walk the line between being a tough businessman and knowing when to rein in his competitive instincts for the good of the financial system.\"\nLater in his memoir, Paulson noted that JPMorgan Chase \"was particularly concerned with the firm's mortgage portfolio\" and the bank \"didn't want any of Bear's mortgage portfolio,\" then valued at around $35 billion.\nSchneiderman wasn't bothered by going after the bank that had been asked to save the financial system, noting that JPMorgan Chase had acquired both assets and liabilities in the deal.\nAsked by McClatchy whether he'd personally discussed the civil complaint with Dimon, one of the only financial actors to come out of the crisis with his reputation untarnished, Schneiderman said, \"We have not spoken recently.\""

But hidden behind the fa\u00e7ade of laundry detergent and bean-less chili is the untold story of a regional stock exchange that traded such companies as Delta Air Lines and American Electric Power Co. An exchange that gave birth to the national stock market system that allows 25 million transactions and 5 billion corporate shares to be traded daily. A story of new technology that now powers exchanges all over the world. A system that brought order to the chaos of seven independently operated national exchanges and threatened the dominance of the New York Stock Exchange.\nFor nearly two centuries the securities markets had operated on an outdated manual system grounded in a fixed-rate commission structure that benefited large dealer-brokers and the exchanges where they were members, with little or no regard for healthy competition. By 1971, the SEC actively studied the securities market to identify the problems posed by this protected business environment.\nIn the SEC's (Security and Exchange Commission) Institutional Study Report in 1971, the Commission found that fixed commission rates impacted the securities market by limiting its usefulness to investors. Without question, the broker - rather than the investor - benefited from fixed commission transactions. The New York Stock Exchange and its brokerage members and securities specialists were eating up profits at the expense of the investing public customers. These findings led Congress to pass the Securities Act Amendments in 1975, ordering the development of a national market system using modern telecommunication and computerization tools and the un-fixing of commission rates; i.e., deregulation of the U.S. securities markets.\nAnti-competitive practices existed in part because of the lack of communication and connectivity between the seven independent national exchanges then in existence in the United States: the Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles, (collectively the Pacific), New York and American Stock Exchanges. Lack of communication often led to large price disparities between the stock exchanges quoting the same stock. The NYSE was particularly fond of the fixed-rate commission practice, an"

Mortensen\nPensions International, issue 83, 2006, p.6-9\nIn the Spring of 2006 the European Commission released a new set of projections of the budgetary costs of population ageing. In addition to a revision of the projections last made in 2001, new projections have been prepared for the ten new member states, allowing a complete assessment of the outlook for public spending on pensions, health and long term care for older people for all 25 member countries. The projections now include estimates of the potential savings on public spending on education (due to fewer children and young people) and unemployment benefit (due to the assumption of higher employment rates in all cohorts).\nPolicies to encourage older people to remain in the workforce\nA.H. Munnell and R. Lluberas\nIf older people in developed countries continue to retire in their early sixties, many will not have accumulated enough resources to ensure a secure retirement. In the light of the dramatic increase in life expectancy, continued employment in later life appears to be a promising option for ensuring financial security in old age. This demographic shift may impact adversely on employers as well. They will no longer be able to rely on a steady supply of younger workers. Expanding the use of women and immigrants may not be enough to fill all the vacant jobs. Increased employment of older workers may thus be in the interests of both workers and employers.\nShifting the pension mix: consequences for Dutch and Danish women\nP. Frericks, R. Maier and W. de Graaf\nSocial Policy and Administration, vol.40, 2006, p.475-492\nAll European countries aim to reform their pension systems so that entitlements are built up through basic state, occupational and private schemes. Denmark and the Netherlands already have a well-developed basic state pension based on residency combined with occupational and private schemes. This article demonstrates how the pension system in both countries disadvantages women, especially mothers, who have taken time out of paid work to fulfil caring responsibilities and so have not been able to build up substantial occupational pension entitlements.\nWomen's welfare and social security privatization in Mexico\nM. Dion\nSocial Politics, vol.13, 2006, p.400-426\nIn 1995 Mexico privatised its state retirement pension system, including a shift from a defined benefit to a defined contribution model based on privately administered individual accounts. This article uses feminist criteria to evaluate the gender impact of the reforms, and concludes that the Mexican pension privatisation will have a negative effect on women's welfare in old age.\nSearch Welfare Reform on the Web\nDisclaimer | Privacy | Copyright \ufffd The\nBritish Library Board Copyright \ufffd The British Library Board"

        "webpage": "Business Valuation: by Isaac M. O'Bannon On Nov 1, 2007\nFrom the Nov. 2007 Issue\nOver the past several years, especially since the advent of DIY tax prep and bookkeeping systems, many accounting professionals have sought new services to offer their clients, both as a means of adding a new revenue stream, as well as to help strengthen their client relationships.\nFor some firms, this has meant adding full payroll service bureau capabilities, like the firm of Greene & McCowan CPAs in London, Kentucky. According to partner Ryan McCowan, CPA.CITP, the practice processes more than 60 payroll runs, totaling more than 150,000 paychecks per year. To read more on his practice, see the Productivity in Practice feature in this issue.\nStill other firms have added or expanded their capabilities in the areas of tax and business planning, financial statement analysis, financial advising, and brokerage and mortgage services. But many professionals have turned to business valuation. While this service has been offered by a few professional accountants for years, it was often too labor intensive and required a high degree of specialty. But technology has recently caught up, automating many tasks and making the processes involved much more efficient and, therefore, more profitable.\nAnd the future of the service looks good: The demand for business valuation experts has been increasing. Professionals with a Certified Valuation Analyst (CVA) credential from the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts (NACVA) are frequently called on to provide their financial expertise during divorces, sales of partnerships, shareholder disputes and bankruptcies. They also often provide support for other litigation, as well as in estate planning and gift tax compliance. In many of these cases, especially in divorce cases, the courts and attorneys representing the parties are not often prepared for valuation matters, which often include family-run businesses and partnerships. So valuation professionals provide neutral expert testimony, either on behalf of one of the clients, or even on behalf of the court in some bankruptcy matters. Increasingly, both parties in divorces are jointly hiring a valuation professional to assess the value of a business. Knowing the real market value of an entity is also important when preparing for its sale and when seeking financing.\nIn addition to their professional expertise, these valuation experts also often rely on programs built specifically to determine the value of a business entity. The major systems on the market include DealSense Plus+ and Corporate Valuation Professional from MoneySoft (), Express Business Valuation from ValuSource (), and NACVA's () line of software, which includes Business Valuation Manager Pro, Express Business Valuation, and the Business Valuation Report Writer, along with a collection of valuation databases.\n\"A valuation program is vital to being able to offer these services,\" said Jay Dunbar, CPA, CVA, partner in the accounting services firm of Dunbar, Broaddus, Gibson, LLP, in El Paso, Texas (). His practice uses the NACVA program and, as the firm's expert in this field, he spends as much as 60 percent of his time on valuation engagements. Of course, the firm also provides more traditional services like individual and corporate taxation, partnerships, financials preparation and consulting. But its valuation services account for as much as 10 percent of the firm's gross revenues. \"Before software automated many of the valuation processes, there were only a few people who could offer the service because they had developed their own systems to manage the complex formulas and calculations,\" he said. \"But I'm an accountant, not a programmer. I'm not even really good with Excel and Word. I'm more of a techno klutz than a techno geek, so trying to learn a new system at this stage in my career is not something that I really want to do.\n\"But the NACVA program and the report writer are laid out in a way that makes it easy for me to use, and it helps organize all of the tasks and provides me with data that is useful to me and that I can present in court.\" Since valuations can be challenged, Dunbar says it's important to have a professionally designed program whose reputation is known as credible. This is because the assessments he provides in court are challengeable, and he has to be able to justify the calculations. Most of the judges and lawyers know the major systems on the market, though, and have confidence in their calculations, as opposed to practitioners who do everything based on homemade spreadsheets. According to Dunbar, \"The program really is pretty much unassailable.\" Continue Reading\nBusiness Valuation: Small Business\nAudit and Risk Professionals Say Biggest Challenge is Communicating with Executives Tax & Compliance\nCongress Creates New Tax-Favored Savings Accounts for Disabled Accounting & Audit\n3 Tips for More Accurate Business Valuation Accounting & Audit\nFinancial Group Wants More Limits on Corporate Inversions Payroll\nGadgets for All!

        "webpage": "Progress, less pain for lower earners Filed under\nToday, the average after-tax income of a member of the top 1 percent of earners is $1.12 million. The average after-tax income of someone in the bottom 20 percent is $13,300. That means the average person at the top takes home 84 times as much as the average person in the bottom tier.Now, consider what it would be like if none of President Barack Obama's tax policy changes had happened: not the upper-income tax hikes negotiated at the beginning of last year, not the upper-income tax increases imposed by the Affordable Care Act, not the low-income tax credits enacted in the 2009 stimulus and later renewed.In this alternative universe, the average member of the top 1 percent would take home $1.2 million, or 6.5 percent more in income, according to a new analysis. The average member of the bottom 20 percent would bring home $13,100, or 1.2 percent less in income. As a result, the average member of the 1 percent would take home 91 times what the average person in the bottom would bring home.If you've wondered whether Obama has made any headway at reducing income inequality, here's evidence that he has. Based on tax policy alone, he has slightly increased the income of the poor and reduced the income of the rich. That's according to a new, exclusive analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, conducted at the request of The Washington Post, that compared today's income distribution with what it would look like if President George W. Bush's tax policies were still in place.But looking just at tax policy is incomplete. In some ways, it overstates the reduction in inequality. In others, it understates it.First, the overstatement. There's no question that the tax code does more today than it used to do to reduce inequality. But that is after-tax inequality. To measure overall inequality, you have to think about both pretax and after-tax inequality. If the economy is dramatically boosting the incomes of the rich and leaving the incomes of the poor stagnant, after-tax inequality will widen, unless the tax code becomes more progressive.From 2004 to 2006, according to analysis of Tax Policy Center data, both pre- and post-tax inequality increased. It then began to level off as the economy started to weaken, and it fell significantly when the economy entered recession. Inequality started widening again after the shock of the financial crisis faded, and the economy began to recover.Several factors explain this trend. For starters, the collapse in the financial markets wiped out a lot of income for the top 1 percent, people who own large amounts of financial assets. The poor did not suffer these losses, and they also received income support in the form of refundable tax credits. In fact, in 2009, the bottom 20 percent received more in tax refunds than they paid in taxes. That explains why that year, the ratio of average after-tax income taken home by top earners to bottom earners fell to 79, a recent low.After the financial crisis ended, inequality picked up as many of the benefits of the recovery accrued to the wealthy.This changes in 2013, when the upper-income tax hikes, and the Affordable Care Act taxes took effect. The ratio of the top 1 percent's average after-tax income to the bottom 20 percent's fell from 99 in 2012 to 84 in 2013. This is still above the ratio in 2009, meaning that after-tax inequality was higher.Now, the understatement. Starting this year, and for the next several years, the government will do more to shrink inequality as a result of Obama policies. That's because this year, Americans earning up to 400 percent of the poverty line will start receiving subsidies to pay for health insurance. In addition, Americans earning up to 133 percent of the poverty line will be eligible for expanded Medicaid. The total value of the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion will be worth about $140 billion in 2016, as the Affordable Care Act ramps up.Given that the expansion of low-income tax credits under Obama provided a noticeable boost to the poor at a cost of $25 billion a year, the Affordable Care Act subsidies and Medicaid expansion will provide another boost, well over $1,000 a year per household. As a result, inequality will shrink further.Zachary A. Goldfarb,The Washington Post View Comments"

        "webpage": "P.O. Box 930 Everett, WA 98206 Consumer confidence falls in March\nSHARE: Associated Press Published: Tuesday, March 26, 2013, 1:25 p.m. advertisement | your ad here\nWASHINGTON -- Americans are less confident in the economy than they were last month as massive government spending cuts have stoked economic uncertainty.It's just the latest swing in the way Americans feel about the economy. Their views have fluctuated between optimism and angst over the months as they've weighed an advancing stock market and housing recovery against new economic challenges. \"From my standpoint, we're still in a stalled recovery,\" says Skip Tamke, a central New Jersey project manager for a computer storage company who lost a job last May that paid twice what he's earning now.The Conference Board, a New York-based private research group, said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index fell in March to 59.7 from a revised reading of 68 in February and the 68.7 that analysts polled by research firm FactSet expected. Confidence is still far off from the 90 reading that indicates a healthy economy.The index is closely watched by economists because it makes a monthly gauge of how Americans are feeling about their jobs, incomes and other bread-and-butter issues. That's important because consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic activity.Anxiety about $85 billion in across-the-board government spending cuts that took effect March 1 caused the decline in the index, the group said. The spending reductions, which were triggered after Congress and the White House failed to resolve a budget impasse, have \"created uncertainty regarding the economic outlook,\" Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's director of economic indicators, said in a statementCongress and the Obama administration reached a deal on Jan. 1 to prevent income taxes from rising on most Americans. But they allowed a temporary cut in Social Security taxes to expire. For a worker earning $50,000 a year, take-home pay will shrink by about $1,000.That has a more direct impact on most Americans than the government spending reductions, noted Scott Brown, chief economist at investment firm Raymond James. The March drop in the confidence index \"likely reflects the impact of higher gasoline prices as well as the higher payroll tax,\" Brown said. Although the payroll tax increase kicked in three months ago, its effect may just now be sinking in for some people, he says. The Conference Board's survey was conducted from March 1 through March 14. The sharp decline in the March index was caused mainly by a drop in expectations for the economy, though consumers also were more pessimistic regarding current economic conditions, the group said. The number of people anticipating more jobs in the months ahead fell to 12.3 percent from 16.1 percent, while those expecting their incomes to increase slipped to 13.7 percent from 15.8 percent.Consumers also are again pessimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy, the group said. The proportion of people expecting business conditions to improve over the next six months fell to 14.4 percent from 18 percent a month earlier, while those expecting conditions to worsen rose to 18.3 percent from 16.6 percent.Chris Christopher, director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight, said he expects consumer confidence to recover as the \"shock value\" of the mandated spending cuts wanes. However, \"smaller paychecks, depressed consumer mood, and rising (gasoline) prices are not very favorable for elevated levels of discretionary spending,\" Christopher wrote in a research note.The decline in consumer confidence comes as Americans are seeing some signs of an improving economy.Stock prices have roughly doubled since June 2009. And the job market, while still tough, is rebounding. Employers added 236,000 jobs in February, driving the unemployment rate down to 7.7 percent, its lowest level in more than four years. The gains signaled that companies are confident enough in the economy to intensify hiring even in the face of tax increases and government spending cuts. Americans spent more at retailers in February despite the smaller paychecks, according to a Commerce Department report issued on March 13. Much of the increase in retail sales compared with January reflected higher gasoline prices. But even excluding the volatile categories of gas, autos and building supply stores, so-called core retail sales rose strongly. The healthier-than-expected numbers prompted some experts to revise their estimates of U.S. economic growth for the January-March quarter. And the Conference Board's measure of the U.S. economy's health over the next six months, reported on Thursday, increased in February from January. But that says little about the current financial reality for Americans like Tamke, the central New Jersey resident. He says he was out of work for over eight months before he found his current position.\"I know I'm not pumping anything into the economy,\" he says. \"I am barely able to pay my bills.\"\nBrexit vote slams world, U.S. financial markets 3:08 p.m. Yellen\ufffds Fed to play long game dealing with Brexit fallout"

Counting Costs Slows Dodd-Frank Rule-making at near-halt as business lobbyists wield cudgel of cost-benefit analysis.\nBy Steven Sloan, Bloomberg May 7, 2012\nBusiness lobbyists and Republican lawmakers who failed to stop the Dodd-Frank Act from becoming law have managed to put the brakes on many of its provisions a second way: cost-benefit analysis.\nA series of legal challenges from business groups against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ended in a federal court ruling last year that the agency didn't adequately analyze the cost of a new rule. In the months since, the agency's rule-making has ground to a near-halt, with just 24 SEC economists working full-time to provide cost-benefit analyses for dozens of proposed policies, including 28 unfinished Dodd-Frank rules.\nNow lawmakers are trying to write the cost-benefit strategy into law. The goal, said Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican, is to save taxpayers money while also weakening the ability of regulators to implement Dodd-Frank.\n\"That may very well be the effect,\" said Garrett, who is the chairman of the House Financial Services subcommittee with oversight of the SEC. \"But if you stood next to me a proponent of Dodd-Frank, they should be willing, ready and able to support legislation that would make sure you're not wasting money in the implementation of Dodd-Frank.\"\nThe strategy has spread to target other federal agencies as well. In December, two groups representing Wall Street firms filed suit against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, arguing that a rule to limit speculation used a flawed cost- benefit analysis. Last month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Investment Company Institute filed a similar lawsuit challenging a CFTC rule affecting mutual funds.\nRoel Campos, a former SEC commissioner, said the court decision combined with pressure from Capitol Hill could prevent the SEC and other agencies from moving forward with a wide variety of rules, not just those required by Dodd-Frank.\n\"The business community has been given a new powerful tool to use against any rulemakings they dislike,\" said Campos, who is now a partner at the Locke Lord LLP law firm in Washington. \"The standard will prevent the agency from being able to deal with anything that's controversial.\"\nSEC rules still waiting to be finalized include a regulation that would require companies to disclose whether they use material that was mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and another proposal that would govern executive compensation. A recently enacted law that eases securities regulation for closely held firms and newly public companies will also add to the SEC's rule-writing responsibilities.\nAs the SEC's to-do list gets longer, congressional pressure on the agency is intensifying. Since April 17, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro has spent more than five hours before two House committees answering at least 50 questions about how the agency calculates the cost of rules it proposes.\nSenator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, introduced legislation April 26 that would require the SEC to study the cost of its proposals. The bill is similar to one that Garrett is shepherding through the House.\n\"This shouldn't be remarkable,\" said Eugene Scalia, a lawyer at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP in Washington. \"It should be normal for federal agencies to look at how costly their rules are before imposing them.\"\nScalia, son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, helped lay the foundation that would ultimately spur the debate in Congress. He won a case at the U.S. Court of Appeals in July that overturned an SEC rule that would have expanded shareholder rights. In the decision, U.S. Circuit Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote that the SEC \"inconsistently and opportunistically framed the costs and benefits\" of the shareholder proposal.\nRepresentative Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee, told Schapiro during an April 17"

        "webpage": "Why The Fed Decided Not To Change Course By Marilyn Geewax\nOct 30, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Citing continued signs of weakness, the Federal Reserve said it will keep aiming for low interest rates.\nMark Wilson\nOriginally published on October 30, 2013 3:27 pm Look around. Do you see much inflation? Gas prices are down more than 7 percent from last year. Grocery costs haven't budged lately. And  -  just in time for Halloween  -  the price of candy is down 2.3 percent from last year, according to the government's consumer price index released Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, Federal Reserve policymakers concluded that amid tame inflation and slow growth, they see no need to change direction in their approach to helping the economy. They will continue their program of buying bonds to help put downward pressure on the cost of borrowing, which is intended to help boost the battered housing market. The policymakers said the housing recovery \"slowed somewhat in recent months\" and \"the unemployment rate remains elevated.\" They \"decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases\" of bonds, the Fed said in its statement. The Fed's bond-buying efforts helped tamp down mortgage rates to historic lows. While everyone agrees that effort has made mortgage refinancing and homebuying easier, it also has worried many economists who fear that such prolonged intervention in markets will lead to trouble down the road. Trouble is spelled i-n-f-l-a-t-i-o-n. Fed officials themselves have stated they will have to \"taper down\" bond purchases eventually to allow rates to return to higher, more normal levels. But as of the end of Wednesday's meeting, that time hasn't come. The central bank policymakers are worried that without their intervention, lending would get tighter and that would slow the economy. So what do the latest data tell us about the current state of the economy? Because of the federal government shutdown earlier this month, many key reports have been canceled or delayed, so economists have been working with fewer numbers than usual. But still, they have enough information from industry and government sources to be able to estimate what is happening. Here are some of the things we know: Jobs are growing, but at a disappointing rate. On Wednesday, payroll processing firm ADP said private sector employment rose by 130,000 in October, lower than September's gain of 145,000. \"Hiring slowed in October with the government shutdown and debt limit debate, but did not stall,\" PNC Financial Services Group chief economist Stuart Hoffman said in his assessment. The consumer price index shows food prices are flat, and inflation generally is tame. \"Soggy demand, weak energy prices, reversal of post-drought price gains in food, and relatively high unemployment rates are all slowly cooling price pressures,\" IHS Global Insight economist Chris Christopher wrote in his analysis. Gasoline in particular has taken a dive, at least compared with last year. Gasbuddy.com says the average gallon of regular gas costs $3.29. At this time last year, it was $3.55. Middle-market companies  -  businesses with annual sales between $10 million and $1 billion  -  saw revenues grow by 5.5 percent over the past year, but nearly half say government dysfunction is a drag going forward, according to a new survey. \"Markets have been roiled by the uncertainties arising out of fiscal cliff, sequestration, government shutdown, and the threat of default,\" said Anil Makhija, director of the National Center for the Middle Market. In that environment, midsize companies are \"intending to create 200,000 less jobs over the next 12 months,\" he said. Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, a business group, showed a sharp plunge in the past month, with the index falling 11 percent. Lynn Franco, the group's director of economic indicators, said: \"Consumer confidence deteriorated considerably as the federal government shutdown and debt-ceiling crisis took a particularly large toll on consumers' expectations.\" Copyright 2013 NPR.

        "webpage": "Slow US economic growth in Q4 may hide strength\nWASHINGTON (AP)  -  Most economists agree that Wednesday's snapshot of U.S. economic growth is going to look dismal.\nThe consensus forecast from Factset is economic growth slowed sharply from October through December to an annual rate of 1.2 percent. That's down from a 3.1 percent rate in the July-September quarter and would be the slowest in nearly two years.\nGrowth will probably remain sluggish at the start of the year because Americans are coming to grips with an increase in Social Security taxes that has left them with less take-home pay.\nBut economists are cautioning that the Commerce Department report may also highlight underlying strengths that could propel the economy in the second half of 2013.\n\"This is not as bad as it looks,\" said Nigel Gault, an economist at IHS Global Insight, who is forecasting a measly 0.3 percent expansion in the fourth quarter.\nA key reason economists are not too worried is the weakness was probably the result of a number of one-time factors: slower growth in stockpiles, less government spending and a wider trade gap.\nThose factors likely offset faster growth in consumer spending and the seventh straight quarter in which housing contributed to economic growth. Businesses may even have invested more in equipment and software.\nOverall, the economy probably expanded at a roughly 2 percent annual rate in the second half of 2012  -  about the same modest growth that has occurred since the recession ended three and a half years ago.\nThe subpar growth has held back hiring. The economy has created about 150,000 jobs a month, on average, for the past two years. That's barely enough to reduce the unemployment rate, which has been 7.8 percent for the past two months.\nEconomists forecast that unemployment stayed at the still-high rate again this month. The government releases the January jobs report Friday.\nThe biggest question going forward is how consumers react to the expiration of a Social Security tax cut. Congress and the White House allowed the temporary tax cut to expire in January, but reached a deal to keep income taxes from rising on most Americans.\nThe tax increase will lower take home pay this year by about 2 percent. That means a household earning $50,000 a year will have about $1,000 less to spend. A household with two high-paid workers will have up to $4,500 less.\nAlready, a key measure of consumer confidence plummeted this month after Americans noticed the reduction in their paychecks, the Conference Board reported Tuesday.\nAnd if consumer spending also fizzles, growth could stay low in the January-March quarter. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity.\nComplicating the outlook are more budget fights in Washington. A set of across-the-board spending cuts are scheduled to take effect March 1 that Congress and the White House would like to replace with more targeted cuts.\nThe nation's borrowing limit will be reached May 1 and will need to be raised so that the government can continue to pay its bills. Uncertainty over how those issues will be resolved could drag on the economy into the summer.\nBut once the budget disputes are resolved, and Americans have adjusted to the expiration of the Social Security tax cut, growth could pick up. Several positive trends are expected to fuel better growth later this year.\nConstruction firms will build more homes to meet steadily increasing demand for houses and apartments. That should create more construction jobs. And home prices are rising steadily. That makes Americans feel wealthier and more likely to spend. Housing could add as much as a percentage point to economic growth this year.\nAuto sales, meanwhile, reached the highest level in five years in 2012, and are likely to keep growing. That's boosting production and hiring at U.S. automakers and their suppliers.\nThat's making economists more optimistic about the second half of this year. Economists at JPMorgan Chase expect growth to reach a solid annual rate of 3 percent in the final three months of this year.\nAnd a quarterly survey by the National Association of Business Economics released Monday found that one-third of firms expect to add more workers in the next six months, the highest proportion since April."

        "webpage": "U.S. Borrowing Is Less Of An Economic Worry, At Least For Now By Marilyn Geewax\nFeb 4, 2014 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Stock investors looking for a reason to feel optimistic about the economy may have found one this morning. A new report shows the federal budget deficit has done some mad shrinking in recent years. Thanks to spending cuts, tax hikes and a stronger economy, the deficit in this fiscal year will be only $514 billion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday. Whoa, you might say. That's still a huge number. But compared with the whole U.S. economy, a $514 billion shortfall is manageable. It's 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)  -  down to the same level that the deficit has averaged over the past four decades. \"Things have gotten back to normal,\" said Gus Faucher, senior economist for PNC Financial Services Group. \"Spending and revenues are very close to long-run averages again.\" That's a tremendous change from 2009  -  the height of the Great Recession  -  when the annual federal budget shortfall shot to $1.4 trillion. That was about 10 percent of GDP, a level that was far outside of historical norms. Many economists worried then about the long-term drag such an enormous deficit would have on the economy. The fear is always that government might borrow so heavily that it could pull money away from businesses that need cash for expansions. If Uncle Sam were to start gobbling up nearly all of the money available for loans, then corporations and consumers would have to pay higher interest rates to attract lenders, the argument goes. That would be a formula for very slow economic growth. So Tuesday's CBO news calms those fears, and suggests that after a five-year crisis, the U.S. economy is returning to more normal footing. Stocks mostly turned positive in the morning, following a rough trading session on Monday. The CBO projects that the 2015 deficit will be even more encouraging, slipping to $478 billion, or 2.6 percent of GDP. After that, it should stay below 3 percent for the following couple of years. But the big problems come after that as government spending rises again. The projection for 2022 is back to a deficit of $1 trillion, or 4 percent of GDP. \"Spending is boosted by the aging of the population, the expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, rising health care costs per beneficiary, and mounting interest costs on federal debt,\" the CBO said. So there's plenty to worry about in the long term, but at least for now, the picture looks a little brighter. The next big government report that could help  -  or hurt  -  stock prices is due out Friday, when the Labor Department will issue its monthly jobs report.Copyright 2014 NPR. To see more, visit .

It also downgraded its assessment of business confidence and bankruptcy cases in May.\n\"Industrial production is in a weak tone\" and \"imports are flat,\" the report said.\nJapan's industrial output in March gained a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent from the previous month, but manufacturers polled by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect production to drop 1.4 percent in April and edge up 0.1 percent in May.\nThe value of imports rose 3.4 percent from a year earlier in April, up for the 18th consecutive month, although the pace of growth was much smaller than the 18.1 percent surge in March.\nWith department store and supermarket sales falling, \"Private consumption has been showing weakness lately,\" the report said.\nAn official of the Cabinet Office, however, said the slowdown since the tax hike has been \"within expectations\" so far and is likely to be \"short-lived.\"\nThe report suggested the government hopes steady improvement in corporate performance and massive public spending will help shore up the economy, despite fears that the tax hike may dampen consumer spending  -  the biggest component of gross domestic product.\nThe office raised its views on capital spending and public investment for the first time in four months and five months, respectively.\nAiming to prevent the tax hike from significantly hurting the economy, Abe's administration has formed a \u00a55.5 trillion supplementary budget for fiscal 2013 and a record-high \u00a595.9 trillion general-account budget for fiscal 2014 that started in April, including several measures beneficial to businesses.\n\"Concerning short-term prospects, although weakness will remain for the time being due to the reaction after a last-minute rise in demand, the economy is expected to recover as the effect gradually lessens, while the effects of the policies support it,\" the report said.\nThe Bank of Japan, which has been carrying out drastic monetary easing since April last year to achieve its 2 percent inflation target, is on the same page as the government on the future course of the country's economy.\n\"Japan's economy is expected to continue a moderate recovery as a trend, while it will be affected by the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike,\" the bank said in a statement released after its two-day policy board meeting, which ended Wednesday.\nCabinet Office, monthly economic report, Shinzo Abe Business"

        "webpage": "Obama's Proposed Retirement Savings Cap Hit by Pension Group\nBy Paula Aven Gladych\nApril 22, 2013 \u2022 Reprints Employees who earn less than $150,000 benefit the most from tax incentives they receive by putting money away in their employer-sponsored retirement plans.\nPlan sponsors also receive a small benefit from the tax incentives, so why eliminate tax incentives as part of tax reform?\nThose were the two big points made by Brian Graff, executive director and CEO of the American Society of Pension Professionals & Actuaries, in a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee's Pensions and Retirement Tax Reform Working Group.\nThe Obama White House has proposed doing away with these incentives after individuals are able to stash away several million to help balance the federal government's budget. But as Graff pointed out, being able to make pre-tax contributions to a retirement account doesn't mean people won't pay taxes on that money later.\nGraff, eching a point he made at the time the proposal was unveiled earlier this month, said eliminating tax incentives could have a major consequence for small-business owners who offer retirement plans. Many might stop offering such plans, he said, because there is no incentive for them to do it. As has been documented for years, because defined benefit pension plans are going away, more people are relying on workplace-sponsored plans for their savings.\nAny drop in tax incentives could have a ripple effect across the industry, Graff and others have said.\nIn his letter, Graff said that access to a retirement plan at work is the key to successfully preparing for retirement, so any modifications to the current incentives should be evaluated based on whether they will encourage more businesses to sponsor retirement plans for their employees.\n\"The current tax incentives for employer-based retirement programs have been very efficient at promoting retirement security for millions of working Americans,\" he wrote. \"If increasing retirement and financial security is the goal, increasing the availability of workplace savings is clearly the way to get there.\"\nASPPA has found that more than 70 percent of workers earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a year will participate in a workplace plan, though fewer than 5 percent will save through an IRA on their own.\nFor those families with a retirement savings account, the median percentage of the families' total financial assets held in these accounts is 65.7 percent, up from 59.6 percent in 2004.\nGraff told the committee that the most effective way to expand retirement savings is to make payroll deduction savings available to most workers.\nASPPA supports auto-IRA proposals that would require employers that do not sponsor another type of workplace retirement plan to make automatic payroll deduction IRAs available to their employees.\nThe organization opposes proposals to expand coverage that includes mandatory employer contributions.\nBusinesses already contribute to Social Security and small businesses can't afford another required contribution, it says. It says part-time employees also should have the opportunity to set money aside in a workplace retirement plan. They simply don't have to be eligible for matching company contributions, which would limit the burden to employers offering the incentive for these employees, ASPPA says.\nThe group also supports a larger Saver's Credit because it will help lower-paid workers to afford to save. If the credit were deposited to retirement savings accounts instead of refunded to the saver, it should also help supplement savings, it says. Under the president's proposal, retirement accounts would be capped at about $3.4 million in a move that would raise $9 billion for the government over the next decade. The cap would prohibit taxpayers from adding more tax-free money to their accounts once they've crossed that $3.4 million threshold.\nThis article was originally posted at BenefitsPro.com, a sister site of Credit Union Times.

        "webpage": "For investors, 13 different security regulators is 12 too many\nKeywords: It may be only a baby step, but Canada finally appears to be inching closer to addressing one of the mining industry's chief beefs about doing business in the country its fragmented approach to securities regulation. Canadian Finance Minister James Flaherty in February appointed a panel of experts to advise him on how to create a common securities regulator. The 11-member panel, headed by a former Canadian Minister of International Trade, Thomas A. Hockin, will report back to Flaherty by the end of this year.Streamlining the country's regulatory burden on companies is going to require a Herculean effort that only begins with the establishment of the panel. But after many years of bitter resentment over the complex layering of securities regulation in Canada, the government appears committed to taking action - if the ruling Conservative minority government, which lacks the majority of seats in Parliament to ensure electoral stability, stays in power long enough to see the efforts come to fruition. As of right now, overseeing the securities business in Canada is a provincial responsibility, with no less than 13 different provincial and territorial regulators. This balkanized approach has scared away investors because of overlapping layers of paperwork and compliance costs. A recent study by the Canadian Bankers Association, for instance, found that companies seeking to raise less than $10 million had issuing costs increase by 7.5 percent for each additional jurisdiction in which funds were sought. Canada is the only G-7 country without a common securities regulator, and the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of Canada and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce have all strongly suggested the country catch up with the rest of the modernized world. Past efforts have been bogged down in jurisdictional disputes. The federal government and the province of Ontario are in favor of a single national regulator. But the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec are reluctant to sign on, fearing that Ontario would be too dominant in running such a national regulator.There has been some progress on streamlining regulations, but most executives - including many in the mining industry - agree that the efforts do not go far enough and a more fundamental restructuring is needed. Most provinces and territories have endorsed a \"passport\" system, whereby a company obtaining approval in one jurisdiction would be recognized in another. In mid-March, a rule went into effect allowing a company to clear a prospectus through its home regulator and have that approval apply automatically to all provinces and territories - except Ontario, which has refused to sign on to the passport system because it falls short of a national regulatory body. That's a big problem, given that the province accounts for 80 percent of securities transactions in Canada. Efforts for a national securities regulator also have been hindered by separatists in Quebec, the country's only largely French-speaking province, which often identifies itself as a separate culture from the rest of Canada. Bloc Quebecois, an opposition party in the Canadian Parliament that advocates independence for Quebec, filed a motion earlier this year calling on the government to abandon the single-regulator concept. It worries that such nationalization of standards would diminish the province's rights in financial administration. It all adds up to continued frustration for the mining and minerals industry, which is as key to the Canadian business landscape as banking is to the United States. A poll conducted late last year by market research company Angus Reid Strategies found that 88 percent of surveyed members of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada wanted a single national securities regulator, with almost half of respondents expressing dissatisfaction with provincial securities commissions. Asked to choose between a continuation of the passport system (with Ontario as a participant) and a single national securities regulator, only 10 percent opted for the passport system.Mineral exploration companies represent about 25 percent of publicly listed companies in Canada, and what happens in the country has ramifications far beyond its own borders. Worldwide, close to half of global equity financing of mineral exploration and mine development is being raised in Canada. But the country's ranking internationally is coming under attack, facing stiff competition from Australia, South Africa, the United States and especially the United Kingdom, where the British government has implemented policies to attract and retain industry investment. It doesn't help that some of Canada's biggest names - Inco Ltd., Falconbridge Ltd. and Alcan Inc. - have been gobbled up by foreign titans in recent years. As globalization of the securities and minerals industries becomes even more entrenched, companies need to react quickly and efficiently to business opportunities. Redundancy must be rooted out to remain competitive. The federal Conservative government has taken some significant steps in achieving this goal, and the provinces and territories must now act diligently to ensure it's not a squandered opportunity."

The European Commission proposes to move to the next stage of the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) and recommends that the Council of Ministers decides that no effective action has been taken to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP in a sustainable manner. Subject to this Council decision (under Article 126(8) of the EU Treaty), the Commission will then propose to the Council new recommendations addressed to Hungary (under Article 126(7) of the Treaty) with a view to bringing to an end its excessive government deficit. Belgium, Cyprus, Malta and Poland - the other countries that were at risk of not meeting their deadlines of 2011 or 2012 to correct their excessive deficit - have taken effective action. Therefore, the Commission considers that no further steps in the excessive deficit procedure are necessary for these four countries, though it will continue to monitor budgetary developments closely. This is the first time the European Commission has applied the new rules of the strengthened Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which are part of the so-called \"six-pack\" on economic governance, which entered into force on 13 December 2011. Olli Rehn, the European Commission Vice-President for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro said: \"Today's report shows that the six-pack is already delivering. It has given the European Commission teeth to act when countries fail to bring their deficits under control and reduce their debt. Fiscal discipline is crucial to reinforce confidence in our public finances. I stand by my word: I am determined to fully use this new powerful set of tools from Day One.\"\nFor Belgium, Cyprus, Hungary, Malta and Poland, the Commission's Autumn Forecast of 10 November 2011 showed that these countries were at clear risk of not meeting their obligations to correct their excessive deficits. The next day, Vice-President Rehn sent letters to the Finance Ministers concerned making clear that, in the absence of corrective measures, further steps under the EDP, with the possibility of prompting sanctions, would become unavoidable. All four countries have since taken measures that appear sufficient to ensure a sustainable correction of the excessive deficit.\nThe budget balance in Hungary, in contrast, is heavily influenced by one-off revenues that do not result in a sustainable deficit correction. Although in 2011, Hungary formally respected the 3% of GDP reference value, this is only thanks to one-off measures worth some 10% of GPD, this budgetary outcome masks, however, a severe deterioration in the underlying structural balance. In fact, the structural budgetary position deteriorated in 2010 and 2011 by an estimated cumulative 2\u00be% of GDP in stark contrast to the recommended cumulative fiscal improvement of 0.5% of GDP. Also, in 2012, the general government deficit would remain below 3% of GDP only thanks to one-off revenues. Consequently, in 2013, the deficit is projected to reach 3\u00bc% of GDP, even without taking into account possible negative effects of a worsening in the macroeconomic scenario and rising bond yields, thus breaching the reference value of the Treaty. In sum, the correction of the excessive deficit in 2011 is not of a sustainable nature. This leads to the conclusion that Hungary has not taken effective action in response to the Council Recommendation of July 2009.\nAmadeu Altafaj Tardio (+32 2 295 26 58)\nVandna Kalia (+32 2 299 58 24)\nCatherine Bunyan (+32 2 299 65 12)"

WASHINGTON, D.C.  -  President Barack Obama is letting his jobs council expire, cutting off one source of input from business leaders while unemployment remains stubbornly high.\nObama formed the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in January 2011, when unemployment was about 9 percent. It's now 7.8 percent, though more than 12 million people are out of work.\nObama's executive order establishing the council said it would go out of business Jan. 31, 2013. The White House said Thursday that Obama had no plans to renew its charter.\n\"The work of the jobs council was very valuable,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \"While the president didn't agree with all of its recommendations, he agreed with many of them and acted on a number of them.\"\nWhite House officials said Obama intended for the council to fulfill its mission and then wind down, and that he would seek input about the economy from business leaders in other ways. Among the steps Obama plans to pursue are expedited permits for public works projects, plus programs to boost entrepreneurship and workforce development.\nEven before Obama's decision was clear, Republicans seized on the council's likely expiration as evidence the president hadn't spent enough time on trying to create jobs, which is a priority for Americans. The Republican National Committee called it part of \"the failed Obama record,\" while the House Republicans' campaign committee, in an online petition, accused Obama of laying off his own jobs council.\nAdding to the concern about the job market's vulnerability, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December of last year, the first quarterly drop since 2009. The Federal Reserve said the economy appears to have \"paused in recent months.\"\nThe jobs council was a successor to an economic advisory board Obama created at the onset of his presidency. The panel was chaired by General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt and included prominent business leaders and economists. Immelt said Thursday that progress has been made on putting in place 90 percent of the council's recommendations.\nObama met with the council only a few times. During the last meeting, in February 2012, the president and the council highlighted an engineering education initiative alongside school deans.\n\"The president treated his jobs council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nThe council's main product was a report, \"Roadmap to Renewal,\" that was released in January 2012. The council also organized a series of meetings across the country last year with business owners, elected officials and academics; Obama didn't attend those election-year sessions.\nCritics have argued that the council's primary purpose was to create the appearance of action at a time when the nation was pining for something to rein in soaring joblessness. The administration acted on many of the council's recommendations, including suggestions to streamline permitting and small business loans, increase tourist visas and boost energy efficiency.\nBut the White House was at odds with several council members on tax policies, particularly a proposal to exclude overseas corporate earnings from U.S. taxes. That idea divided even the jobs council, whose membership included labor and Obama's political allies.\n\"It was helpful in terms of putting a spotlight on a variety of issues, but particularly helpful in the area of entrepreneurship,\" said AOL co-founder Steve Case, a member of the panel, in an interview. \"There's still work to be done, but we did make good progress.\"\nThe council's dissolution also comes as White House aides are optimistic about the prospects for a second-term detente with business.\nDuring Obama's first term, business leaders bristled at his harsh depiction of \"fat-cat bankers\" and his efforts to impose regulations, tax policies and spending initiatives they argued were unfriendly to business. Obama aides hope the warming of ties between the president and the business world can benefit the White House in future fiscal debates with Republicans.\nWhite House officials said the president made a fresh effort to reach out to business in the days following his re-election. Between the November election and the end of 2012, in the height of negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff,\" more than 400 business leaders, ranging from CEOs of large multinational companies to small business owners, met with Obama or his aides at the White House, officials said."

        "webpage": "Global Watchdogs to Re-Examine Systemic Risk in Fund Industry\nSarah Krouse\nJun 30, 2014 10:46 am ET\nTwo global watchdogs plan to work together to evaluate the risks caused by asset managers, the latest development in a controversial process to determine whether the sector poses a threat to the financial system.\nThe Financial Stability Board and the International Organization of Securities Commissions are planning a consultation to help identify systemic risks posed by asset managers and market intermediaries, according to three people familiar with the matter. It's the second consultation focused on asset managers by the two organizations.\nThe new assessment is to begin later this year, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nWhile the first - which ended in April - centered on ways to identify non-bank, non-insurer systemically important financial institutions, the second will cover their activities, according to two of the people.\nThe Basel-based FSB is an international body coordinating efforts to reduce risk in financial markets in the wake of the global crisis, while Iosco is a group of international securities regulators.\nThe plans come as a number of international bodies examine risks posed by the sector. In the U.S., the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of the top U.S. financial-industry overseers, is in the early stages of identifying which asset managers may need to be drawn in for stricter federal oversight.\nThe Bank for International Settlements highlighted the issue in its annual report published on Sunday.\nThe BIS said that the growth of the asset-management sector, as well as the nature of its performance-evaluation methods and revenues could, \"exacerbate the procyclicality of asset prices.\" It said greater concentration among a small number of leading firms could have a \"disproportionate\" impact on market dynamics and warned that legal or operational problems at one of those companies potentially having systemic effects.\nThe fund-management industry has railed against previous suggestions by regulators that they or the funds they manage pose systemic risks. Trade body the Investment Company Institute called the potential designation of specific funds or firms as globally systemic important financial institutions \"unnecessary and harmful\" to fund managers, publishing a series of position papers this spring outlining its concerns.\nBlackRock Inc., Pacific Investment Management Co., T. Rowe Price and Russell Investments are among the other fund managers that have been critical of regulatory reports and consultations on the subject.\nIn the first consultation, FSB and Iosco proposed thresholds to classify which firms or funds are systemically important. It also tried to identify how systemically important firms could impact the broader markets.\nThe initial FSB and Iosco consultation followed a controversial report late last year in the U.S. by The Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research that suggested asset managers could pose systemic risks.\nMore recently, the Bank of England in the U.K. waded into the debate. Andrew Haldane, the Bank's executive director for financial stability, argued in an April speech that \"distress at an asset manager may aggravate frictions in financial markets\". He also said investor behavior was \"becoming more fickle and run-prone\".\nSIFIs\nThe Benefits of Local Banking\nBulgaria's Long Run Problems Text Size"

In an event for analysts, press and customers here on Feb. 16, executives from IBMs Software Group and its Enterprise Transformation Services Group pledged to create a new era of working together to connect data across disparate business processes. The new push brings IBMs expertise in data integration, business consulting and math science into the equation in an investment that will stretch over three years. Steve Mills, senior vice president of IBMs Software Group, said that thanks to years of technology acquisitions and advances in mathematical analysis, the time is ripe for breakthrough solutions that a few years ago couldnt be delivered. \"The capability that exists today in terms of technology allows solving problems that couldnt be solved easily a few years ago,\" he said in an interview following his presentation. \"The cost of solving the problem, the challenge of the quantity of data and the speed [at which it can be accessed and analyzed], along with the growing speed of hardware, now allows things to be [tackled] that couldnt before.\" The new age of information management will bring about \"profound changes\" in myriad industries, from health care, real-time crime fighting, financial services, government entitlement programs and manufacturing, he said. \"Profound changes in health care, for example, will come not just from basic research but from having a complete record view, not just of a patient but [other patients] whove gone through similar ailments, have received similar treatments,\" he said. One of the examples given by Mills of the direction IBM is going with information management is New York City police use of databases linked across counties, states and even the nation to find crime suspects relations to other people, known addresses and known aliases. This information, delivered wirelessly through parole cars, is helping police to solve crime in near real time, he said. Giving an example, \"An initial piece of information [regarding a nickname used at a crime scene] allowed for them to do a search, come up with a suspect based on a limited amount of information: a tattoo and a nickname,\" Mills said. \"Databases have been connected, they can run searches, they can deliver information to detectives on the scene. To read more about how police departments can use technology to fight crime, click here.\n\"Theyre also able, because we created linkages to other databases across the state and nationally, to go into hundreds of millions of records online,\" he said. \"They can do cross-checks against other information: summonses, information relative to location, neighborhood maps, maps of where other crimes have occurred. They can then try to understand the relationship of this crime event and [other] events that might lead them to other, similar crimes.\"\nChange the details, and the scenario is applicable to pretty much any industry where quick decisions based on solid business intelligence are needed. Financial services firms need to model markets fast, and Medicaid administrators need to quickly decide if theyre being double-billed or, for example, being billed by a party whos deceased.

Her job directed her attention to financial issues within the nation and to foreign policy. Her speech, \"Geopolitics and the Implications for Doing Business and Investing Around the World,\" was the fifteenth Boe Forum lecture, a series founded by Nils Boe, a South Dakota federal judge and governor.\nAlbright acknowledged the insecurities that surface from a declining economy.\n\"The economists tell us that, according to data, the recession has been over for some time, which is nice to hear but doesn't pay the bills,\" she said. \"Nor does it change the fact that Americans are having a hard time finding a job, paying for college and putting food on the table.\"\nAlbright encouraged citizens to maintain optimism, saying \"there are grounds for hope that the employment picture will improve for those that hire. And those that invest will become confident that the economy is not about to tank once again.\"\nAt a news conference for area journalism students earlier on Thursday, Albright urged investors to consider world markets.\n\"It's really good business. No country anymore is totally isolated. We have a completely integrated world and completely integrated markets.\"\nAlbright said the U.S. government needs to \"deal with the growing gap between the rich and the poor. It's wrong and it's dangerous. There is no link between poverty and terrorism, but it doesn't take a big imagination to think [it could happen].\"\nAlbright says the U.S. government has a strategy to help Afghans improve their country through \"political reform, economic development, and plans to encourage the lay down of weapons.\"\nAlbright currently serves as chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a global strategy firm, and chair of Albright Capital Management LLC, an investment advisory firm focused on emerging markets.\nAccording to the Albright Stonebridge Group, helping businesses in countries like Afghanistan establish economic stability with sound financial practices can improve more than individual businesses.\n\"Companies and communities thrive when businesses become active, contributing participants,\" said the Albright Stonebridge website.\nAlbright said Americans' attitudes have historically helped improve the global outlook.\n\"What I have felt makes America different from other places is our sense of optimism,\" she said. \"I think to some extent that has been daunted recently, and we have to get that back.\"\nThough Albright stated the process of healing will take time, she wants America to regain its dignity.\n\"I think we have a lot of work ahead of us. Our country shouldn't shy away from hard problems. I want America to get back its mojo.\"\nThroughout the speech, audience laughter roared through the Elmen center.\n\"I loved it because she was funny and amusing,\" said Augustana junior Maggie Olson. \"She didn't just talk at the audience. She was interactive and engaging.\"\nLinda Ashby, a Sioux Falls resident, said it was \"wonderful to see someone who knows what she's talking about.\"\n\"I liked her humor aspect,\" said Augustana junior Amber Fick. \"It made the whole endeavor livelier. I'm glad there are people like that in our government.\"\n\"I thought she was terrific,\" said Augustana Communications Professor Dr. Heather Bart. \"She's an example of what people can do if they put their mind to it and get a good education.\"\nRead additional accounts of Dr. Albright's visit to Augustana College for the 2010 Boe Forum on Public Affairs in the Argus Leader and USA Today.\nKelly SprecherDirector of Communications & Media"

The NCUA's stress tests would be based on Sept. 30 financial data.\nUnder the rule, these credit unions would be required to maintain a stress test capital ratio of at least 5% - higher than the 4% minimum leverage ratio required of banks since credit unions are unable to raise capital in the form of stockholder equity.\n\"Navy Federal is aware that the NCUA is drafting a proposal requiring credit unions exceeding $10B in assets to undergo annual stress tests. Navy Federal remains well-capitalized, and we will be monitoring the progress of this proposal as it goes forward,\" a Navy Federal spokesperson told Credit Union Times on Thursday.\nJim Blaine, SECU president/CEO, recommended that the NCUA relinquish stress testing to the Fed.\n\"Required stress testing by SECU seems appropriate. Consistent with the best practices of other federal regulators, we believe publication of stress test results, at least for SECU, is the best course. We feel our member-owners deserve to know the results. Much like CPA audits,\" Blaine said Thursday.\n\"NCUA should consider relinquishing the stress testing process of credit unions to the Federal Reserve, which is qualified to conduct the model results. This should save the remarkable $4 million 'outsourcing' estimate NCUA quoted. Let's use the best - the Fed,\" Blaine said.\nCarrie Hunt, senior vice president of government affairs and general counsel at NAFCU, said NAFCU has a \"huge concern\" over the cost of complying with the rule.\n\"Inevitably, we always run into this issue with NCUA in terms of looking at cost,\" she said.\n\"We don't think that we need this whole new stress testing regime,\" she added.\nHunt said the four largest credit unions do their own stress testing to have a well-run operation.\n\"We have huge questions and concerns with creating a new regulation at an enormous cost to the credit union - it's not necessary,\" she said.\nCUNA is also against the proposed rule.\n\"The agency [NCUA] will be conducting the stress testing and it's going to cost, according to them, $4 million just in the first year to conduct this stress testing - that's $1 million for each one of them,\" said Mary Dunn, CUNA senior vice president and deputy general counsel on a CUNA conference call Monday.\n\"We think it's really unclear - where did this number come from? Why is it going to cost so much and why is it necessary that the agency actually be the entity that conducts the stress testing?\" she added.\nPeter Duffy, a managing director at Sandler O'Neill and Partners, said he is not surprised the NCUA would propose a stress test rule.\n\"We expected the stress testing and capital requirements for credit unions to move toward a closer synch with community bank's regulatory expectations. The business models and balance sheets of larger credit unions and banks have evolved to be, according to the U.S Treasury's analysis (and our own) to be difficult to distinguish from each other,\" Duffy told Credit Union Times.\n\"With some exceptions, the institutions are offering the same financial products to the same customers through similar distribution channels. The CUs with assets greater than $1 billion have already begun to understand this and have been discussing this with us for the last five years. We have no reason to believe that any agency would conduct testing simply for 'gotcha' purposes,\" he added.\nIn an interview with Credit Union Times after the Oct. 24 board meeting, NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz explained why large credit unions should be subject to the rule even though they are not included in the Dodd-Frank Act stress test requirement.\n\"Our share insurance fund is $11.7 billion, so there are four credit unions with assets over $10 billion. Three of those four are larger than our share insurance fund,\" she said.\n\"So it's a very significant risk to the fund and there's no reason why a credit union of $10 billion or more should not be held to the same standard in terms of forward-looking testing that other financial institutions are held to,\" the NCUA Board chair said.

It said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero's efforts to close the budget deficit \"will materially reduce the rate of growth of the Spanish economy over the medium term.\" Lower growth would also mean gathering less in tax revenues, it said.\nThe decision echoed economists' concerns that efforts to cut state debt would hinder growth.\nEarlier Friday, the government defiantly ruled out calling early elections and instead promised more austerity, forecast lower economic growth and higher unemployment and acknowledged having almost no parliamentary support for spending cuts designed to combat Spain's share of the European debt crisis.\n\"The people gave us their trust to govern for four years. That time is not up,\" Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told a news conference after a Cabinet meeting.\nOn Thursday, a government austerity package freezing pensions and cutting civil servants' wages passed by just one vote in Parliament and opposition leaders called for a new election.\nThe austerity measures  -  which aim to cut spending by 15 billion euros ($18.4 billion) this year and next and reduce Spain's oversized deficit  -  have been welcomed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund but much criticized at home as a major reversal by the Socialists. The cuts are designed to reassure markets that Spain's government debt problems won't mushroom into a Greek-style crisis.\nEurope's top job-creator only two years ago, Spain now has the region's highest unemployment rate, at just over 20 percent, and is the slowest of the major economies to emerge from the global recession.\nThe official forecast for the jobless rate had been that it would finish the year at 19 percent, but Finance Minister Elena Salgado revised that to 19.4 percent. She raised the projections for 2011 and 2012, as well, and said that in 2013 Spain will still have a jobless rate of 16.2 percent, 0.7 points higher than the previous forecast.\nShe also gave a grim report on prospects for growth. When it approved the austerity measures last week, the government announced it would shave 0.5 percentage points off the forecast for GDP growth for 2011, taking it down to 1.3 percent. Now, in 2012 output is predicted to be 0.4 percentage points lower than originally expected, and come in at 2.5 percent, and another four percentage points lower than planned in 2013, at 2.7.\nSalgado also said the Cabinet had approved a total spending limit for 2011 that is 7.7 percent lower than the figure for this year.\nFernandez de la Vega said the government would pull Spain out of its crisis \"with the support of many citizens\"  -  she acknowledged most parties had voted against the austerity package.\nRafael Simancas, one lawmaker in Zapatero's party, wrote that had the austerity package not passed, Spain's credibility would have taken a beating in the markets, dragging down stock prices and sparking a huge rise in the government's borrowing costs.\nEven the El Pais newspaper, which generally supports Zapatero, said \"Spain came within one vote of situation that would have taken it closer to that of Greece.\"\nZapatero's party was the only one in Parliament to vote in favor of the austerity package. It passed only because three smaller parties abstained to spare Spain humiliation, not because they backed the measures.\nCountries across the European Union  -  including Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Greece and non-euro member Britain  -  have also announced spending cuts and tax increases to maintain public confidence in their ability to manage their finances. But the measures have drawn protests and criticism from union leaders, particularly in Greece.\nSome economists fear the cutbacks to appease the bond market may help kill Europe's hesitant economic recovery by withdrawing government stimulus efforts too soon."

While the Congress included Global Entrepreneurship Week host country delegations, investors and entrepreneurs, it opened last Monday with a new session for policymakers and researchers. The experiment was a success and ended with a commitment by organizers to make government policy a mainstay of the annual Congress in the future.\nA Growing Entrepreneurship Data Chest\nSummary: The greater availability of data on entrepreneurship is one of the main drivers behind the rush to build better startup ecosystems around the world. By revealing weak areas in a country's entrepreneurship ecosystem and enabling cross-country benchmarking, more data is yielding important insights for better economic and regulatory policymaking.\nMeasuring the Impact of a Startup Visa\nSummary: This week, President Obama will turn his focus from budget sequestration to immigration. A new Kauffman Foundation report released last week argues that making 75,000 Startup Visas available for current holders of H-1B and F-1 visas who start companies could create as much as 1.6 million U.S. jobs in the next 10 years. Will Washington act or, if they cannot agree, throw the baby out with the bath water?\nStartup Global\nSummary: Thousands of people from 135 countries have already confirmed their participation for next month's week-long Global Entrepreneurship Congress (GEC) and festival in Rio de Janeiro. As chair of the GEC for the past few years, I have witnessed the emergence of this global platform for collaboration among entrepreneurs, their investors and national leaders held outside the United States. So what happens at the GEC?\nFinancing Growth: Helping More Americans Help Entrepreneurs\nSummary: In his State of the Union Address next week, President Obama will shift gears back to job creation after his inauguration speech focused on wider themes. As the debate about how the government can help the economy regain its pre-recession strength enters a new phase, the Kauffman Foundation's annual \"State of Entrepreneurship Address\" last week in Washington, DC, focused on how financial constraints have been blocking the success of new and young firms that create most of the net new jobs.

The region overtook East Asia and the Pacific to become the second most business-friendly, after OECD high-income economies. However, one country, the Ukraine, has been described as the \"rotten apple\" in the region, comparing unfavorably to its neighboring countries. After meeting the \"Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Ukraine to the United States,\" I decided to take a closer look.\nAmerica's Loss is India's Gain\nSummary: This week we can expect President Obama to speak to immigration reform and a new immigration proposal to be unveiled in the Senate.

While Washington kicked the can down the road on budget cuts, the cliff was avoided - but what does the deal mean for American entrepreneurs?\nGulf States Focus on New Starts\nSummary: At the Global Entrepreneurial Summit (GES) in Dubai last week, it was clear to me that there is a new level of engagement in developing more entrepreneurial economies at the highest levels of government in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The summit, a collaboration between the U.A.E. Prime Minister's office and the Obama Administration, was an effort to leverage U.S. strengths in high growth entrepreneurship.

        "webpage": "With Record Number Of Americans Falling Into Poverty, Senator Rand Paul Says The Poor Are Getting Rich\nBy Tanya Somanader\nGlobal Research, September 20, 2011\nthinkprogress.org 20 September 2011\nTheme: Poverty & Social Inequality\nCensus data revealed today that a record 46.2 million Americans were living in poverty in 2010. But in an aptly-timed hearing entitled \"Is Poverty A Death Sentence,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) flat out rejected the idea that poverty in the U.S is worrisome. As the Ranking Member of the Senate Health subcommittee, Paul offered a dissertation-length statement on how the correlation between poverty and death is only found in the Third World and to claim such a connection within the U.S. is nothing more than \"socialism\" and \"tyranny.\" Stating that \"poor children today are healthier than middle-class adults a generation ago,\" he even blamed the poor for their own health problems, suggesting \"behavioral factors\" like a higher incidence of smoking, obesity, or weak family support structures as the only correlation between poverty and health. Citing the deficit as a primary priority, Paul questioned whether federal low-income programs are \"creating unnecessary and unhealthy dependence on government.\" He unequivocally declared that \"poverty is not a state of permanence\" and that \"the rich are getting richer, but the poor are getting richer even faster.\" PAUL: We also need to understand that poverty is not a state of permanence. When you look at people in the bottom 5th of the economic ladder  -  those at the bottom  -  only 5 percent are there after 16 years. People move up, the American dream does exist...The rich are getting richer, but the poor are getting richer even faster. Watch it:  Summing up his thesis, Paul said, \"Rather than bemoan or belabor something [poverty] that is really truly something that is overwhelmingly being treated in our country, we should maybe give more credit to the American system, the American dream, and give credit to what capitalism has done to eradicate poverty in this country.\" First of all, the notion that the poor are getting richer faster than the rich requires an impressive level of ignorance. Currently, income inequality in the United States is greater than that of Pakistan and Ethiopia and higher than at any other time since the Great Depression. Indeed, thanks to exceedingly low tax rates, the rich are getting richer, with the richest one percent earning nearly 25 percent of the total income in the country. Meanwhile, nearly one in three middle-class Americans is slipping down the income ladder as an adult. And with stagnant wages and the purchasing power of the minimum wage at a 51-year low, it's hard to see how suddenly \"the poor are getting richer faster.\" What's more, Paul's overwhelming deluge of pseudo-evidence to downplay the connection between poverty and poor health cannot shake incontrovertible facts. As the American Journal of Public Health found, deaths resulting from poverty, income inequality, and low social support each totaled more than homicide deaths in 2000. Paul's claim that Americans now have a greater life expectancy still doesn't change the fact that low-income individuals can expect to live a shorter life due to poverty. Indeed, a report released at the hearing noted that \"this is the first time in our history that children born in certain parts of the United States can expect to live shorter lives than their parents' generation.\" Articles by:\nTanya Somanader Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

        "webpage": "Senate Explores Ways to Improve Retirement Security\nBy Paula Aven Gladych\nFebruary 21, 2013 \u2022 Reprints As legislators come to grips with tax reform, budget deficits and Obamacare, retirement security also is coming under scrutiny.\nIn a recent U.S. Senate committee hearing on retirement security, Sen. Tom Harkin, chairman of the Senate pensions and education committee, mentioned that people are not saving enough for retirement.\n\"I have said this before, but the retirement income deficit - meaning the difference between what people have saved for retirement and what they should have saved - is estimated to be as high as $6.6 trillion. Half of Americans have less than $10,000 in savings.\"\nHe added that, \"these numbers are disturbing - and frightening. People who run out of money when they get old see their living standard decline, and they lean more and more on the social safety net, squeezing governments at all levels.\"\nIn the past, people could rely on personal savings, an employer-sponsored pension plan and Social Security, but pensions are going away and Social Security is in trouble.\n\"Stagnant wages and rising costs are making it tougher and tougher for people to save,\" Harkin said.\nAlthough many companies have stepped up to offer 401(k) and other defined contribution retirement plans, those rely too much on a populace that doesn't know much about investing.\nThe committee invited companies like TIAA-CREF and Fidelity to talk about how they are helping employees cope with these challenges.\n\"I am a true believer that we need to restore the three-legged stool, and that starts with rebuilding the pension system,\" he said.\nHarkin added that the government needs to do something to give middle class families the opportunity to earn a pension while making those plans more attractive to employers.\nEdward Moslander, senior managing director, institutional relationship management for TIAA-CREF, who spoke to the committee on Jan. 31, said he also is worried about the three-legged stool of retirement becoming unsteady.\nHe pointed out that only 14% of Americans are very confident they will have enough money to retire comfortably, and 60% of workers say they have less than $25,000 in retirement savings.\nIn research conducted among its own clients, TIAA-CREF found that 75% of people with higher levels of education are either very confident or somewhat confident they will be able to retire comfortably, compared to 49% of the general populace. It also found that 88 percent of those with a higher education currently are saving for retirement and 60% have tried to determine how much they need to save by the time they retire.\nFinancial literacy is a problem across the country, so \"we believe it is important to offer client tools that can assist them with making these decisions,\" Moslander said. These tools include online programs, access to financial advisors, either in person or over the phone, and comprehensive objective third-party advice programs.\nLifetime income products also should play a role in retirement security, he added.\n\"Due to our increasing lifespans, as well as the aforementioned concerns surrounding Social Security and the movement away from traditional pension plans, the draw-down phase will and should become a greater focus of the retirement security discussion,\" Moslander said.\nThe committee asked what percentage of Baby Boomers and Generation X are likely to run short of money in retirement, based on the current system/assumptions.\nAccording to Employee Benefit Research Institute research, about 44% of Baby Boomers and Generation X households are expected to not have enough money in retirement, if they retire at age 65.\nRetirement income adequacy is defined as having enough financial resources to cover basic expenses plus uninsured medical costs in retirement, according to Jack VanDerhei, research director for EBRI.\nIn May 2012, EBRI projected that the retirement shortfall for early Baby Boomers, those born between 1948 and 1954, vary from about $70,000 per individual for married households to $95,000 for single males and $105,000 for single females.\n\"The aggregate retirement income deficit number, taking into account current Social Security retirement benefits and the assumption that net housing equity is utilized 'as needed,' as well as uninsured health care costs, is currently estimated to be $4.3 trillion for all Baby Boomers and Gen Xers,\" VanDerhei said in his response to committee questions.\nWomen face an even greater challenge. Recent EBRI data found that the retirement savings shortfall for single Generation X females was $133,000. That amount is the average additional amount of savings needed at age 65 for at-risk single females in that age cohort not to run short of money in retirement. Thirteen percent of these single women could have shortfalls in excess of $200,000.\nThe biggest deficits are for women who work for companies that don't offer a 401(k) plan.\nRetirement adequacy can be improved with the presence of defined benefit plans, having future eligibility for a defined contribution plan and increasing default deferral rates to 6%, VanDerhei said.\nThis article was originally posted at BenefitsPro.com, a sister site of Credit Union Times.

        "webpage": "How to Fix Social Security While Averting Fiscal Ruin: Pozen A do-nothing Congress that lets $1.2 trillion of sequester cuts happen on March 1 may not be so bad, Bob Pozen tells IMCA crowd\nBob Pozen says were heading off the new cliff on March 1.\nBob Pozen knows how to fix Social Security, even after the United States falls off the new fiscal cliff - and the U.S. will fall, on March 1 to be exact, predicts the Harvard Business School senior lecturer and Brookings Institution fellow.\nThe solution is simple, and it doesn't involve raising taxes, the former MFS Investments chairman told an audience of 800 advisors and wealth managers at the sold-out Investment Management Consultants Association (IMCA) conference in New York on Monday.\nWhat Pozen, the author of six books, proposes instead is increasing the progressivity of the tax code. He believes that going from the current wage indexing of initial benefits to a system of price indexing would provide Social Security the reform needed to wipe away its $8.6 trillion present-value, 75-year deficit.\n\"If all we did was to switch the calculation of initial benefits and went to price indexing, how much of the $8.6 trillion would we wipe out? The answer is 100%. The question is whether we have the political will to do it,\" he said.\nUnfortunately, that political will is in short supply in Washington, Pozen added, which is why he pinpoints the March 1 cliff fall-off date, which was the new deadline set by the fiscal cliff deal passed by Congress on Jan. 2. On that day, he predicts, Congress will take no action on U.S. budget sequestration, and that will result in $1.2 trillion of automatic spending cuts, much of it related to defense.\n\"The Republicans realize that sequester is the only chance because they'll get $1.2 trillion of cuts by doing nothing,\" said Pozen, a Democrat who served on President George W. Bush's Social Security commission. \"I think it's going to get pretty messy in March and April. But maybe it's not so bad if we get this automatic cut of $1.2 trillion.\"\nBoth President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats want to avoid the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester.\nUnfortunately, Pozen added, whether liberals or conservatives, Democrats or Republicans are arguing the point, the undeniable truth is that lower-wage workers on average live a few years less than their wealthier counterparts and are less likely to have 401(k)s or other tax-advantaged plans offered by their companies.\nPrice indexing would cure Social Security's deficit, but it would also result in lower benefits to the lowest-paid workers, although no changes to Social Security's current law would trigger a 25% benefit cut across the board by 2033, Pozen noted.\nSlowing the future growth of benefits for higher earners and raising the retirement age beyond the current age of 67, but exempting lower-wage workers, could help address the gap between rich and poor, he said.\n\"The lower third of American workers don't have 401(k)s and IRAs like your clients. These lower-income people don't have the tax benefits of deferral,\" Pozen said. \"On a lifetime benefit basis, Social Security isn't progressive.\"\nCheck out Pozen Argues for $5T Plan to Cut U.S. Debt: Retirement Income Symposium at AdvisorOne.\nCheck out Fiscal Cliff Deal Opens Floodgates for 2013 Roth Conversions at AdvisorOne.\nWhat Does Divorce Really Cost?

        "webpage": "Thomas Jefferson Feared an Aristocracy of Corporations\nThe author of the Declaration of Independence warned against the threat to democracy posed by big banks and big corporations. Too bad the Supreme Court doesn't respect the original intent of the founders. By John NicholsTwitter July 4, 2010\nThomas Jefferson's name gets thrown around quite a bit these days by the Tea Partisans, which is a good thing.\nA populist movement of the right or the left that neglected Jefferson, the most radical of the first presidents, would be a sorry affair indeed. Jefferson's distrust of concentrated and consolidated power was such that he left a legacy for any and every dissenter against the state. But Jefferson did not stop there. He was, as well, a relentless critic of the monopolizing of economic power by banks, corporations and those who put their faith in what the third president referred to as \"the selfish spirit of commerce (that) knows no country, and feels no passion or principle but that of gain. Jefferson might not have wanted a lot of government, but he wanted enough government to assert the sovereignty of citizens over corporations. To his view, nothing was more important to the health of the republic. In the early years of the 19th century, as banks and corporations began to flex their political muscles, he announced that: \"I hope we shall crush... in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country.\" There are those who would have us believe that the founders intended for corporations to control our elections - and, tragically, five of these Tories sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, where they recently ruled that the nation's biggest businesses may spend whatever they like to buy the results that best serve their bottom lines. The better angels among the founders would be aghast. The framers of the American experiment were imperfect men, to be sure. Few were so radical, or so far ahead of their times, as Tom Paine, the wisest of their number. But like Paine, Jefferson was a proud revolutionary against the old order of inherited monarchy, state churches, empires and the authority of the few over the fate of the many. We know this to be true of Jefferson because, as July 4, 1826 approached, he was invited to appear in Washington for a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Age and infirmity prevented Jefferson from attending the event. But he sent a message  -  his last political statement  -  which read: \"May (July 4) be to the world, what I believe it will be  -  to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all  -  the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government. That form (of government) which we have substituted, restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God.\" So, yes, by all means, let us look to the original intent of the founders this July 4. But let us recognize what they actually said and meant about the danger posed by an \"aristocracy of corporations\" and the danger of allowing CEOs to ride roughshod over the democratic promise of the American experiment.

Experts say the decision will make it easier for shareholders to bring securities class actions against corporate defendants.\nIn the suit, Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, Amgen shareholders accused the company of misleading them between April 2004 and May 2007 by embellishing the safety of its anti-anemia drugs. The plaintiffs sought class certification based on the \"fraud on the market\" theory the Supreme Court endorsed in its 1988 Basic Inc. v. Levinson decision. The theory reasons that stock purchasers are presumed to rely on the truthfulness of publicly available information.\nIn November 2011, the 9th Circuit allowed the class action against Amgen to proceed. Amgen appealed, and various business groups supported it - including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which said the 9th Circuit's decision would encourage premature class certifications, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said the decision would force Amgen to settle possibly frivolous claims.\nNonetheless, the Supreme Court's Feb. 28 decision upheld the 9th Circuit's ruling. The court specified that though Amgen shareholders will ultimately have to prove the company's alleged misrepresentations fraudulently inflated its stock prices, they didn't need to do so at the outset of the litigation.\nRonald Miller, vice president of NERA Economic Consulting, says the Supreme Court's decision could result in more securities class actions coming through the pipeline.\n\"[Amgen] will make it easier, in some circuits, for plaintiffs to certify classes in securities class actions,\" Miller says. \"Further, by removing consideration of materiality from the class certification stage, it may make cases proceed more quickly. From the point of view of our analysis of trends in securities class actions, if, indeed, litigants had been delaying the progress of cases waiting to see the results of Amgen, then we would expect to see more settlements and more dismissals in the rest of 2013. The Supreme Court provided a clear answer that should allow litigation to move forward.\"\nChristopher McDonald, a Labaton Sucharow partner who represents the Amgen plaintiffs, says that \"the most significant takeaway for in-house counsel is that Basic v.

        "webpage": "Biological Finance\nBy Michael Flachmann Quick, what interest rates are you paying on your house loan and your credit card purchases? How much money are you earning on your savings account balance? Like it or not, coping with such questions is an inescapable burden of living in our modern, credit-oriented society. Most of us are continuously treading water in an economic whirlpool of plastic cards, Visa bills, car payments, and immense home mortgages. For an audience so sophisticated in the uses and abuses of money, Shakespeare's Timon of Athens initially appears to be a rather simple parable about the destructive consequences of borrowing money you are unable to repay. As recent scholarly research (especially articles by Michael Chorost, John Ruszkiewicz, and Coppelia Kahn) illustrates, however, the thematic concerns of the play are much deeper and more complex. At the heart of the matter is the intriguing concept of biological finance.Timon, like tribal chieftains in many primitive societies, is an archetypal \"gift-giver\" who bestows lavish presents upon the members of his clan in order to dramatize and reinforce his superior social status. His gifts are, therefore, a constant proof of his dominant position among his friends. Such ostentatious generosity helps satisfy his emotional need to be loved and revered, while at the same time creating an indebtedness among the recipients that can never be repaid. Since he is essentially manipulating people into expressing exaggerated affection for him, no true camaraderie exists in this court that seems rich in love, but is rich only in money. Unlike circular gift economies, in which presents are reciprocally given and received, Timon perpetuates a linear form of gift-giving in which his largess flows solely in one direction: from him to his beneficiaries. Such a one-sided economy creates power, but only the illusion of friendship.Finance merges with biology when Timon finally realizes that his habit of borrowing huge sums of money to support such extravagance has placed him deeply in debt. Unlike the precious jewels, paintings, statues, and other rich gifts he has given, the money he owes his various creditors has reproduced through the accumulation of interest. He now is in debt not only for the sums he has borrowed, but also for the exorbitant fees charged on the original loans.The Renaissance was an age, unlike our own, uneasy with this concept of usury: Many capitalists, like the character Antonio in The Merchant of Venice, desperately needed financial credit for business ventures, yet scorned the moneylenders for demanding interest on their loans. By setting his play in ancient Athens, Shakespeare invokes all the well-known Greek injunctions against what Aristotle called the \"unnatural\" practice of usury. Money was \"barren\": God did not intend it to \"increase\" as living creatures did; it was a method of buying goods, not a commodity in itself. Despite such warnings, rising commercialism and human avarice ensured that usury was a hotly debated ethical topic well into the seventeenth century. The constant tension between the old world and the new was further reflected in the fact that the Greek word for \"interest\" was \"tokos,\" which meant \"offspring\" or \"child.\" Even as Greece's philosophers were condemning currency as sterile, its language brought life and breath to the country's financial dealings and helped create the impression that money was organically and biologically \"alive\" since it could grow through the compounding of interest.This same concept of the reproductive nature of money not only helps explain Timon's actions in the first half of the play, when the biology of finance and the ingratitude of false friends turn him from philanthrope to misanthrope, but also in the second half, when he digs for roots in the wilderness and ironically discovers gold instead. Through the dark and brooding progress of the play, Timon has finally uncovered the \"root\" of all evil, the radix malorum - greed - which destroys everything from human relationships to entire civilizations.Shakespeare's dramatic lesson is instructive, whether his audience is the newly crowned king of England, James I, who was rapidly running up a \u00a31,000,000 debt through the corrupt Jacobean patronage system, or a poor slob in twentieth-century America trying to stay one step ahead of the credit crunch. The play speaks to us through the centuries about a world in which money breeds easily while love and friendship are sterile virtues. Unfortunately, Shakespeare's Athens looks very much like home."

        "webpage": "Not too hot, not too coldNov 2, 2012 - By Kevin G. Hall, McClatchy NewspapersWASHINGTON -- Nearing Election Day, the economy offers mixed signals to voters.\nA flurry of positive data on jobs, growth and consumer confidence suggest that the economy is slowly, steadily improving. Yet few economists think that the sluggish upward movement will improve much next year, regardless of who wins the presidential election.\nThe slow crawl back from the Great Recession has made it difficult for President Barack Obama to seek re-election. \"It could have been worse\" is hardly the sexiest of campaign slogans. It's left fertile ground for Republican challenger Mitt Romney to argue that the economy will improve under his stewardship. Think of the economy as a bowl of soup: It's not as hot as you'd like it, but it's not stone cold, either.\nThe Federal Reserve and mainstream economists forecast another sluggish year in 2013, regardless of who wins the presidency. The U.S. economy continues to face head winds that include the European debt crisis, a global slowdown, flat business investment and consumers continuing to pay down debts rather than spend at the mall.\n\"I don't see that much out there to grow beyond 2 percent to 3 percent,\" said Alan Levenson, the chief economist for investment firm T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.\nThat's not to say he doesn't see bright spots. One is housing, which added to economic growth in the latest quarter after dragging against it for the past four years. Levenson expects housing starts to grow by a modest 250,000 in 2013, bringing national housing starts to about 1 million next year.\nThe U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2 percent from July through September. Under normal times, that's a decent growth rate for a mature economy such as the United States'. But these aren't normal times, and the economy has grown in fits and spurts since the Great Recession ended in June 2009.\n\"I'd call it middling growth. If we were in the middle of an economic expansion, this would be healthy ... but given where we are we'd definitely like to see significantly faster growth than this,\" said Scott Hoyt, senior director for forecaster Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pa.\nThe unemployment rate of 7.8 percent has come down only recently to where it was when Obama took office, as alternate measures of unemployment showed large numbers of Americans working two jobs to make ends meet or slogging through jobs while searching for ones that pay better.\nBut the latest growth numbers from the Commerce Department also show that business investment fell from July to September. Economists worry that the uncertainty surrounding what happens in coming weeks regarding the federal budget crisis of looming spending cuts and tax increases _ called the fiscal cliff _ is hurting growth and investment.\nAt year's end, Bush administration-era tax reductions, extended by Obama, are set to expire. Several other tax breaks are set to end, too, and it comes as deep across-the-board spending cuts are scheduled to take effect if Congress can't reach a budget deal. On top of that, the United States is expected to hit its debt ceiling in late February or March, and the next president will have to work with Congress either to raise it or to reduce spending severely.\nIf all these things are left without a fix, it could shave more than 4 percentage points off growth. With a current growth rate around 2 percent, that would amount to instant recession at a time when the Federal Reserve and Treasury have fewer bullets left to reverse it.\nOn top of fiscal-cliff worries, China's sizzling economy has been cooling off. Few economists expect a so-called hard landing, in which employment and home prices plunge. China's growth is important for the United States, which exported more than $100 billion in goods there last year, and it's even more important for other big developing countries such as Brazil and India, which help global economic growth.\nShould Romney defeat Obama, he's pledged to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office and to pave the way for retaliatory penalties against goods that are unfairly cheap and harm U.S. manufacturers. While that's an attractive political stance, it's sure to provoke an important trading partner that's already threatened to respond in kind.\n\"I think it would be bad for the world in general,\" said Pablo Goldberg, the head of emerging market research for the big global bank HSBC.\nIf lawmakers could end their streak of gridlock and find common ground on debt and deficit issues, it could provoke more growth in the United States and abroad than currently is forecast, Goldberg said.\n\"Good news can drive the animal spirits\" and spark growth, he said.

        "webpage": "Regulators Approve Rule To Rein In Banks' Risky Trades By Scott Neuman\nDec 10, 2013 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email President Obama with Paul Volcker at the White House in 2009. Volcker, who headed the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, lent his name to a new rule aimed at curbing risk-taking on Wall Street.\nBrendan Smialowski\nOriginally published on December 10, 2013 7:33 pm The Volcker rule, a centerpiece of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law aimed at stopping some of the risky banking practices that contributed to the economic meltdown, was approved by five key regulators on Tuesday, clearing the way for its implementation. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission became the fifth and final body to approve the rule. The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. were also among the agencies that gave the green light. \"As part of this Wall Street reform, we fought to include the Volcker Rule  -  a rule that makes sure big banks can't make risky bets with their customer's deposits,\" President Obama said in a statement on Tuesday. \"The Volcker Rule will make it illegal for firms to use government-insured money to make speculative bets that threaten the entire financial system, and demand a new era of accountability from CEOs who must sign off on their firm's practices. \"Our financial system will be safer and the American people are more secure because we fought to include this protection in the law,\" the president said. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the task of financial regulatory reform \"is an ongoing exercise in remaining vigilant against market behavior that threatens the stability of our financial system. Nevertheless, completion of this rule is an important milestone.\" The Wall Street Journal reports: \"The rule will put in place new hurdles for banks that buy and sell securities on behalf of clients, known as market making, and will restrict compensation arrangements that encourage risky trading. The Fed also approved an extension to give banks until July 2015 to comply with the rule, though firms will be expected to make 'good faith' efforts to get into compliance earlier.\" As The Associated Press points out, market making \"has been very lucrative for big banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup.\" The New York Times' DealBook says that although the Volcker rule represents just one of 400 rules under Dodd-Frank, it has become \"synonymous with the law itself.\" \"In some crucial areas, regulators adopted a harder line than Wall Street had hoped. Under the rule, which bars banks from trading for their own gain and limits their ability to invest in hedge funds, the regulation includes new wording aimed at the sort of risk-taking responsible for a $6 billion trading loss at JPMorgan Chase last year. The rule also requires banks to shape compensation packages so that they do not reward 'prohibited proprietary trading.' \"In addition, it requires chief executives to attest to regulators every year that the bank 'has in place processes to establish, maintain, enforce, review, test and modify the compliance program,' a provision that did not appear in an October 2011 draft of the rule.\" NPR's John Ydstie, speaking on Here & Now, said that under the rule, banks will still be able to buy and sell securities for their customers, and they will be able to trade securities as a hedge against risks. \"The problem here is that it's very tricky figuring out whether any given trade is a hedge or simply an attempt to make a profit,\" Ydstie said. \"The Volcker rule ... says that any trade has to be tied to a certain asset and to be defensible as a hedge, designed to reduce one or more specific, identifiable risks. ... \"The rule also bans something called portfolio hedging, which can involve a huge variety of assets,\" he said, adding that's the kind of trading that got JPMorgan in trouble. Over the past three years, the Volcker rule has gone through numerous drafts, debates and was the subject of intense lobbying by Wall Street banks. In a statement, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who the rule was named after, said getting it approved was \"a long and arduous process.\" \"I look forward to a process, called for by the new regulation, in which the boards of directors and the top management of our leading commercial banks will cooperate closely in implementing the new rules within the institutions for which they are responsible,\" Volcker said. \"Appropriate internal controls and practical 'metrics' for identifying proprietary trading are central to a workable and effective administration of the regulation.\"Copyright 2013 NPR.

        "webpage": "> Analysis > Goods are freer to move; people are not Analysis\nGoods are freer to move; people are not\nBy: Tom Denton\nEmail Canada appears close to achieving another major trade agreement, this one with the European Union. While it will have its critics, increasing free trade on a global basis is arguably a good way to increase employment and spread prosperity at home and abroad.\nThere is, however, an ironic side to all this. As goods move ever more freely about the global village, the movement of the planet's people is increasingly restricted. Most Canadians won't notice. They can travel easily for business or pleasure so long as they have the money and a passport.\nThere was a time, a few generations past, when the opposite was true, when kings and countries filled their treasuries and financed their governments with duties on the movement of goods, and people migrated freely, populating colonies and continents in the process.\nThat was before income tax was invented. It was also before the population explosion that has seen the planet's population quadruple in number since 1900 after taking two million years to get to that level. Today, the developed countries are protective of their borders and restrict who gets in.\nBut attempts at human migration continue anyway. We see the pressure movingly as Syrian and Eritrean refugees attempt a Mediterranean passage to Europe and many die in the process. There is consternation across Europe as the pragmatic confronts the moral with the dilemma of choice. It is a reminder of the Vietnam War and the boat-people era.\nCanada's immigration policy lets in about 250,000 immigrants each year, but the demand has been estimated at three times that figure, driven by the reality that most who come here, or want to come, are related to someone already here. There may well be moral or ethical issues surrounding our restrictions, but the pragmatism of the moment prevails.\nRestricting who gets in is only one side of the picture. There are several countries, never democracies, that restrict who gets out. Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in their day required exit visas of anyone who wanted to leave. But it still happens today, as if to prevent those who cannot vote in free elections from voting with their feet.\nNorth Korea and Eritrea are two predictable examples of non-democratic countries that require exit visas before a citizen there can leave (and they are unlikely to be granted). What is less understandable are those countries that require exit visas for refugees that they didn't want in the first place, and who may indeed be considered illegal and liable to be deported if caught.\nThe method of getting exit visas for refugees and the amount paid for them can be murky and little talked about because it seems to happen at lower bureaucratic levels where payment is more akin to a bribe than a fee. One pays and keeps quiet for fear of rocking a delicate boat.\nFor a refugee to leave Ethiopia, the cost has seemed to be in the $150 to $500 range, although one Canadian relative reported joyfully this week there would be no fee for her three young relatives who arrive from Addis Ababa in a few days, saving her $450. Apparently their UN registration papers had exempted them -- a hopeful sign.\nSaudi Arabia is another matter. One of the world's wealthiest nations, having declared all refugees there illegal, is confronted with a dilemma: How does one give a legal document (the exit visa) to an illegal person? The answer lies in money, and payments can run as high as $5,000. There are frequent examples of scheduled refugee departures for Canada being stopped at the last moment until a bribe can be extorted from Canadian relatives.\nLast week's Strangers in New Homelands conference at the University of Manitoba lacked the scheduled participation of some foreign speakers because they were unable to get visas from Canada. This is not an unusual occurrence.\nWhether human migration difficulties lie in entrance strictures such as Canada's or departure obstacles in non-democratic states, it is ironic that increasing prosperity, at least for some, from freer trade seems to be happening at the same time as a tightening of national borders to the movement of people.\nTom Denton is executive director for refugee sponsorship at Hospitality House Refugee Ministry\nRepublished from the Winnipeg Free Press print edition October 26, 2013 A17"

Baumol\nIn this book Ralph Gomory and William Baumol adapt classical trade models to the modern world economy. Trade today is dominated by manufactured goods, rapidly moving technology, and huge firms that benefit from economies of scale. This is very different from the largely agricultural world in which the classical theories originated. Entrepreneurship, Management, and the Structure of PayoffsBy William J. Baumol\nAlthough it is admittedly difficult to theorize and make predictions on the innovative behavior and supply of entrepreneurs, William Baumol shows that by usually failing to incorporate entrepreneurship in their growth models, economists have omitted what can be a key contributor to economic growth. In this book Baumol seeks to bring entrepreneurship back into the body of mainstream economic theory. Productivity and American Leadership\nThe Long View By William J. Baumol, Sue Ann Batey Blackman and Edward N. Wolff\nProductivity and American Leadership examines and analyzes the long-run productivity performance of the United States, comparing it with that of the other industrialized nations. It shows that the U.S. record, both recent and over longer periods, is far better than is widely believed. Superfairness\nApplications and Theory By William J. Baumol\nWith his characteristic acuteness and lucidity, William Baumol, one of America's foremost economists, tackles the problem of equity considerations in welfare economics by applying the novel \"superfairness\" criterion to the distribution of resources, product, income, and wealth that arises from economic decisions. Microtheory\nApplications and Origins By William J. Baumol\nThis volume of seventeen previously published essays by William J. Baumol brings together work on the theory of contestable markets, welfare theory, antitrust, pricing, and the history of economic thought. Written between 1971 and 1983, they have sparked productive extensions and criticism in microeconomic theory and provide an engaging intellectual history of one of the leading figures in the field of economics. Baumol introduces each of the book's four parts, presenting his subsequent views on the subjects covered in the reprinted articles, including some important amendments.

        "webpage": "News Briefs and Press Releases\nCollege Home > Communications > News Home > Feature > 2010\nLegislation, Regulation, and Change\nby Cathy LockmanIs the day coming when investors who want to know about a particular company's financial report will be able to go to the company's website, click on a link to the company's auditing firm, take out their charge cards, and for $1 or $2 be able to view specific data on accounts receivable or on whether certain information has been attested to? That possibility was raised by William Ezzell, national managing partner for legislative and regulatory relations at Deloitte LLP, as he discussed the future of the accountancy profession at the Department's first Lyceum presentation of the spring semester.\"This is a period of change for accounting and auditing,\" he said, referring to issues ranging from regulatory reform proposals to the impending adoption of IFRS. \"And some people believe that our product has lost a bit of its luster. All of this together will require us to take a look at our current models and make changes where they're needed.\"While a system where investors can access all parts of an audit for a fee may be a distant, or even unlikely, change, what can the profession and the public expect in the near term? The biggest change, according to Ezzell, will come in the area of financial reporting as IFRS is adopted. \"This will be a huge issue for the profession,\" he said, \"and one for which there is not much clarity right now.\" He pointed to the lack of a mandate on timing for IFRS implementation and the differences that exist among countries who already use IFRS.A new regulatory framework is also a probability, although how far-reaching it will be remains to be seen, said Ezzell. He explained that \"economic distress is the trigger for the current call for change.\" It's a familiar cycle that starts with a scandal, then an overreaction by Congress, then backlash from business at the overregulation, and then a less aggressive stance by the regulating bodies. The current call for change could follow the same pattern, he said.With \"transparency\" as the national mantra, Ezzell predicted that \"companies will have to provide much more information to the investor.\" He also said the profession can expect more regulation, more governmental oversight, and a more active PCAOB. In addition, Ezzell believes the SEC will become more pro-investor. \"The SEC was extremely embarrassed by the Madoff scandal, and the current leadership is absolutely focused that it will not happen again. They will not be just a complaint-driven organization; they will be taking initiative.\"Additional fallout from the financial downturn in 2008-2009 could result in the full implementation of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley to include small businesses, according to Ezzell. \"This is very controversial, and there will be huge resistance to it.\" He explained that one of the problems is that it will force many small businesses to spend their limited dollars on accounting rather than on essentials to grow their business. \"This will be a very difficult choice for many businesses. They will see it as a huge cost for a small benefit.\"While Congress continues to examine legislative and regulatory options, Ezzell, who Professor Ira Solomon described as \"a person who represents the accounting profession to the power brokers in Washington,\" suggests that more accounting professionals need to make their voices heard. \"We need to convince Congress that our ideas are best for America.\"Ezzell also told students that despite the changes there is a constant that is central to the profession, and that is judgment. \"Only you can see what you see,\" he said. \"We're going to need you to bring judgment to the audit, and we'll rely on you early in your career. Just because you're new or you're not signing the audit doesn't mean you don't add value.\"For Pin-Chu Wu, a senior in accountancy, Ezzell's advice hit home. \"Before the presentation I had decided that I wouldn't pursue auditing, but he changed my mind,\" Wu said. \"He gave me a different perspective of the career path, its value, and the opportunity to build on it as a professional.\"Ezzell also advised students that as they move on in their career to remember that \"we will be relying on you to exercise your professional judgment and to carry on the reputation of the profession. There will be times in your career when you will be challenged, but remember there is no amount of money and no stroking of your ego that is worth giving up your integrity for.\"\n\u00ae Copyright 2005 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"

For nearly two decades, from the 'fistful of dollars' election campaign of 1977, to the One Nation and Fightback packages of 1993, Federal election campaigns have been dominated by promises of lower taxes. At the State level, the low level of state taxes in Queensland was the principal electoral weapon of the Bjelke-Petersen government.\nBut lower taxes inevitably means lower spending. Successive Federal governments have protected their own spending by cutting back on grants to the States. As a result, the supply of State-funded community services such as health, education and law and order has fallen behind the demand everywhere, but most notably in Queensland, where a combination of rapid population growth and low expenditure levels have led to crises in regional health services, severe shortages in health and education and overstretched physical infrastructure. Surveys now indicate that most people would be prepared to pay higher taxes in return for improved services, and political parties are beginning to respond to this need.\nAlthough the government continues to exploit the real and rhetorical benefits of low state tax rates, it recognises that the real necessity is to address the consequences of decades of inadequate levels of public spending, such as overcrowded and poorly equipped schools, hospital waiting lists and inadequate police services. The Budget announces increases in spending across the Board. Expenditure last financial year overran the Budget estimate by about 3 per cent, and a further 5 per cent increase has been announced in the Budget. By contrast, almost nothing was offered in the way of tax cuts. An increase in the payroll tax threshold has been announced, but this does little more than adjust the threshold for the general increase in wage levels.\nThe other prominent feature of the government's rhetoric is the commitment to zero net debt. While there are obvious advantages in having low (or no) debts, zero net debt is not necessarily the best rule for governments (or families) to follow. What really matters is the level of net worth. A zero net debt policy will make the State worse off if the level of infrastructure investment is held too low in order to avoid the acquisition of debt. An even worse result is obtained if more expensive methods of financing, such as so-called BOOT (Build, Own Operate and Transfer) schemes are introduced to avoid taking on debt, as has occurred with a number of tollway projects.\nOverall, though, this is a good Budget on which to fight an election. It will be hard for the Opposition, burdened by the legacy of the Bjelke-Petersen years and the continued attachment of the Federal Opposition to cuts in taxes and spending, to mount an effective counterattack.\nJohn Quiggin is Professor of Economics at James Cook University and author of Great Expectations: Microeconomic reform and Australia, published by Allen & Unwin.\nRead more articles from John Quiggin's home page\nGo to John Quiggin's Weblog\n>Read more news articles from 1995"

Eliminating the existing IIP will give Canada the opportunity to explore new ways to generate venture capital investments in support of early-stage Canadian companies.\nThe global economy has changed significantly since the IIP was created three decades ago. Investment capital flows increasingly freely across borders, and interest rates are low. Other peer countries have adapted by increasing the investment and commitment required under their programs. Under the existing IIP, Canada offers guaranteed permanent residence for an $800,000 loan. The United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand require as much as $5 to $10 million, and do not offer up-front permanent residency.\nMost immigrant investors are not making a long-term positive economic contribution to Canada. They report employment and investment income below Canadian averages and those of most other economic immigrants. Over a 20-year career, an immigrant investor pays about $200,000 less in income taxes than a federal skilled worker and almost $100,000 less in taxes than one live-in caregiver.\nA recent survey concluded that immigrant investors have the lowest official language ability of any immigrant category, including refugees. Official language ability is a key factor in the successful integration of immigrants. Data also indicate that immigrant investors are less likely than other immigrants to stay in Canada over the medium to long term.\nThe existing IIP is of limited economic benefit to Canada. There is very little \"new\" money coming into Canada. Almost all initial investments made through the program come from loans from Canadian banks to provincial governments.\nThe amount of IIP capital actively invested in economic development initiatives has been disappointing. The requirement for provinces to guarantee repayment of IIP investments after five years limits their ability to invest funds into more high-risk initiatives that tend to reap greater rewards for Canada in terms of true innovation and job creation. Fifteen years after provinces and territories were factored into the equation, less than half of the funds are actively invested.\nSimilarly, the Federal Entrepreneur Program was designed in the 1970s when Canada's economic priorities were quite different than they are today. Then, the focus was on protecting jobs in Canada. While that is still important today, a more globalized economy requires a shift towards innovation, productivity and creating better jobs and stronger businesses that can compete on a global scale.\nGiven this shift, CIC launched the Start-Up Visa in April 2013. It is designed to attract the best and brightest entrepreneurs from around the world, with ideas for new business ventures.\nSearch for related information by keyword\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada\nDepartments and agencies\nStatistics and data"

        "webpage": "House votes to restore unemployment benefits; Obama to sign immediately\nWASHINGTON -- Congress has approved legislation to restore unemployment benefits to people who have been out of work for six months or more, ending a seven-week interruption that caused 2 1/2 million people to lose unemployment benefits averaging about $300 a week.\nThe 272-152 House vote Thursday will send the measure to President Barack Obama, who has promised to quickly sign it. The House vote came less than 24 hours after a mostly party-line Senate vote Wednesday on the measure, which is just one piece of a larger Democratic jobs agenda that has otherwise mostly collapsed after months of battles with Republicans.\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Thursday Obama will sign the measure as soon as he gets it.\nRetroactive payments could go out as early as next week in some states, while in others it could take a few weeks for beneficiaries to receive their money under the legislation, which provides much-needed help to 5 million eligible unemployed workers. About half of those eligible have had their benefits cut off since funding expired June 2.\n\"Americans who are working day and night to get back on their feet and support their families in these tough economic times deserve more than obstruction and partisan game-playing,\" Obama said in a statement Wednesday night.\nThe measure is what remains of a Democratic effort launched in February to renew elements of last year's stimulus bill. But GOP opposition forced Democrats to drop $24 billion in aid to state governments to help them avoid layoffs and higher taxes, as well as a popular package of expired tax cuts and a health insurance subsidy for the unemployed.\nMost Republicans opposed the measure because it would add $34 billion to a national debt that has hit $13 trillion, arguing that it should have been paid for with cuts to other programs, such as unspent money from last year's economic stimulus bill, which is earning mixed grades at best from voters as unemployment averages 9.5 percent nationwide.\nThirty-one Republicans, about one in six, voted for the measure, while 10 Democrats opposed it.\n\"The other side says that these unemployment benefits stretching to almost two years are needed and must be added to the $13 trillion debt, even as they claim their trillion-dollar stimulus plan has been a success at creating millions of jobs,\" said Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La. \"It makes you wonder if they're looking at the same jobs data as the rest of us.\"\nIt's a change of heart for many Republicans who voted for deficit-financed unemployment benefits in the past, including twice during George W. Bush's administration. Earlier this year, Republicans allowed a temporary unemployment measure to pass without even calling for a roll call vote.\nOpinion polls show that deficits and debt are of increasing concern to voters, however, especially with Republicans' core conservative supporters and the tea party activists whose support they're courting in hopes of retaking control of Congress.\nDemocrats countered that many economists say unemployment benefits boost the economy since most beneficiaries spend them immediately, injecting money into the economy. But any such effects are likely to be modest when measured against a $14.6 trillion economy.\n\"Unemployment benefits protect those who are have lost their jobs through no fault of their own but would lead to more jobs, higher wages, and a stronger economy for all Americans,\" countered Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. \"The money will be spent immediately on necessity, injecting demand into the economy, creating jobs.\"\nThe first 26 weeks of jobless benefits are paid for by the states. Thursday's legislation renews a federally financed program providing up to 73 additional weeks of benefits in states with high unemployment rates.\nAbout half of those eligible have had their benefits cut off since funding expired June 2. They are eligible for lump-sum retroactive payments that are typically delivered directly to their bank accounts or credited to state-issued debit cards.\nIn states like Pennsylvania and New York, the back payments should go out next week, officials said. In others, like Nevada and North Carolina, it may take a few weeks for all of those eligible to receive benefits."

Now, as the massive cleanup begins, business owners, workers and investors are wondering what impact the megastorm ultimately will have on their wallets. Did Sandy weigh down economic activity enough to drown the recovery? Or will the rebuilding efforts boost growth over the longer term? Economists say Sandy's negative effects will be huge, but the U.S. economy is enormous. On Tuesday, the emerging view held that once all of the costs are counted up, Sandy will have had a big and bad impact, but not one large enough to reverse the slow-moving recovery. IHS Global Insight, a forecasting firm, estimates that the megastorm's costs  -  including interruption of business activity and damage to infrastructure  -  will total $30 billion to $50 billion. That's a big number, but much lower than the one for Hurricane Katrina, which caused around $120 billion in damages. And on a national scale, $30 billion to $50 billion in economic losses would represent just about 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent of gross domestic product. That would knock the economy's current 2 percent growth rate back to where it was this summer, but it would not kill the recovery. In such a listless economy, where roughly 12 million people are seeking work, that dip would be unwelcome. \"The effect on growth for the fourth quarter will not be catastrophic but might still be noticeable, especially in an economy with little momentum anyway,\" IHS economists Gregory Daco and Nigel Gault wrote in their analysis of Sandy's impact. Without question, the storm's rampage will be a huge negative for millions of individuals, from cruise operators to waiters who will never get the tips lost during the storm and subsequent power outages. Here are some estimates for the storm's negative impact: -- As of Tuesday morning, about 8.1 million customers were without power in the affected areas, the U.S. Department of Energy said. That means millions of people couldn't get ready for work in the morning, or their place of employment was shut down. -- IHS said Sandy idled about 70 percent of the East Coast's oil refineries, and with supplies already tight before the storm, gasoline prices could go up. But oil futures were little changed Tuesday afternoon and gasoline futures sank on speculation that the storm will cut demand as drivers stayed home and businesses were closed, Bloomberg News reported. But a megastorm can also have positive impacts as rebuilding begins. Here are some potential upsides: -- Roughly $10 billion in public infrastructure was damaged, the IHS economists estimated. That means state and local governments will have to hire more workers  -  or give them longer hours  -  to repair the roads, bridges, beaches and airports that were damaged. -- And widespread power outages mean that grocery stores will see a short-term benefit once residents restock their refrigerators after throwing out spoiled food. And that's on top of the supplies people bought to get ready before the storm hit.Copyright 2013 NPR. To see more, visit . \u00a9 2015 Northeast Indiana Public Radio"

We need to deal with that and we need to make sure we try to increase economic growth.\"\nWalker, founder and CEO of the Comeback America Initiative, discussed the current state of the United States economy with 20 AP macroeconomics students. For an hour via Skype he shared his perspective, asked and answered questions from students.\nStephen King, 17, asked \"How much deficit is truly a problem and how much is acceptable?\"\nWalker said most economists will say that having debt of no more than 60 percent of your economy is acceptable. He said United States was already over 100 percent of debt as a percentage of the economy and adding debt at record rates.\n\"What really matters is how much debt you have as a percentage of your economy,\" Walker said. \"It's okay to run deficits in a time of recession or when at war or in a major military conflict.\"\n\"The problem is over the last 30 years, people have been accustomed to running deficits even when the economy was growing and even when we were at peace and that is unacceptable.\"\nKing, a junior, said he liked that Walker was politically neutral.\n\"I felt like he was talking facts, not rhetoric,\" said King.\nWalker, who was comptroller for the Clinton and Bush administrations, told students at the outset he was a political independent, wanting every president to be successful because it is in the nation's best interest. He said both political parties were responsible for the economic shape of the country.\nThe Grand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce partnered with Grand Rapids schools to bring the fiscal responsibility discussion to the school. The classroom event was a preview of Walker's planned speech to the chamber April 3, \"Living on Borrowed Time - Solving America's Debt Crisis.\" The students were invited. David Walker, former U.S. Comptroller.\nMara Klco, 18, said she plans to attend. She said she is really into politics and considers herself well informed but Walker's comments about the country's actual debt was sobering.\nWalker told the students that the $15.5 trillion was just the tip of the iceberg. He said when you factor in the promises the government has made regarding Social Security, Medicare and other programs that makes the total liabilities and unfunded promises $65.5 trillion.\n\"There needs to be something done,\" said Klco, a senior, who said she's found there is a lot of misinformation about the economic situation.\nWalker said all levels of government are going to have to take a hard look at what they are doing - what's working and what's not working - to try to get government to be more future focused and results oriented. He said that's the way to make sure what government is doing is affordable and sustainable.\n\"That's going to be a major effort,\" he said. \"For that to happen, business leaders and other community leaders have to be more involved because they have a lot of influence and young people. This is your future.\"\nMarshal King, 17, asked \"What's the most important, significant action we should take to restore fiscal sanity? \"We have to take a lot of actions but one of the first things is to reimpose tough budget controls that will keep government from making more promises, when its already made more promises than it can keep,\" said Walker, who said that includes keeping Congress from being able to provide tax cuts that are debt finance.\nWalker said he is not a pessimist. Like other countries, he said the U.S. is capable of rising to the challenge and making the tough choices necessary to change course.\n\"More and more of the fed budget is going for consumption for seniors, and less and less is going for investment and for young people, and that is not a prescription for prosperity in the future,\" he said.\nDonijo DeJonge, comptroller for the city of Grand Rapids, and Rick Baker, president and CEO of the Grand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce, also fielded questions.\nEmail:  and follow on Twitter at ."

        "webpage": "Home | Publications | APS News | May 2009 (Volume 18, Number 5) | Inside the Beltway\nBy Michael S. Lubell, APS Director of Public Affairs Barack Obama has been in office for 100 days. It's time to take stock. Bo, a Portuguese water dog, has taken over the White House quarters that Barney and Miss Beazley, two Scottish terriers, had occupied for eight years with their feline compatriot, India, an American shorthair, who died in January shortly before the Bushes relinquished their home away from the ranch. It's the dawn of a new era! Seriously, Washington is a different town today, and it's not due just to the changing of the first-animal guard. The mood of the city is palpably altered. Despite the national economic woes, it no longer has a bunker feeling. George W. Bush was fond of calling himself a \"war president.\" And so he was in so many ways. He began his eight years in office by declaring war on taxes and ended his two-term presidency hunkered down as three decades of bipartisan financial deregulation and unbridled faith in efficient markets came unwound. In between, he declared war on terrorism, Afghanistan, Iraq, a failed American education system, and any science that didn't conveniently fit a prevailing conservative ideology. Even Bush partisans have to admit Washington became a pretty gloomy place. War, particularly the fatigue that sets in after years of battle, has a way of reducing vibrant emotional colors to depressingly gray monochromes. Still, war does have a virtue. It has a simple goal-to win. And in that regard, it has a seductiveness that's often hard to disregard. It reduces complexity to a set of seemingly achievable objectives; it sharpens the focus of the policymaking lens; and it facilitates a communications strategy suited to the thirty-second sound bite. But not every problem lends itself to a reductio ad bellum solution. You can't declare war on the collapse of the financial services industry, a sinking economy, home foreclosures, soaring health care costs, climate change, energy security, mounting public debt, a potentially unstable dollar, or the morass in the Middle East-at least not if you want to make any serious progress. These are the daunting issues facing the Obama White House. The President has a lot on his plate, and many in the world of wonks and pundits question whether he is tackling too much too fast. Concentrate on fixing the economy now and leave the rest for later, they argue. It's better to have one major political triumph, rather than progressively chip away at the myriad individual problems, no matter the public worth. But the Obama team responds that the issues they are trying to confront are linked. You can't stop the economy from sinking further without re-establishing a healthy banking system. You can't have a healthy banking system without fixing the mortgage foreclosure problem. You can't grow the economy and create jobs unless you contain energy and health costs. You can't contain energy costs and have any hope of achieving peace in the Middle East unless you become less dependent on Middle Eastern oil. You can't stabilize the dollar unless other countries have faith that the federal debt is manageable. You can't even think about reducing the federal debt unless you grow the economy. And you certainly cannot grow the economy and reduce carbon emissions unless you have a coherent, manageable climate change policy that doesn't excessively penalize consumers and businesses. The linkages are apparent; the solutions aren't. But what is unmistakable is the centrality of science's role. As a discipline, it is uniquely positioned to address complex problems of the sort our nation faces. Energy security, climate change, health care, economic competitiveness, and even a stable financial services industry require the ingenuity that scientists, mathematicians and engineers can bring to the table. The Obama Administration seems to understand the nexus and is placing a big bet on America's scientists. The White House has vowed to double the budgets of the federal programs that support basic research, including the Department of Energy's Office of Science, the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Core Programs, and the National Science Foundation. The Administration has also pledged to ramp up applied energy research in the DOE and to reinvigorate science education programs in the Department of Education and the NSF. It's been decades since America's scientists have heard the call to arms. It may not be a war, but it is a mobilization of the best and the brightest minds our country has to offer. And it's a new day for science in the nation's capital. \u00a91995 - 2016, AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY"

It's a much better term than \"fiscal cliff.\"\nThe cliff stuff makes people imagine that it's a problem of excessive deficits when it's actually about the risk that the deficit will be too small; also and relatedly, the fiscal cliff stuff enables a bait-and-switch in which people say \"So, this means that we need to enact Bowles-Simpson and raise the retirement age!\"  -  both of which have nothing at all to do with it.\nAnd it can't be emphasized enough that everyone who shrieks about the dangers of the austerity bomb is in effect acknowledging that Keynesian economists were right all along  -  that slashing spending and raising taxes on ordinary workers is destructive in a depressed economy, and that we should actually be doing the opposite.\nMeanwhile, Europe, which has had much more austerity in aggregate than we have, is seeing grim new industrial production numbers and a worsening unemployment crisis.\nBy the way, some readers have asked me what is happening to Ireland, which has seen an especially sharp fall in industrial production. The answer appears, in part, to be Lipitor. That is, expiring patents on some important drugs have created a cliff for Ireland's pharmaceutical exports. I don't want to overstate the real impact on Irish citizens: The pharmaceuticals industry looms large in Irish gross domestic product but not so much in employment because it's highly capital-intensive and much of the value-added accrues to foreign multinationals.\nStill, not what Ireland needed. Trans-Atlantic Divergence Pursuing the theme that the United States is doing the least worst among the major economies, here's a chart that I find illuminating. In the early stages of the crisis, unemployment rose more rapidly in the United States than in Europe. This mainly reflected differences in institutions: it's much easier to fire people in the United States. From some point in 2010 onward, however, the situation in the United States gradually improved; initially some of the drop in unemployment was basically people leaving the labor force, but more recently there have been solid though modest gains in the ratio of employment to the relevant population (you have to adjust for aging).\nMeanwhile, Europe, now formally in recession, has gotten much worse, but the truth is that it has been going downhill all along. Why the divergence? The obvious answer is that the austerity stuff broke out in 2010, and the austerians took over policy much more completely in Europe than in the United States. \u00a9 2014 The New York Times Company Truthout has licensed this content.

Throughout 2012 the world's central banks have flooded financial systems with new money.But unemployment remains high in many developed economies and the public's faith in business and government leaders is falling. The euro alliance and Japan are in recessions. And politicians in the United States are struggling to finalize a budget deal to avoid a potential default that would cause havoc in financial markets. Even if the U.S. does reach a deal, as expected, it could include big government spending cuts that would hurt the global economy.Schwab's WEF forum this week is expected to draw more than 2,500 of the world's financial and political elite. Organizers, journalists, political aides and others began streaming in by train and car Monday as a steady snowfall coated the region.\nGerman Klaus Schwab, founder and president of the World Economic Forum, WEF, gestures during an inte ...\nSchwab said economic growth is based on optimism, among both consumers and investors, so the challenge is for leaders \"to give people the confidence again to look with more optimism into the future.\"However, he said a fundamental problem is that the latest economic recovery is a \"jobless growth,\"  -  where any early improvement in the economy is yet to be felt in the broader job market.More socially minded entrepreneurship will be needed and young workers entering the job market will need to focus on gaining talents and skills that are most in demand, such as new technology and science, Schwab.\"We need new ways of thinking. It's not the traditional employment which will solve the issue,\" he said. \"I think we have too many sociologists, psychiatrists around, and not enough engineers and scientific people.\"Speaking on the same day as President Barack Obama's second-term public inauguration, Schwab said he hopes the world's biggest economic and military power will become more assertive on the world stage.\"What the world expects is that someone, if there's a major crisis, takes the lead, and I'm really hopeful that the United States, with the second mandate, will assume its responsibility as the strongest power,\" he said.Asked about Google's cancellation of its annual invitation-only Friday night party, which has been the hottest ticket among celebrities and elites at Davos in recent years, Schwab described it as a sign of the times.\"I think the world is in a very serious situation and the annual meeting is a very serious event. We are not a fun event. We want to improve the state of the world  -  the world is not in a good shape at the moment,\" he said. \"So I think it's really logical that we concentrate much more on substance.\"Politics & GovernmentBudget, Tax & Economy"

And uncertainty about its future often still lingers.\n\nThere are several reasons why the COO role has struggled to fully cement itself within today's C-suite. Some companies may opt instead to split operations responsibilities between several executives. In others, the CEO may decide to handle operational issues directly. But in many companies, across a range of industries and regions, changing market dynamics now provide a chance to clarify the inherent logic of the COO's role, at least for those willing to take on the challenge.\n\nNew business dynamics redefining an old role\n\nThe following factors underscore the need for an operational leader, especially within an increasingly complex and global business environment:\n\nA daunting regulatory environment\n\nA tougher emphasis on efficiency and cost management, including a drive to transform many core aspects of the business\n\nThe need to expand into new markets in the pursuit of growth\n\nThis need is further exacerbated by the increasing speed of change, from ever shorter product development life cycles to a continuously evolving technology.\n\nThe effects of this are clearly felt by today's COOs.

More so than any other executive, they are well-placed to take on such challenges and cement their position within the organization.\n\nFurthermore, adding a COO role can help to free up the CEO to focus on setting the corporate vision and goals, while then relying on the operational leader to help shape the underlying strategy and implement it. For many companies, this also acts as an effective form of succession planning.\n\nCOOs have to adapt to the environment they find themselves in\n\nUnlike other management roles, such as the CFO, there are no professional standards, nor are expectations of the job common across all organizations. Rather than possessing a single set of skills that can be easily identified in any business, COOs have to adapt, chameleon-like, to the environment in which they find themselves.\n\nEY refers to the global organization, and may refer to one or more, of the member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, each of which is a separate legal entity.

Economists applaud the law, which would basically make one region honor the rules of another.\n\"I think the reforms will go a long way to streamlining business operations in Spain by removing some of the red tape the various regions impose,\" said Walter Molano, a partner at BCP Securities investment bank in Greenwich, Connecticut. \"Each region has a great deal of autonomy in managing business transactions, taxes and trade, which imposes a great deal of difficulty on Spanish businesses.\" But not all regional politicians are expected to welcome the proposal with open arms, as in the end, scrapping bureaucracy often means stripping bureaucrats of their power. \"The problem will be in getting the regional parties to agree to the changes, since it centralizes power,\" Molano said.\nMeanwhile, Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy insists the country's economy continues to recover. He has faced calls to resign in the wake of allegations that he and senior officials in the ruling Popular Party took kickbacks, charges he has denied.\nAt a joint news conference with German chancellor Angela Merkel, as reported by the AFP newswire, Rajoy said that he had \"the same enthusiasm, the same courage, the same determination to get Spain out of the most difficult situation which it has experienced in the last 30 years as when he came to power.\"\nOther economists point out that Spain will need time to work through its problems as many banks and companies remain in weak shape.\nThis article appeared in issue March 2013"

For example, the interest rate for discounting cash receipts might be greater than the interest rate for discounting expenditures, because future inflows may be borrowed against while currently available funds may be invested temporarily pending use for future expenditures, and borrowing rates may exceed investment returns.\n\nApplications\n\nIn most applications, the entire budget would be used up, because any unspent funds would represent unobtained potential utility. In these situations, the intertemporal budget constraint is effectively an equality constraint.\n\nIn an intertemporal consumption  model, the sum of utilities from expenditures made at various times in the future, these utilities discounted back to the present at the consumer's rate of time preference, would be maximized with respect to the amounts xt consumed in each period, subject to an intertemporal budget constraint.\n\nIn a model of intertemporal portfolio choice, the objective would be to maximize the expected value or expected utility of final period wealth. Since investment returns in each period generally would not be known in advance, the constraint effectively imposes a limit on the amount that can be invested in the final period - namely, whatever the wealth accumulated as of the end of the next-to-last period is.\n\nSee also\nIntertemporal choice\n\n programming\n economics\n finance\n optimization in business"

It organizes many events and activities to inform its members with the latest news from China on politics, economics and education. It also created its scholarship program to encourage students to learn about China.\nDr. Hans Stockton, director of the Center for International Studies at UST, and Dr. Ueng recommended George for the USCPFA-Houston scholarship and also for a summer internship in China. \"George has had a passion for the Chinese culture and language, along with his outstanding leadership, maturity and strong motivation,\" Ueng said. \"He was the one of the best candidates for the scholarship and past summer internship.\" George completed his bachelor's degree with a double major in economics and international studies from UST in fall 2011. He decided to pursue the finance industry, so he applied for the summer internship and was able to experience the field of finance for the first time at Beijing Ordins Company in China.\nUSCPFA has profiled George in its brochure, where he said, \"Understanding the business norms in different parts of the world is especially important in today's globalized world.\"\nStockton said George is a real \"renaissance man\" with travels throughout the world, diverse interests, and multiple talents. \"He was an excellent student of international studies and, as a young professional, really putting his knowledge of the world and diverse cultures to good use,\" Stockton said. Stockton said the Center for International Studies has benefited greatly from the collaboration with Nancy Li of the USCPFA, for support of a growing China study abroad program. The Cameron School of Business also hopes to pursue further opportunities for MSF students through USCPFA.\nGeorge's summer internship was not his first exposure to the Chinese culture, but he had the chance to learn about the country through a study abroad expedition to Taiwan in 2009, when Dr. Stockton recommended him for the program.\n\"East Asia represents a new frontier for UST,\" Stockton said. \"Through the U-7 group, which is an offshoot of the International Consortium of Universities of St. Thomas Aquinas, we made first institutional contacts with Chinese universities, and UST is currently exploring the most efficient ways to expand into the mainland China.\" << Return"

The unemployment rate for Black men over 20 years-old fell from 11.5 percent in May to 10.9 percent in June, compared to white men who saw their jobless rate decrease from 5 percent to 4.9 percent over the same period.\nThe jobless rate for Black women over 20-years-old continued to improve, dropping one percentage point, from 10 percent in May to 9 percent in June. The unemployment rate for white women ticked down one-tenth of a percentage point from 4.9 percent in May to 4.8 percent in June.\nThe fall in the Black unemployment rate was accompanied by an increase in the groups labor force participation rate, which measures the share of Black workers holding jobs or looking for jobs. When the labor force rate rises, researchers have found that workers generally have a more positive outlook on the economy. In June, the Black labor force rate rose to 61 percent from 60.8 percent the previous month.\nIn a blog post on the jobs report, Valerie Wilson, the director of the Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy at the Economic Policy Institute, said that the increase in the labor force rates for Blacks and Latinos was another indicator that June jobs report was a strong one.\n\"The share of working age African Americans with a job has increased 1.3 percentage points since January 2014 and the increase for Latinos has been six-tenths of a percent, compared to an increase of one-tenth of a percent for whites,\" wrote Wilson. \"The June employment growth accounts for over half of this increase for African Americans and all of the gains for Latinos and whites.\nThese gains also bring the Black-white unemployment gap to the lowest level this year at a ratio of 2-to-1.\"\nWilson added: \"The fact that employment is now growing more strongly for African Americans and Latinos demonstrates how critical continued strong job growth will be to further reducing unemployment for people of color and narrowing racial unemployment gaps.\"\nThe national unemployment rate was 6.1 percent and employers added 288,000 jobs in June. The jobs numbers for April and May were revised upwards, combining for an additional 29,000 jobs over the two-month period.\nSpeaking in Washington, D.C. about the latest jobs report, President Barack Obama said that the United States has seen \"the fastest job growth in the United States in the first half of the year since 1999\" and \"the quickest drop in unemployment in 30 years.\"\nPresident Obama continued: \"So it gives you a sense that the economy has built momentum, that we are making progress. We've now seen almost 10 million jobs created over the course of the last 52 months. And it should be a useful reminder to people all across the country that given where we started back in 2008, we have made enormous strides, thanks to the incredible hard work of the American people and American businesses that have been out there competing, getting smarter, getting more effective.\"\nIn a statement on June's jobs report, Chad Stone, the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote that even though the report showed \"encouraging signs that the labor market is healing,\" millions of workers continue to struggle through periods of long-term unemployment.\nWashington lawmakers cut a crucial lifeline when they failed to extend emergency unemployment insurance (UI) at the end of last year. Millions of out-of-work Americans will lose their UI benefits by the end of 2014, if Congress doesn't act.\nEarlier this year, the Obama administration encouraged companies to sign a pledge to improve opportunities for workers who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer, a condition that Blacks suffer at disproportionate rates compared to whites.\nCompanies that signed the pledge agreed to review current recruitment and hiring practices said that they would make sure employment listings didn't discriminate against the long-term unemployed or discourage them from applying.\n\"It's a sort of economic patriotism where you say to yourself, how is it that we can start rebuilding this country to make sure that all of the young people who are here but their kids and their grandkids are going to be able to enjoy the same incredible opportunities that this country offers as we have,\" said President Obama. \"That's our job. That's what we should be focused on.\"\nIt's hard to be what you can't see\nNYPD reaches out: Launches new community policing strategy in city to build trust\nU.S. Black Chamber pressing auto dealers for fair return on Black dollars\nFact Sheet: President Obama to commemorate 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina"

ANTHONY\nMay 23, 2011 - 8:25 PM\nA rebound for Twin Cities banks since 2010 remains hobbled by a sluggish commercial real estate market, according to the quarterly survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Moreover there was little to no loan growth in the first quarter of 2011 at banks across the Upper Midwest.\n\"In terms of banking conditions ... we are still in a weak recovery,\" said Ron Feldman, senior vice president of the Minneapolis Fed, which oversees banks in the Ninth Federal Reserve District extending from Upper Michigan and western Wisconsin to Minnesota, the Dakotas and Montana.\nThe value of underlying commercial real estate that secured hundreds of millions in outstanding credit was flat in the first quarter and non-current commercial real estate loans, in which borrowers were behind, averaged about 10 percent of bank capital, down from 14 percent in 2009.\nFeldman said he was surprised that key indicators were flat in the first quarter. But he said he would not be concerned unless the trend continues.\nThe good news is that loan quality has stabilized and profitability has stopped falling.\nThe results of the quarterly Minneapolis Fed survey do not include U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo because they are chartered in states outside of the Ninth Federal Reserve District. However, Feldman said that because there are so many banks included in the study -- 694 -- the addition of the bigger banks would not substantially change the findings. Minnesota has about 400 of the district's 694 banks.\nIndeed, U.S. Bank reported in April that first quarter profits were up 56 percent over the first three months of 2010, but most of that was attributed to the fact that it needed to reserve hundreds of millions of dollars less for non-paying loans than it did in the first quarter of 2010.\nFeldman said declining provisions for likely loan losses rather than improved \"core earnings\" from interest income and fees is the major contributor to improved bank profitability. Feldman predicts that bank health will improve slowly in 2011 as the economy improves.\nThere is also belief among some bankers that 2011 will turn out well.\n\"We're seeing more loan demand than we were a year ago from good creditors,\" said CEO Tony Lemaire of St. Paul-based Western Bank, a big community bank that has been an above-average performer over the years. \"There are signs of improvement. This will be a good year of modest loan growth and profit growth.\"\nWhen will customers return?\nJennifer Thompson, a bank analyst at Portales Partners in New York City, said recently that the current lending malaise is consistent with past economic recoveries going back to the 1970s.\n\"Sooner or later, companies will have to borrow again,\" Thompson said.\nHowever, many big companies are financing most of their growth from huge cash reserves they built as they cut spending and payrolls during the recession. And lenders have been slow to provide additional credit even to good small businesses because of more-conservative loan standards and tougher bank exams.\nMinnesota banks in the first quarter, on average, had loaned an amount equivalent to about 63 percent of their deposits, compared with 71 percent at the peak of the economic expansion in 2006. Banks in South Dakota and North Dakota were loaned out at 58 percent and 56 percent, respectively.\nAs net loan growth declined by up to 5 percent across the states of the Ninth District over the last year, total assets have grown. That means that bankers have invested less in loans and more in lower-yielding U.S. government securities, which also has depressed interest income, usually the single largest source of bank revenues.\nTiny Rosemount National Bank is the only Minnesota depository that's been closed by federal regulators so far this year. Fewer than 100 of the district's 694 banks have received the two-lowest scores on a five-point scale for safety and soundness, according to federal regulators -- about the same as in 2009 and 2010.\nAbout 35 banks have failed nationally this year and about 360 since 2008.\nNeal St. Anthony \u2022 612-673-7144"

        "webpage": "Obama decides not to extend term of jobs council\nBy JOSH LEDERMANAssociated Press\nGeneral Electric Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt listens at right as President Barack Obama meets with the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. WASHINGTON, D.C.  -  President Barack Obama is letting his jobs council expire, cutting off one source of input from business leaders while unemployment remains stubbornly high.\nObama formed the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness in January 2011, when unemployment was about 9 percent. It's now 7.8 percent, though more than 12 million people are out of work.\nObama's executive order establishing the council said it would go out of business Jan. 31, 2013. The White House said Thursday that Obama had no plans to renew its charter.\n\"The work of the jobs council was very valuable,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \"While the president didn't agree with all of its recommendations, he agreed with many of them and acted on a number of them.\"\nWhite House officials said Obama intended for the council to fulfill its mission and then wind down, and that he would seek input about the economy from business leaders in other ways. Among the steps Obama plans to pursue are expedited permits for public works projects, plus programs to boost entrepreneurship and workforce development.\nEven before Obama's decision was clear, Republicans seized on the council's likely expiration as evidence the president hadn't spent enough time on trying to create jobs, which is a priority for Americans. The Republican National Committee called it part of \"the failed Obama record,\" while the House Republicans' campaign committee, in an online petition, accused Obama of laying off his own jobs council.\nAdding to the concern about the job market's vulnerability, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December of last year, the first quarterly drop since 2009. The Federal Reserve said the economy appears to have \"paused in recent months.\"\nThe jobs council was a successor to an economic advisory board Obama created at the onset of his presidency. The panel was chaired by General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt and included prominent business leaders and economists. Immelt said Thursday that progress has been made on putting in place 90 percent of the council's recommendations.\nObama met with the council only a few times. During the last meeting, in February 2012, the president and the council highlighted an engineering education initiative alongside school deans.\n\"The president treated his jobs council as more of a nuisance than a vehicle to spur job creation,\" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\nThe council's main product was a report, \"Roadmap to Renewal,\" that was released in January 2012. The council also organized a series of meetings across the country last year with business owners, elected officials and academics; Obama didn't attend those election-year sessions.\nCritics have argued that the council's primary purpose was to create the appearance of action at a time when the nation was pining for something to rein in soaring joblessness. The administration acted on many of the council's recommendations, including suggestions to streamline permitting and small business loans, increase tourist visas and boost energy efficiency.\nBut the White House was at odds with several council members on tax policies, particularly a proposal to exclude overseas corporate earnings from U.S. taxes. That idea divided even the jobs council, whose membership included labor and Obama's political allies.\n\"It was helpful in terms of putting a spotlight on a variety of issues, but particularly helpful in the area of entrepreneurship,\" said AOL co-founder Steve Case, a member of the panel, in an interview. \"There's still work to be done, but we did make good progress.\"\nThe council's dissolution also comes as White House aides are optimistic about the prospects for a second-term detente with business.\nDuring Obama's first term, business leaders bristled at his harsh depiction of \"fat-cat bankers\" and his efforts to impose regulations, tax policies and spending initiatives they argued were unfriendly to business. Obama aides hope the warming of ties between the president and the business world can benefit the White House in future fiscal debates with Republicans.\nWhite House officials said the president made a fresh effort to reach out to business in the days following his re-election. Between the November election and the end of 2012, in the height of negotiations to avert the \"fiscal cliff,\" more than 400 business leaders, ranging from CEOs of large multinational companies to small business owners, met with Obama or his aides at the White House, officials said."

        "webpage": "Don't Regulate Cyber Security\nBy Benjamin W. Powell | Posted: Mon. February 28, 2005Also published in San Diego Union-Tribune, and Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal\nPrint Should the government increase cyber security regulations for private firms? That question was debated last month at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco, and it is being debated more widely now after the huge leak at ChoicePoint, the data mining firm. Yet, the economics of cyber security and the industry's track record should make us skeptical that government regulation can improve security without damaging innovation.\nMany observers believe that there is a \"market failure\" in cyber security because firms release products with security flaws or because viruses and other cyber attacks cause economic damages. Certainly, these damages are large - the infamous Love Bug virus of 2000 cost the global economy $2.62 billion, according to the consulting firm Computer Economics. But cyber security also has costs, and it is possible to buy too much of it, just as it is possible to buy too many padlocks or burglar alarms. The economically efficient level of security requires weighing the potential benefits against the costs.\nAs long as the benefits and costs of cyber security are internal to firms and their customers, meaning they do not spill over to third parties, the market will provide the efficient level of security. Schneier assumed regulation was necessary when he complained that software makers do not have an economic incentive to improve their product since they do not take responsibility for flaws.\nBut customers demand products that have new features, are fast and come to the market quickly. They also demand some level of security in the products, but these demands are weighed against the fact they would increase costs and delay product release. If customers demand greater security in products, software developers who provide it will win out in the marketplace.\nThe greater challenge is for the market to provide efficient cyber security when some of the benefits spill over to non-customers, but even here the market often does well.\nThe financial services industry is one that is interconnected and often assumed to be part of the nation's \"critical infrastructure\" where the benefits of one firm's security may spill over to others. If there is a \"market failure\" in cyber security in the financial industry, we should find low levels of security provision and not find firms increasing security efforts. But the financial services industry shows no evidence of a market failure.\nAccording to the latest Deloitte Global Security Survey, the largest financial, banking, and insurance firms - especially U.S. firms - are employing a wide array of technologies, increasing budgets and staffing to improve cyber security. All firms employed anti-virus software, over 85 percent also used intrusion-detection and -prevention software, and most firms were experimenting with using many more advanced technologies.\nIf the spill-over benefits were great and the private returns didn't justify this level of security, we would expect security investment to decline. However, from 2003 to 2004, 63 percent of firms surveyed saw their security budgets increase while only 10 percent decreased, and nearly half of all firms increased security staffing.\nAlthough there does not appear to be a massive \"market failure\" in the provision of cyber security in the financial services industry, the introduction of government regulation would create the potential for government failure.\nAs Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, pointed out at the recent conference, \"Regulation often becomes the enemy of innovation.\" A governmental bureaucracy is almost surely going to be too slow and cumbersome to keep up with a field that changes as rapidly as information technology. Regulators are also likely to err in the direction of requiring too much security for fear of a public relations disaster. While firms also fear PR disasters, they are disciplined by profit and loss when they are overly pessimistic. Regulators face no such restraint.\nCyber security has benefits that must be weighed against costs. Reforms should be limited to examining negligence liability standards in situations where security breeches spill over to firms without contractual relations. Direct government regulation will raise costs against consumer wishes, delaying and limiting new products from coming to market. Market forces are better regulators of cyber security than government bureaucrats.\nBenjamin Powell is a Senior Fellow at The Independent Institute, Director of the Free Market Institute at Texas Tech University, and former President of the Association of Private Enterprise Education. Dr. Powell received his Ph.D. in economics from George Mason University. He has been Assistant Professor of Economics at San Jose State University, Associate Professor of Economics at Suffolk University, a Fellow with the Mercatus Center's Global Prosperity Initiative, and a Visiting Research Fellow with the American Institute for Economic Research.

        "webpage": "Peter Welch On Libor: DOJ Should 'Aggressively Prosecute' All Involved\nNate Willis\nRep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder Thursday, recommending he seriously look into the high profile Libor scandal that's swept across the U.K. and the U.S.\nNews of the scandal entered national headlines when Barclays Bank recently admitted to rigging the Libor rate, which is the average interest rate at which banks lend to one another, between 2005 and 2009.\n\"We urge the Department of Justice to carefully investigate and aggressively prosecute all senior bank officials who participated in manipulating the London interbank offered rate [Libor] throughout the financial crisis,\" the letter says in its opening statement.\nAccording to the Financial Times, the scandal affects thousands of U.S. households. \"There are at least 900,000 outstanding U.S. home loans indexed to Libor that were originated from 2005 to 2009, the period the key lending gauge may have been rigged,\" Shahien Nasiripour, reporter for the Financial Times, said in his column. Whether the Libor rate was manipulated higher or lower, it had a direct correlation to how much a household would pay on its mortgage. Barclays, a multinational banking institution, agreed to pay $450 million in a settlement on June 27 amid allegations of Libor manipulation. The Libor rate affects as much as $800 trillion in affiliated interest rates on anything from mortgages and pensions to government bonds and financial securities. \"This goes to the heart of the integrity of the financial system. It contributes to immense financial pain that ripples through the economy,\" Welch told The Huffington Post. \"To the extent that people who overpay as a result of the Libor manipulation, they should be able to get their money back. Individuals who have mortgages, pension funds who had pensioner investments -- whoever was ripped off is entitled to get their money back.\"\nOther banks headquartered in the U.S. are under investigation for their alleged involvement in the scandal, including Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.\nSens. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), both of whom sit on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote a letter to Holder on behalf of 12 Senate Democrats regarding the scandal. The letter urges Holder and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was established in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform And Consumer Protection Act, to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter of banking malfeasance that they say has had a ripple effect on the economy and individuals across the U.S. \"We are troubled that several of the world's largest financial institutions, including several based in the United States, may be involved in an effort to purposely misstate the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a key interest rate used in as much as $800 trillion worth of financial instruments,\" they say in the letter.\n\"Any illicit profits should be 'clawed back' from the banks and from the individual participants. The folks who participated in this violation of the law should spend some time behind bars. Senator Brown is right to be aggressive in this investigation,\" Welch said. \"There has to be a cop on the beat,\" he added. \"We have to send a message to these people who are entrusted with bank deposits that they can't use them for their personal gain.\"\nFinance Eric Holder Banking Democratic Caucus Sherrod Brown"

That would be a pull back from June's hefty 288,000 job gain and the monthly average of 272,000 jobs added in the second quarter.\nStill, it would mark the sixth straight month that employment has expanded by more than 200,000 jobs, a stretch last seen in 1997. The unemployment rate likely held at a six year-low of 6.1 percent, but could surprise on the downside after surveys showed Americans becoming more upbeat about jobs.\n\"As long as we have job growth going in the right direction and the labor market tightening up, we are still in a good place,\" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas\nThe economy grew at a 4.0 percent annual pace in the second quarter after shrinking at a 2.1 percent rate in the first three months of year. While restocking by businesses lifted the figure, growth is seen remaining sturdy for the rest of 2014.\nThe Labor Department will release its employment report, which is closely watched by financial markets around the globe, at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) on Friday.\nIt is set to garner even more attention in the months ahead, as investors seek to gauge when the Federal Reserve is likely to raise benchmark interest rates from near zero, where they have been since December 2008.\nFed officials on Wednesday acknowledged that labor market conditions were improving, but said \"significant\" slack remained, signaling patience on the rate front.\n\"The labor market is improving and it's improving at a faster rate than we had expected and presumably than what the Fed had expected, but there are still some concerns,\" said Dana Saporta, an economist at Credit Suisse in New York. \"The Fed gave itself some extra flexibility by putting in that sentence.\"\nMost economists look for the first increase in the second quarter of next year.\nThe jobless rate has declined from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009, but much of the drop has been because Americans have left the work force.\nThe labor force participation rate, or share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, hit 62.8 percent in October for the first time since 1978.\nIt has since stabilized at that level, a signal that more Americans see job prospects improving.\nIn another bright sign for the labor market, a broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want a job but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time jobs, hit its lowest level since October 2008 in June.\nThe ranks of the long-term unemployed are also shrinking, although they remain large. The length of time Americans are spending unemployed hit its lowest level in more than five years in June. (Reuters)"

        "webpage": "European Central Bank: CNBC Explains\nMark Koba | @MarkKobaCNBC\nThursday, 20 Oct 2011 | 1:51 PM ETCNBC.com\nThe European Central Bank - or ECB - is the central bank for Europe's single currency, the euro. Managing the euro and the countries that use it is a big task, as CNBC explains.\nRalph Orlowski | Reuters\nWhat is the ECB?\nThe ECBis considered one the most important central banks in the world. Its primary focus is to maintain the euro's purchasing power and price stability in the euro area. In simple terms, that means controlling inflation. The euro area is made up of 17 countries or nation-states that use the euro for their currency. They are: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain. The ECB was established by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1998, and is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. It has about 600 employees. The ECB is the successor to the European Monetary Institute (EMI), which was set up in 1994 to handle the transition of states dropping their own currency in order to adopt the euro.\nThe ECB is the central bank or controlling force for 17 national central banks, each serving its own country. Those central banks are the original members of the euro zone.\nAlthough the ECB is governed by European law, it's set up like a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.\nThe ECB's capital holdings are said to be around five billion euros which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. What powers does the ECB have?\nThe key power the ECB has is to implement monetary policy - basically controlling the supply of money. It also conducts foreign exchange operations and takes care of the foreign reserves, the amount of foreign currency, held by the central banks of the euro zone countries. The ECB can lend money to the central banks. It can also buy up debts of euro zone nations but only on the secondary markets. A big tool for the ECB is its ability to raise or lower interest rates for the euro zone, depending on what it sees as the best way to control inflation. The ECB has the exclusive right to issue euro banknotes and coins - the money people use. Member states can also issue euro coins, but the amount must be approved by the ECB.\nHow does the ECB compare to the U.S. Federal Reserve?\nIn some ways, they are very similar. Both the ECB and the Fed are central banks. Both have boards of governance - though set up differently - that decide on policy matters. But here is one difference. The Fed acts as the Federal Government's banker. The U.S. Treasury maintains accounts with the Fed and those accounts handle Federal tax deposits and outgoing government payments. But the ECB does not have that role. It does not handle outgoing payments for the euro zone countries or handle tax deposits.\nThe biggest difference, however, may be in the mandates. The Fed has a written policy stating it must 'promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.' That means controlling inflation as well as promoting job growth. The ECB's monetary policy does have an objective of high employment, but price stability - controlling inflation - is the primary goal.\nMark KobaSenior Editor, CNBC"

It consisted of five of President Roosevelt's cabinet-level officials: the Chairwoman was Frances Perkins, FDR's Secretary of Labor; the other members were Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr.; Attorney General Homer S. Cummings; Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace; and Harry L. Hopkins, the Federal Emergency Relief Administrator and President Roosevelt's closest adviser.\nThe Executive Director was an economics professor from the University of Wisconsin, Edwin Witte. Witte had worked in state government in Wisconsin and he was a former student of Professor John R. Commons at the University of Wisconsin. Witte was one of the nation's leading experts in social insurance and was an active member of the American Association for Labor Legislation.\nOne of the first staffers Witte would hire was a young student fresh out of the University of Wisconsin, Wilbur Cohen. Cohen was also a former student of John R. Commons, and of Witte himself. Wilbur Cohen would become the first employee of the Social Security Board and would go on to play a prominent role in Social Security for more than fifty years, including a brief tenure as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.\nThe Advisory Council was a group of 23 civic leaders from outside the Roosevelt Administration who had an interest in some fashion in the legislation to be developed.\n(Three of the members of the Advisory Council would have continued importance to Social Security. Marion Folsom would go on to become Secretary of Health, Education & Welfare in the Eisenhower Administration and John Winant and Mary Dewson would become members of the Social Security Board.)\nThe Technical Board members were an additional 21 officials from the Federal agencies, but below the cabinet level. Staff was also hired to serve the three groups and the Executive Director. At its peak about 100 people worked on the staff.\nThe most important member of the Technical Board was Arthur J. Altmeyer who was the Chairman of the Technical Board. Altmeyer was an Assistant Secretary at the Department of Labor, and he would go on to become a member of the first Social Security Board and SSA's first Commissioner.\nBreakneck Pace\nOne of the most remarkable facets of the story of the CES is how little time it had to do its work. The CES was created in June 1934, Witte did report until the end of July, most of the staff did not start work until the end of August, and the CES was required to issue its report to the President in December 1934. Six months to create an American social insurance program! The CES spent a total of $145,000 and delivered its product only a few weeks late.\nAltmeyer, Committee Counsel Thomas Eliot, Perkins and Witte met with President Roosevelt late in August to get his first-hand direction. Witte reported the meeting this way:\n\"He [the President] felt committed to both unemployment insurance and provisions for old age security and alwo wanted the committee to explore thoroughly the possibilities of a unified (package) social insurance system affording protection against all major personal hazards which lead to poverty and dependency. . .He also stated that all forms of social insurance must be self-supporting, without subsidies from general tax sources . . .[but] he understood that assistance from general tax revenues would have to be given to people already old and without means. . .he still held the view. . . that the only long-time solution of the problem of olad age security lies in a compulsory old age insurance system.\"\nIn the light of the President's directions, the CES adopted a statement of objectives at its August 13, 1934 meeting:\n\"The field of study to which the committee should devote its major attention is that of the protection of the individual against dependency and distress. This includes all forms of social insurance (accident insurance, health insurance, invalidity insurance, unemployment insurance, retirement annuities, survivors' insurance, family endowment, and maternity benefits) . . .\"\nTo organize its work, Witte and Altmeyer designated four working groups:\nUnemployment Insurance Public Employment and Relief Medical Care Old Age Security It is clear that the CES intended to produce a complete system of social insurance, in the broadest possible meaning of the term. It was to include workers' compensation, health insurance, disability insurance, unemployment compensation, old-age benefits, survivors' benefits and various types of family and maternity benefits. This was to prove an illusive challenge. When the dust settled, health insurance, disability insurance and survivors' benefits would be absent from the Administration's proposal. They would eventually become part of Social Security, one almost immediately, one not for 20 years, and one not for another 30 years. And even those parts of the \"unified package social insurance system\" that made it into the CES proposal were not without controversy and the whole undertaking was never a sure thing.

Miron\nNBER Working Paper No. 2701 (Also Reprint No. r1343)\nIssued in September 1988\nNBER Program(s): EFG\nA standard assumption in the literature on optimal monetary policy is that the proper goal of policy is the reduction of the variation in output around its natural rate level. The stabilization of output has not always been accepted as the primary goal of policy, however. This paper argues that neither the founders of the Federal Reserve System nor the central bankers in charge during the first twenty-five years of the Fed's existence viewed the elimination of short term movements in output as an important objective for policy. Instead, the framers of the Federal Reserve System and the early practitioners of central banking in the United States apparently thought that \"stabilization\" of asset markets was the crucial task for the monetary authority. The paper compares the performance of the United States economy during the twenty-five year periods before and after 1914 and shows that after the founding of the Fed the variance of both the rate of growth of output and of the inflation rate increased significantly, while the average rate of growth of output fell, and real stock prices became substantially more volatile. The remainder of the paper then suggests that the deterioration in the performance of the economy after 1914 can be attributed directly to the actions of the Fed.\n(422 K)\nThis paper is available as PDF (422 K) or via email.\nMachine-readable bibliographic record - MARC,\nRIS,\nDocument Object Identifier (DOI): 10.3386/w2701\nDe Cecco, Marcello and Alberto Giovannini (eds.)

Tom Corbett and his legal staff are hoping fine distinctions in Pennsylvania case law will allow $12 billion in cuts to future pension benefits for more than 370,000 current state and school employees.\nCorbett and state legislators are grappling with Pennsylvania's unfunded pension liability of $41 billion, and the governor is taking an approach never before tested in state courts in hopes it will help the benefit reductions pass constitutional muster.\n\"We've designed our proposal in a way we believe it is constitutional, knowing that the likelihood is that that issue will ultimately be litigated in the courts,\" state Budget Secretary Charles Zogby said.\nMore than a month after Corbett announced his plan, drawing threats of lawsuits from labor unions, the legislative response has been cool and no bill has been introduced.\nThe benefit cuts are the main source of savings in Corbett's multipronged pension reform package and are expected to save an estimated $12 billion over 30 years. The package also would require new hires to enroll in a 401(k)-style plan, instead of the traditional plan, and temporarily limit annual increases in taxpayer contributions.\nThe governor proposes freezing benefits for current employees and replacing them with reduced benefits in 2015. When workers retire, they would receive the combined value of both sets of benefits.\nThe change for members of the Public School Employees' Retirement System would occur Jan. 1, 2015; and for workers in the State Employees' Retirement System, on July 1, 2015, officials said.\nFor current employees, the biggest single change in the governor's plan is a reduction in the \"multiplier,\" a percentage applied to an employee's years of service and final average salary to calculate pensions, typically from 2.5 percent to 2 percent.\nOver the years, Pennsylvania courts have issued numerous rulings that have established that public pension benefits are contracts and that the state constitution protects them against changes that \"impair\" that contract.\nIn a 1984 decision central to the current debate, the state Supreme Court overturned a legislatively approved increase in employee contributions. The justices said the increase represented an unconstitutional impairment of contract because it reduced a pension's value by forcing the employee to pay more for it.\nCorbett's legal team says past court rulings on contract impairment have weighed both the retroactive effect of benefit changes and the future impact. By freezing current benefits and locking in their value to employees, the lawyers hope to focus any challenge exclusively on future benefits - something they say neither the Legislature nor state courts has ever done.\n\"It's a brand new analysis for the court,\" said James Schultz, the governor's general counsel. \"In short ... the (state) Supreme Court would not be put into a position where it had to overrule itself on prior precedent.\"\nUnion leaders who have led the fight against the pension cuts said the novelty of the administration's approach doesn't fundamentally change the facts.\n\"Their legal theory doesn't make any sense to me,\" said Lynne Wilson, general counsel for the Pennsylvania State Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union.\nDavid Fillman, executive director of Council 13 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, reiterated that his union would challenge the proposal if the Legislature approved it.\nSen. Jake Corman, R-Centre, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the governor's plan would provide short-term savings to taxpayers but it would not make a significant dent in the already accrued unfunded liability. But he is similarly uncomfortable with such alternatives as pension bonds, which he called \"a risky proposition.\"\n\"It's a huge issue that has to be dealt with,\" Corman said. \"People are finally coming to the realization that there's no easy answer.\""

        "webpage": "Q:\n\nFund equalisation / dividend\n\nI notice that I received dividend from a unit trust/mutual fund that I bought, and the capital I had in the unit trust was reduced by an amount similar to the dividend. Upon further investigation, I found out that this due to equalisation.\nNow I understand what is equalisation and roughly on why it is needed. My questions are\n\nDo all/most unit trusts have equalisation policy?\nDo the companies whose stocks we owned directly apply equalisation policy on their dividends as well? Why not?\n\nThese obscure investment structures are usually not explained clearly and can falsely exaggerate the investment return.\nEdit 1\nI should add that I was subjected to equalisation possibly because I invested in between 2 ex-div dates, and was quite close (~3 months) to the current ex-div date. Initially I thought that funds behave in the same way as stocks regarding ex-div and dividend handouts, but I guess I am wrong.\n\nA:\n\nWhat you are describing is a very specific case of the more general principle of how dividend payments work.\nBroadly speaking, if you own common shares in a corporation, you are a part owner of that corporation; you have the right to a % of all of that corporation's assets. The value in having that right is ultimately because the corporation will pay you dividends while it operates, and perhaps a final dividend when it liquidates at the end of its life. This is why your shares have value - because they give you ownership of the business itself.\nNow, assume you own 1k shares in a company with 100M shares, worth a total of $5B. You own 0.001% of the company, and each of your shares is worth $50; the total value of all your shares is $50k. Assume further that the value of the company includes $1B in cash. If the company pays out a dividend of $1B, it will now be only worth $4B. Your shares have just gone down in value by 20%! But, you have a right to 0.001% of the dividend, which equals a $10k cash payment to you. Your personal holdings are now $40k worth of shares, plus $10k in cash. Except for taxes, financial theory states that whether a corporation pays a dividend or not should not impact the value to the individual shareholder. \nThe difference between a regular corporation and a mutual fund, is that the mutual fund is actually a pool of various investments, and it reports a breakdown of that pool to you in a different way. If you own shares directly in a corporation, the dividends you receive are called 'dividends', even if you bought them 1 minute before the ex-dividend date. But a payment from a mutual fund can be divided between, for example, a flow through of dividends, interest, or a return of capital. If you 'looked inside' your mutual fund you when you bought it, you would see that 40% of its value comes from stock A, 20% comes from stock B, etc etc., including maybe 1% of the value coming from a pile of cash the fund owns at the time you bought your units. \nIn theory the mutual fund could set aside the cash it holds for current owners only, but then it would need to track everyone's cash-ownership on an individual basis, and there would be thousands of different 'unit classes' based on timing. For simplicity, the mutual fund just says \"yes, when you bought $50k in units, we were 1/3 of the year towards paying out a $10k dividend. So of that $10k dividend, $3,333k of it is assumed to have been cash at the time you bought your shares. Instead of being an actual 'dividend', it is simply a return of capital.\" \nBy doing this, the mutual fund is able to pay you your owed dividend [otherwise you would still have the same number of units but no cash, meaning you would lose overall value], without forcing you to be taxed on that payment. If the mutual fund didn't do this separate reporting, you would have paid $50k to buy $46,667k of shares and $3,333k of cash, and then you would have paid tax on that cash when it was returned to you. Note that this does not \"falsely exaggerate the investment return\", because a return of capital is not earnings; that's why it is reported separately. \nNote that a 'close-ended fund' is not a mutual fund, it is actually a single corporation. You own units in a mutual fund, giving you the rights to a proportion of all the fund's various investments. You own shares in a close-ended fund, just as you would own shares in any other corporation. The mutual fund passes along the interest, dividends, etc. from its investments on to you; the close-ended fund may pay dividends directly to its shareholders, based on its own internal dividend policy."

        "webpage": "search Pensions & Plunder\nE. J. McMahon, Nicole Gelinas WITH prosecutors in vestigating possible criminal misconduct in former state Comptroller Alan Hevesi's management of New York's $155 billion state pension fund, there's talk in Albany about making fundamental changes in the powers of the comptroller's office.\nThe state Constitution now gives the comptroller sole responsibility and control over the fund. But now it's been reported that Hevesi and his top deputy may have received favors from firms paid to manage pension investments.\nIn that light, Gov. Spitzer says it's \"worth taking a hard look at\" whether control of the money should be shifted from the comptroller as sole trustee to a board of trustees, likely one made up of both elected officials and public-employee representatives. Citing \"very troubling, serious, systemic conflicts of interest,\" Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is mulling an endorsement of the board concept.\nBut taking responsibility away from the elected comptroller and putting it in the hands of a board wouldn't erase these conflicts of interests. And it would reduce accountability at the pension fund, not increase it.\nMost other states, as well as New York City, have pension funds controlled by boards rather than by sole trustees. But this hasn't prevented illegal activity or mismanagement. To wit:\nIn Illinois, the feds charged last year that in 2003 and 2004, an appointed board member of the state teachers' pension fund colluded with a developer to extort millions in kickbacks from banks and investment firms seeking pension-fund business.\nIn Ohio last year, two board members at the police and fire pension fund pleaded guilty to taking thousands of dollars in gifts from companies with pension-fund business; separately, four board members of the teachers' fund pleaded guilty or no contest to similar offenses, and a fifth was convicted.\nThe case of San Diego is especially instructive. Prosecutors charge that trustees of that city's pension fund - including union representatives - violated a \"conflict of interest law\": They allowed the city to cut its payments to the plan, making it seem like the city had more money to pay for better benefits for public employees. In reality, the shift caused a huge deficit at the fund.\nIf New York amends its Constitution to set up a board to run the state pension fund, the board would inevitably include representatives of the state's powerful government unions. As California's state pension fund, Calpers, has repeatedly shown, a board that includes union reps and union-friendly politicians can use the clout of the fund's billions in taxpayer dollars to try to make companies behave in union-friendly ways, not always good for the bottom line.\nIn truth, a $155 billion pot of money will always be a potential source of temptation to anyone and everyone with a hand in steering its investments.\nThe best way to minimize corruption in the management and investment of New York's government retirement plans is to follow states like Michigan and Alaska, which are shifting newly hired workers to individual accounts, such as the 401(k) plans common in the private sector.\nInstead of managing money, the comptroller would manage the competition for individual retirement investments among as many mutual-fund and index-fund firms, banks and other investment companies as can meet some basic standards. Workers could control their own discount-brokerage retirement accounts should they choose, provided they don't exceed certain pre-defined limits like invest too high a percentage of their money in one company, sector or asset class.\nThat would be real reform - the kind of \"completely new paradigm\" that Spitzer has embraced in other contexts.\nEither way, of course, the state pension fund in its current form will be around for another generation: The state can't take away benefits already promised to today's workers and retirees. But it would be best to keep the fund's management just the way it is. Under the current system, the buck stops with the comptroller and sole trustee, now former Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli.\nIt's true that no one can guarantee that any comptroller will do a particularly good job, or even abstain from illegal activity. But as DiNapoli says, \"the ultimate accountability is at the ballot box.\" Actually, he didn't go far enough: the ultimate accountability is the possibility of criminal charges and jail time.\nNo governance structure is a guarantee against poor performance, or even criminality. But with a sole trustee, at least we'll know whodunit. Original Source:"

Since Shinzo Abe took office as prime minister in late 2012, the Japanese stockmarket has surged. A cursory glance at fund performance is also very encouraging. Over the past 12 months the average Japan fund is up 37 per cent while over six months the mean portfolio is ahead by 31 per cent. By way of comparison, the average North America portfolio is ahead by 21 per cent over the past half-year.\n\nIn addition the Bank of Japan recently delivered a report looking at the state of the nation which pointed to a wider recovery and expansion in the economy. In a statement, it said: \"With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to recover moderately on the back of the resilience in domestic demand and the pick-up in overseas economies.\"\n\nAbe's policies, dubbed 'Abenonmics', consist of a three-pronged approach, namely monetary policy, fiscal policy and economic growth strategies. His massive programme of quantitative easing is pumping some \u00a560tn (\u00a3400bn) a year into the economy while one of his key targets is to turn deflation into inflation, with an inflation target set at 2 per cent by 2015.\n\nBut Abe's plans with regards to providing a programme of structural reforms to boost growth require some major tweaking of legislation and therefore political support. As such all eyes will have been on the Japanese parliament's upper house election on 21 July, a major indictor of the public's sentiment towards the policies, which have not only sent stockmarkets north but have brought the yen lower - a major boost for exporters.\n\nPotter says: \"Even I am acknowledging that something is going on in Japan, that changes are actually taking place. There is a huge amount of quantitative easing going on and this will have an impact. Japanese corporate profitability is underestimated and we think the outlook is materially better. In addition, the yen is becoming more competitive.\"\n\nLegal & General Multi-Manager Balanced Trust co-manager Tim Gardner says the momentum which has been built and maintained since late last year is the most concerted and co-ordinated effort to pull Japan out of its economic funk in more than 20 years.\n\n\"The latest data continues to show positive signs,\" he says. \"Economic growth forecasts for Japan are currently being raised, which is hardly surprising as the Japanese economy grew at the fastest pace among the G7 economies during the first quarter of the year, with an initial estimate of a 0.9 per cent quarterly increase or 3.5 per cent per annum, which was recently revised up to 4.1 per cent.\n\n\"Add to this that the Japanese equity market is not expensive, then we remain comfortable with our high conviction position in Japanese equities across all three of our multi-manager trusts. Indeed, we used the sell-off in late May and early June to add further to our holdings.\"\n\nHenderson Income & Growth fund co-manager Paul O'Connor says the country could be one of the brighter spots within the global economy, given the dramatic change it is experiencing in its policy regime, with two of the government's three 'arrows' for growth already in flight: hyper-easy monetary policy and increased government spending.\n\n\"We can probably expect these bold measures to continue - including more related to the third policy 'arrow' of longer-term structural reforms. Abe has just outlined a series of goals which he hopes will lift Japan's growth rate to 3 per cent by 2020. These include increasing private-sector investment, infrastructure expenditure, encouraging more women into work and deregulation of goods, capital and labour markets. Consumer and business confidence has been improving and the country is also beginning to see upgrades to company earnings forecasts.\"\n\nThat said, however, O'Connor points out that the recent jump in government bond yields and equity market volatility has raised some doubts about the efficacy and sustainability of the policy shift.\n\n\"Investors are likely to remain sensitive to these issues and will require reassurances that policy changes will be managed carefully,\" he says."

        "webpage": "Occupy Wall Street Should Be Worried About America's Smartest Cities\nHere's a story about income inequality that isn't about the top one percent, or the banks, or greedy chief executives, or taxes. It's a story about geography.It begins in Austin. Perhaps the most dynamic city in the recovery, the capital of Texas benefits from a great big university, a thriving tech scene, a favorable business climate, an equally favorable actual climate, and cheap living costs for a city with so much bustle and demand. Thanks to low living costs, it's been a great place for middle-income families to find work and settle. And they really have. Austin's pool of middle-skill jobs has grown four-times faster than the national average, Conor Dougherty reports in the Wall Street Journal. Austin is a \"brain hub.\" It's got the eighth highest share of college-educated workers in the country. It's not like other brainy metros ... but in a few years it might be. There are two types of brain hub, Brookings' William Frey told Dougherty. First, there are cities like Austin, Raleigh, and Madison. You can think of them as the next generation of the Great American City. They're growing fast, adding lots of young college grads (partly because they're home to a great university), but for a number of reasons, have a more diverse mix of educated and less-educated workers moving there, as Dougherty explains. Second, you have the old guard of D.C., San Jose, San Francisco, and parts of New York -- talent magnets attracting the best and brightest. These cities have thrived for decades. They've also gotten very expensive to live in. High prices create a feedback loop of rich talent. Lots of talented rich people go there, but also low-income workers who can't afford the new speed have to leave.\nSomething to worry about if you're worried about income inequality is that as talent attracts talent, some of (or parts of) these next-gen metropolises are going to look more like D.C. and San Jose. Living costs will rise with wages. Richer families will cluster in richer neighbors. Low-income families who can't afford the new prices will have to leave. This takes them further from opportunities in the city. The gap will grow between the haves and the have-nots.The sorting of high-educated and lower-educated families is a part of the income inequality story, even though it's an externality of a pretty positive development, which is smart people trying to work and be together. You might start at the city-by-city level by pursuing housing policies that allow residential and business construction to mix so that we raise the supply (and control the inflation) of housing units. We can also think creatively about how to extend college education at an affordable price to the 65 percent of 20-somethings who don't have a degree. The bottom line is helping the 99 percent find equal opportunities goes way, way beyond marginal tax rates for the top one percent, or doling out punishments for the corporate suite."

With unique data from an online payday lender, Justin Tobias and Kevin Mumford used a novel method to see how payday loan regulation affects borrower behavior.\n\"No one had looked at the effect of payday loan policy and regulation at all. Nobody was looking at the particular policies that states can play with and their potential impacts on borrowers,\" says Mumford, assistant professor of economics. \"I was a little bit surprised by what I learned along the way.\"\nBayesian analysis of payday loans\nThe two Krannert professors teamed with Mingliang Li, associate professor of economics at the State University of New York at Buffalo, to analyze data associated with approximately 2,500 payday loans originating from 38 different states. The resulting paper, \"A Bayesian analysis of payday loans and their regulation,\" was recently published in the Journal of Econometrics.\nThe research was made possible when Mumford met the owner of a business offering payday loans. \"I secured the data without knowing what we would do with it.\" After considering options, they decided to look at the effect of payday regulations on loan amount, loan duration and loan default.\n\"Justin, Mingliang and I came up with a structural model for analyzing the key variables of interest. We made some reasonable assumptions in order to provide causal-type answers to questions like: what is the effect of lowering the interest rate on the amount borrowed and the probability of default?\"\nTobias, professor and head of the Department of Economics at the Krannert, says, \"We employed Bayesian methods to estimate key model parameters and used those results to predict how state-level policy changes would impact borrower behavior and, ultimately, lender profits. The Bayesian methods really helped to facilitate estimation and inference in this reasonably complicated setting.\"\nBetter than bouncing a check\n\"Having done this project I have less of a negative view of payday loans,\" Mumford says. \"The common payday loan was something like $300 and had a term of 14 days. The average borrower paid about $45 in interest.\"\n\"Obviously, that's a really high interest rate, but it's not totally out of line with what a bank would charge you for a bounced check. A lot of payday loans have interest charges which are smaller than that. You can see that for someone who has no access to credit, this is better than bouncing a check.\"\nKey research findings\nDecreasing the maximum interest rate that may be charged increases the length of time the loan is held and decreases the probability of default. \"People were taking longer to pay back their loan if the interest rate was lower. I was a little surprised by that,\" Mumford said.\nReducing the maximum amount that an individual may borrow decreases the length of time the loan is held and also decreases the probability of default. Despite the lower incidence of default, the net result of such a policy is not attractive for the lender. \"It's not as profitable,\" Mumford says. \"Even though they will have some additional defaults, they still make more money by loaning higher amounts.\"\nRequiring the borrowers to repay their entire loan on their next payday (instead of allowing for loan renewals) results in lower lender revenues and an approximate three percent increase in the likelihood of default.\nBorrowers try to avoid penalties such as court costs and other fees associated with default. Policies with more stringent penalties for default that also lower interest rates may be popular with both borrowers and lenders.\nJournal of Econometrics link\nYou can find the paper with complete findings at the Journal of Econometrics."

        "webpage": "Commission report: Employment and social situation in the EU continues to improve\n\nBacked by a robust economic growth, employment in the EU continued to rise more strongly than expected in the third quarter of 2017, while unemployment figures declined further according to the latest Quarterly Review on Employment and Social Developments in Europe. Compared to a year before, EU employment rose by 1.7%.\n\nThis corresponds to an additional 4 million people employed, of which 2.7 million in the euro area. Permanent jobs and full-time employment were the main contributors to this expansion. Between the third quarter of 2016 and 2017, the number of employees with permanent contracts grew by 2.8 million. This increase is three times higher than the rise in temporary contracts (900.000). The number of full-time workers surged by about 3 million, up to 181 million, while part-time workers increased by about 300.000 up to 42.7 million.\n\nThe EU employment rate of 20-64 years olds has increased consistently over the past three years, standing at 72.3% in the third quarter of 2017, the highest rate ever reached. Nonetheless, large disparities among Member States remain. National employment rates ranged from 58% in Greece to 82% in Sweden. The report also shows that unemployment in the EU is approaching pre-crisis levels at a steady pace. Unemployment has receded by around 8.6 million people since its peak recorded in April 2013 and remained below 18 million people in December 2017, the lowest level since November 2008.\n\nFurther figures on the labour market in the Quarterly Review also confirm the improved health of the EU economy: Labour productivity in the EU improved by 0.8%compared to thethird quarter of 2016. By far the strongest increase was recorded in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania (3% or more year-on-year). The financial situation of EU households continued to improve at a growth rate of around 1.5% year-on-year, mainly driven by an increase in income from work.Nearly all Member States continued to see growth in household income in the year to the first half of 2017. Nonetheless in the several countries, namely Croatia, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain as well as in the Netherlands, gross disposable household income was still below the level of 2008. Labour demand and labour shortages continued to increase.The overall job vacancy ratein the EU has reached 2% in the third quarter of 2017. The job vacancy rate was higher in services than in industry and construction. Labour shortagesincreased, and hiringactivity recovered (up 3.7% in a year to the second quarter of 2017). The separation ratesdeclined well below pre-crisis levels, while the job finding ratehas accelerated its recovery over the last quarters and approached its pre-crisis rate."

RENCH\nSEC's crowdfunding proposal: Will it work for small businesses?\nBlog Entry: February 05, 2014 4:30 AM | Author: JAMES L. RENCH\nJames L. Rench is a partner in Stark & Knoll's Business Services Group. He practices in general corporate, corporate transactions and commercial lending, and has been advising on mergers and acquisitions for more than 35 years.\nOn Jan. 16, the Small Business Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight and Regulations of the U.S House of Representatives, led by Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), held a hearing with the above title to examine the job- creating impact of crowdfunding and how the related proposed rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to affect both the crowdfunding model and small businesses seeking to use it to access capital.The witnesses at the hearing represented a diversity of views on the subject and included a law professor and former SEC attorney, a representative of the Milken Institute think tank and several representatives of the crowdfunding industry.While the recommendations from the witnesses' testimony were many and varied, there was general agreement: There remain many opportunities to strengthen and improve the proposed rules.It is up to the SEC to continue working with the public and the financial industry as it finalizes the rules to determine the best actions for accelerating economic growth and creating jobs.The essence of crowdfunding is that it should be open to all investors regardless of income or net worth and that it will be conducted online through a platform that provides investors with a forum to shape and disseminate \"the wisdom of the crowd\" regarding the offering and its prospects. It is against this backdrop that several very sensible suggested modifications to the proposed rules have emerged.First and more generally, the final rules should minimize the costs associated with crowdfunding while simultaneously limiting downside risk to investors. This should allow for the development of this new market innovation and permit issuers, platforms and investors to evaluate the probity of the \"wisdom of the crowd\" thesis. Limiting downside risk to investors can be enhanced by increased emphasis on investor caps (i.e., the percentage of income an investor may put into crowdfunding in a year). This should be coupled with increased risk warnings and emphasis on adhering to the caps by the investors. Emphasis should be placed on compliance with the caps and penalizing noncompliance.The SEC should reduce disclosure requirements to those that are mandated by the JOBS Act in order to decrease costs and allow development of crowd-driven vetting mechanisms and criteria. Boilerplate disclosure documents not even reviewed by the SEC may give investors a false sense of security. It may be better to let the \"wisdom of the crowd\" develop its own means of vetting offerings and determining those that will or will not get funded.The restriction on portals providing \"investment advice\" should include expanded \"safe harbors\" for portal filtering of offerings. As proposed, portals only may filter offerings for compliance with objective criteria (e.g., geographic or industry sector) and to exclude those that have strong indicia of fraud or raise broad investor protection concerns. The safe harbor for portal filtering of offerings should be expanded to permit exclusion of offerings as to which the portal has a strong conviction of failure.Funding portals and their principals and employees face potential \"issuer\" liability for misstatements or omissions made by the issuing companies on their platform. This potential liability would require portals to engage in time-consuming, expensive and inexact due diligence processes and may have an adverse selection effect, discouraging conservative portals and encouraging those more willing to take risks. A sound approach may be to expressly exempt portals from issuer liability for their issuers' material misstatements or omissions, unless the portal itself is complicit in those misstatements or omissions.The financial reporting requirements of the proposed rules may well be their most controversial. An independent accountant's review is required for raises from $100,000 to $500,000 and a full audit for those of more than $500,000. The initial and ongoing expense, particularly of an audit of a startup with no financial history, may cause a \"soft cap\" on offerings at $500,000 and discourage crowdfunding raises above that. A solution that will not discourage crowdfunding up to its full statutory authorization may be to dispense with an audit requirement altogether and require independent accountant reviews from $100,000 to the full $1 million authorization.With its rulemaking, the SEC has the opportunity to create a new public marketplace for equity securities. As currently proposed, the SEC rules are complex and create a number of challenging requirements for issuers and funding portals. As the commission moves forward in shaping the final rules, it would do well to not discourage their use by small businesses seeking capital through crowdfunding."

Donohue's remarks reflect the bitter residue of a years-long budget battle that has largely failed to tackle the nation's long-term fiscal problems, as well as a new focus on inequality in Washington. As in other areas, the business group is likely to clash with the Obama administration on some of its efforts to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor, even as it supports other approaches. The Chamber will back the administration's push to impose common academic standards on a primary education system that is largely administered at the state and local level, Donohue said. \"If our nation doesn't get damn serious about the millions of young people who drop out of school, or who graduate unable to master the most basic skills and work habits, nothing else we do or try is going to work,\" he said. The business group does not back Obama's effort to boost the minimum wage, Donohue said, and will oppose other efforts that would impose more regulations on business or slow economic growth. The Chamber will also try to build public support for reining in the expensive, but popular, health and pension programs for the elderly that are projected to drive the U.S. public debt in coming decades, Donohue said, though he acknowledged that effort is unlikely to bear fruit soon. \"Entitlement reform is not going to get done in a serious way for a couple of years yet. We have to work up to this,\" he said. With a lobbying budget that places it among the top interest groups in Washington, the U.S. Chamber has been a high-profile antagonist of an administration that it sees as hostile to business. The group led the push against Obama's signature healthcare law and has opposed efforts to curb greenhouse gases and tighten financial regulations. But over the past year, the Chamber and the White House have pursued common goals as both have sought to overhaul immigration rules, expand global trade and boost highway spending. Those efforts will continue this year, Donohue said. At the same time, the Chamber found itself at odds with some of the more strident elements of the Republican party as they refused to fund wide swaths of the government and pushed the country to the brink of default in a failed effort to undercut Obama's signature health care law in October. That division is likely to widen over the coming year, as the Chamber backs more pragmatic Republican candidates in primary elections. The Chamber has already spent money to back candidates in West Virginia, Idaho, Kentucky and Alabama and is considering whether to intervene in about six primary races right now, Donohue said. \"People who walk in and announce, 'I'm going to run for the House or the Senate and my idea is to burn down the town,' we're not interested in them,\" he told a press conference. The Chamber could further disappoint conservatives by seeking to modify the health reform law known as \"Obamacare\" rather than push for its repeal. \"We're not going to get rid of that bill, so we're going to have to devise ways to make it work,\" Donohue said.

        "webpage": "TRUST IS ESSENTIAL\nBy Svetlana Ryabokon, Head of Wealth Structuring and Fiduciary Services of Oracle Capital Group\n\"An individually chosen Trust provides for the effective protection of assets\"\nMost wealthy people have a broad experience of life and have independently built up successful businesses. The primary concern of all those who have gradually created their wealth is how to preserve and protect their assets from assaults by third parties. These attacks can come either from ex-business partners with whom they have had disputes; or from relatives, such as from a spouse during a marriage break-up.\nIn the long-term perspective having an effective asset protection structure in place is fundamental. This structure should help to consolidate and control the assets; and also guarantee the owner confidentiality and protect information about the assets from journalists and competitors.\nSvetlana Ryabokon\nA Trust is a flexible and effective structure of holding and management which provides maximum protection for the assets involved. The concept of a Trust developed from a desire to have divided ownership of an asset, when one individual owns a property from which another individual also benefits. When a settlor establishes a Trust, he gives up control over his assets in favor of trustees, whose professional obligations are to own those assets in favour of the third parties: the beneficiaries. The settlor himself can also be a beneficiary.\nThus, de jure the assets transferred to the Trust cease to belong to the settlor; and therefore upon a claim from a third party (such as an unsatisfied business partner) he can rightfully declare that he no longer owns the property. The same idea lies behind the use of a Trust when defending one's interests during divorce proceedings.\nIt is important to note that the decisions of foreign courts are not automatically upheld in many jurisdictions where the Trusts are established. In other words for settlement of a claim, it is necessary to go through the legal system of the country where the Trust is registered. It is not enough simply to present the decision of the court where the matter was adjudicated (generally, this will be the place of residence of the plaintiff or the respondent; or the place where the asset is located.)\nTrusts can provide efficient consolidation of a number of different assets. This can be especially useful for people whose business includes a number of companies, but where there is no centralized system for their management and control. The settlor can retain certain powers over the trustees and businesses involved in the Trust structure; whilst at the same time providing confidentiality for himself and his family members. This is because according to the Trust documentation the trustees will be the formal owners of the assets, so it is they who will be mentioned in the public documents.\nMany situations can be provided for with a Trust and the risk of loss can be minimized in the event of a change in circumstances. For example, in my practice I had a case when a wealthy client became disabled as a result of a stroke. All of his assets were registered in the names of third parties, mostly nominees; that is, people who were not close to him. Moreover, they had signing powers in the banks and when the accounts were opened they were all introduced as legal holders of these assets. The client had chosen this archaic method in order to protect himself from information disclosure. But as a result, the assets were not properly consolidated or structured. The client's wife had no information about her husband's business and bank accounts. As a result, she had to pay for expensive medical treatment and the education of their children, as well as supporting the children's grandparents without any of her husband's money being transferred to her. The only asset registered in the wife's name was the family home and a joint account for their everyday expenses. A cautionary tale indeed.\nIf this client had firstly established a Trust and placed at least a part of his assets in it; if he had then written a proper Letter of Wishes and indicated who the beneficiaries were - he himself being one of them; and if he had made provision for automatic payments for the medical treatment, education and other vital expenses, his family's life would have been a lot easier and he could have protected the family capital.\nAbout Oracle Capital Group\nFounded in 2002 and headquartered in Luxembourg, Oracle Capital Group provides comprehensive, tailored and confidential services for high-net-worth individuals and their families, including investment advisory (through their offices in Switzerland and the Bahamas), wealth structuring and asset protection, asset financing and insurance, legal case management, property development, and concierge services.

Africa's economic growth is more broad-based, argues the report, driven by domestic demand, infrastructure and increased continental trade in manufactured goods.\n\"In order to sustain the economic growth and ensure that it creates opportunities for all, African countries should continue to rebuild shock absorbers and exercise prudent macro management. Any slackening on macro management will undermine future economic growth,\" said Mthuli Ncube, Chief Economist and Vice-President of the African Development Bank.\n\"In the medium- to long-term, the opportunity for participating in global value chains, should be viewed as part of the strategy for achieving strong, sustained and inclusive growth,\" he added. The report argues that more effective participation in regional and global value chains - the range of activities in different countries that bring a product from conception to delivery to the consumer - could serve as a springboard for Africa in economic diversification, domestic resource mobilisation and investments in critical infrastructure. In order to do so, however, the continent needs to avoid getting stuck in low value-added activities.\nFor instance, Africa's exports to the rest of the world grew faster than those of any other region in 2012, but they remain dominated by primary commodities and accounted for only 3.5 percent of world merchandise exports in 2012.\nAvoiding that trap involves investing in new and more productive sectors, building skills, creating jobs and acquiring new technology, knowledge and market information. These interventions require sound public policies, as well as entrepreneurs that are willing and capable of helping achieve these gains.\nThe report uses the example of South Africa, which achieved a remarkable turnaround in its automotive industry by removing obstacles and providing incentives for component producers and assembly lines. It also shows that the development of agribusiness value chains in countries such as Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia has contributed to economic growth and job creation.\n\"African economies have a great potential to build on their demographic dynamism, rapid urbanisation and natural-resources assets. The challenge now for many of them is to ensure that greater insertion into global value chains is achieved and has a positive impact on people's lives,\" said Mario Pezzini, Director of the OECD Development Centre.\n\"Public policies need to be articulated in a targeted strategy that promotes more equitable economic and social transformation and an environmentally sound development,\" he added.\nThe African Economic Outlook shows that there has been remarkable progress in human development, with lower poverty levels, rising incomes and improving rates of school enrollment and health coverage.\nFurther achieving real human development gains requires empowering people and ensuring environmental sustainability, so that economic growth can yield benefits for all. In order for value chains to effectively integrate the poor and marginalized, often including women, targeted public policies and inclusive business models should facilitate access to productive assets such as land and financing, enhance productivity, and improve the resilience of small producers.\n\"As engagement with global value chains deepens, the appropriate measures need to be in place to mitigate the risks which they can bring about, such as volatile prices, unfair competition and increased vulnerability,\" said Pedro Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Chief Economist at UNDP's Regional Bureau for Africa. \"While regional and global economic networks present immense opportunities, women, men and communities must be able to compete from a position of strength.\" For the full report, including statistics and 54 individual country notes, please visit .\nFor more information on the African Development Bank's 2014 Annual Meetings, visit .

How Much Income Taxes Could Rise: A Breakdown Of The Options By John Ydstie\nNov 30, 2012 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday after private talks with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.\nOriginally published on November 30, 2012 9:46 am \"No substantive progress has been made.\" That's what House Speaker John Boehner had to say Thursday about efforts to avoid automatic spending cuts and tax increases at year's end. The administration's lead negotiator, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, met with congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle Thursday, looking for an agreement on the hazard Congress and the White House created last year to focus their minds on deficit reduction. Perhaps the most important sticking point is over income tax rates. The outcome of the negotiations will determine how many Americans will face higher tax rates  -  and how much of a hike it will be. Obama's Proposal President Obama has proposed that top tax rates for well-off Americans rise to their levels from before the Bush-era tax cuts. But he wants to keep the Bush tax cuts for the middle class. So income tax rates for couples making less than $250,000 and individuals making less than $200,000 would remain where they are. What would that mean for you? Well, if you're among the well-off and earn more than those amounts, the money you make above those levels would be taxed at 36 percent and 39.6 percent  -  up a few points from where they are taxed now, and exactly where they were during the Clinton administration. For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, this change would boost their tax bill a lot. \"That tax increase would amount to something in the neighborhood of $120,000,\" says Donald Marron, co-director of the Tax Policy Center. The center has crunched a lot of numbers related to the tax effects of the fiscal cliff and the various proposals to avoid it. Len Burman, who used to run the center but now is a professor at Syracuse University, says allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for the well-off would put a dent in the deficit. \"Raising the tax rates to basically the pre-Bush levels for the high-income people would raise about $850 billion over 10 years,\" he says. But would that be a bulldozer-size dent or a baseball-size dent in the deficit? \"It's significant ... but we're looking at $10 trillion-plus in deficits over the next 10 years, so this is less than 10 percent of the total,\" Burman says. The president would reduce the deficit an additional 5 percentage points through his proposal to reduce the value of tax deductions for the wealthy. The Fiscal Plunge Scenario But what if policymakers can't reach an agreement and we go over this fiscal cliff? Tax rates would go up across the board. The Tax Policy Center says about 90 percent of Americans would see their tax bill increase. \"For a middle-income household, this increase would be around $2,000; for a low-income household, it would be around $400,\" says center co-director Marron. While that's not a pleasant thought, allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for everyone would cut deficits significantly, Burman says. \"We'd raise $2.2 trillion in income tax revenues over the next 10 years and $430 billion in estate tax revenues,\" he says. That would cut projected deficits by about 25 percent over the next 10 years  -  a much more sizable chunk, but still not enough to solve the deficit problem. Of course, the shock to the economy of the abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts would likely cause the economy to plunge back into recession. That's really why they call it the \"fiscal cliff.\" GOP Pushes Tax Reform Republicans say hiking rates for anyone is the wrong approach. They want to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone for one more year. That would mean a $400 billion boost to next year's projected deficit. But during the year, Republicans say, Washington could work on changes to tax policy and entitlements and try to close the budget gap for the long term. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia University's School of Business and an adviser to Mitt Romney, agrees. He says raising rates is a bad idea. \"I'd rather see us talk about tax reform,\" Hubbard says. \"That is, have the Congress say, 'OK, here's the dollars that we need to raise in revenue, now let's talk about a better tax system.' \"Copyright 2013 NPR.

NCUA Ponders Fees for Derivatives Rule\nMay 20, 2013 \u2022 Reprints NCUA Board Members Debbie Matz and Michael Fryzel said they are eagerly anticipating comments on a rule that would grant new investment authorities but could set a pay-to-play precedent that concerns trade associations.\nThe proposed rule, introduced during the board's monthly board meeting May 16, would grant qualifying credit unions the ability to use derivative swaps and caps to hedge against interest rate risk.\nHowever, because of the cost to the NCUA-as high as $16 million in temporary staffing costs over the first three years and up to $4 million in the years that follow-the final rule could also include an application fee or an on-going supervision fee to be paid only by those credit unions applying for and utilizing the authority.\nAlthough Chairman Matz said she supports the rule, she also said because the agency has never before charged such fees, she's \"not sure if it's the way to go.\"\nFryzel said new authority mitigates risk to the share insurance fund, so it could be argued that the entire industry should shoulder the cost. However, he added that credit unions that don't seek the authority could also rightly argue only those who have it should pay.\nAdditionally, Fryzel said he would like to hear suggestions regarding whether the NCUA should seek to cover all costs for the program or just part, and if application fees, annual fees or other fee structures would be appropriate.\n\"The fee is a big deal,\" said Paul Gentile, CUNA executive vice president of strategic communications and engagement. \"The NCUA knows these credit unions already, so what is the fee paying for?\"\nNAFCU Regulatory Counsel Tessema Tefferi said he's also concerned the fees could create a barrier to entry for credit unions interested in seeking derivative authority and could also set a dangerous precedent for future rules.\nComments on the proposed rule will be due 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register.\nThe derivate authority would be available only to credit unions that have more than $250 million in assets, have an overall CAMEL rating of 3 or better with a management rating of 2 or better and can demonstrate to the NCUA how derivatives are part of the credit union's overall interest rate risk strategy.\nThe authority would have two levels. Level II would have higher transaction limits but would also require more stringent requirements, a higher application fee and more supervision.\nThe NCUA estimated between 75 and 150 credit unions would apply for the authority, with 75% seeking Level I, and the remaining 25% seeking Level II.\nThe rule would only permit derivative swaps and caps, which Matz called plain vanilla.\nDirector of the Division of Capital and Credit Markets J. Owen Cole explained that derivative swaps involve a credit union entering into an agreement where it would pay out a fixed rate while receiving a floating rate. In today's low rate environment, the fixed rate would likely be higher at first, Cole said. However, should rates increase, the floating rate would likely pay more, hedging interest rate risk.\nWith a derivative cap, a credit union would receive a check if rates rise above the cap. However, should rates not risk, Cole said, the risk would be that if rates don't rise, the credit union would pay out a one-time premium expense without receiving any financial benefit.\nThe board also approved during the meeting a number of technical amendments to existing regulations, many of them relating to the new Office of National Examinations and Supervision, and the transfer of rulemaking authority for many consumer protection laws to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The nation's continually rising unemployment rate underscores the urgent need for states to take full advantage of provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that provide relief for workers facing economic distress, and it calls for making better use of policy solutions designed to help workers through tough economic times, the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) said today. \"Far too many workers and their families are losing jobs and needed income,\" said Evelyn Ganzglass, director of Workforce Development at CLASP. \"It's no secret that mounting job losses have serious economic consequences for workers and their families and for the economy. Workers need swift action from state governments, including implementing recovery act provisions that give more workers access to unemployment insurance and extend unemployment benefits. Furthermore, policymakers at all levels of government must enact long-term solutions that will ensure workers have the skills and supports they need in the future to weather economic downturns.\"\nThe national unemployment rate rose to 8.5 percent in March, the worst since 1983. The rate is even worse for workers without a high school diploma (15.5 percent or 13.3 percent, seasonally adjusted), for African Americans (13.3 percent) and for Latinos (11.4 percent). A fuller measure of under- and unemployment rose to 15.6 percent. This includes groups such as discouraged workers who have given up looking for jobs and those who are working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment.\nWhile the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act temporarily increased unemployment benefits and extended benefits for many workers, many states must still adopt laws that extend coverage to more workers to receive full funding under the modernization provisions. Some of the hardest hit states must also modify state laws to qualify for the full extension of benefits for which they are eligible.\nPresident Obama's budget proposal also called for changes to improve the unemployment insurance program and make it more responsive to future downturns.\nFurther, work sharing, an underused Unemployment Insurance provision, could help employers avoid layoffs. Work sharing programs allow employers to temporarily cut costs by reducing the number of regularly scheduled work hours for all employees or for all employees in a unit that is experiencing a decline in demand for goods or services. For example, through work sharing, an employer could reduce hours for all workers by 20 percent instead of laying off 20 percent of its workforce. In a typical state program, employees work four days a week, receive Unemployment Insurance benefits for the fifth day and retain employer-provided health and retirement benefits. Currently, only 17 states have work sharing programs. Workers filing claims through work sharing have increased multi-fold in many of the states that use this program.\n\"During this tough economic time, we need policy solutions that work for workers,\" Ganzglass said. \"Work sharing can help employees keep their jobs and their benefits, and the partial unemployment benefits available under these programs can help offset the loss of wages.\"\nFor more information on work sharing, go to: \nTo view CLASP's summary of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, visit: \nTo view an overview of choices that states can make to improve income support using the TANF and Unemployment Insurance provisions of the Recovery Act, see: \nCLASP develops and advocates for policies at the federal, state and local levels that improve the lives of low-income people.

Sweeney (D-West Deptford) had proposed to accomplish those goals through a constitutional amendment  -  which would evade the looming veto pen of Gov. Chris Christie, but face even more intense opposition from the state's business associations  -  he recently agreed to support the Assembly-approved measure that will be considered in the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee today.Kathleen A. Davis, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Chamber of Commerce Southern New Jersey, said the legislative provision to automatically increase the minimum wage every year according to inflation is \"still very troublesome to us,\" though she said \"having the opportunity to have our thoughts and concerns weighed is certainly a better way to go than a 'yes or no' question going to voters to make this issue part of our constitution.\"\"This is a very complex and far-reaching issue, so I think that going through the legislative process provides more opportunities for input from the business community in terms of what this increase will mean to them, especially to small businesses,\" Davis said.Davis said a January 2012 survey of the chamber's members found the top reason why businesses oppose the measure is the impact it would have on consumer prices, as any increase in labor costs would get passed on to customers and make a company's products and services less competitive.Some business groups have noted that the shore's tourism industry was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy, and argue the minimum wage increase would amount do a double blow, but Samia Bahsoun, a steering committee member at the small business group Main Street Alliance, made the opposite point, saying the extra income in low-wage workers' pockets would translate into new spending and help the economy.\"So the ripple effect of just this additional dollar... would tremendously impact small biz, and we know that we all need it here on the Jersey Shore,\" she said.According to the New Jersey Time to Care Coalition, which supports the bill sponsored by Assembly Speaker Sheila Y. Oliver (D-East Orange) and other Assembly members, if the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would currently be more than $10 an hour, compared to the $7.25 an hour rate it is today.Oliver said lawmakers are capable of helping businesses and low-wage workers at the same time.\"We are going to be there for those business owners,\" she said. \"We are going to be promulgating a variety of initiatives to help support them, and I do not believe that in order to support businesses that have been ravaged by Sandy it means that we cannot elevate the minimum wage for low income workers in this state.\"Oliver challenged her fellow legislators to pass the bill, noting that the state has in recent years provided numerous incentives to businesses and arguing \"it is time to turn attention to the people that make business prosperous, and it is the people that work within those businesses.\"To voice its concerns to the Legislature, the chamber has joined a coalition of 11 state business groups led by the New Jersey Business & Industry Association to testify against the bill at today's Senate committee hearing.In her prepared testimony, Stefanie Riehl, NJBIA assistant vice president, said the coalition is especially concerned about the proposed minimum wage increase after witnessing Hurricane Sandy's impact on businesses, and hearing that \"many of our employers are still focusing on making payroll and how they can make their workers whole following the losses they've incurred.\"\"Thousands of employers have a long and difficult task in rebuilding their businesses and getting people back to work. Just getting back to where they were is going to be hard enough,\" Riehl said in a statement Friday. \"Lawmakers shouldn't raise the bar even higher.\"Contributing: Jared Kaltwasser"

Pat Quinn speaks with reporters Tuesday after pension legislation passed at the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield.By SARA BURNETT - The Associated PressSPRINGFIELD - With the fight over solving Illinois' worst-in-the-nation pension shortfall now headed to the courts, the financially troubled state faces a grim possibility: The plan could be tossed, and Illinois could wind up in an even deeper fiscal hole than the one it's in now.\nLegislative leaders, anticipating a legal challenge from public-employee unions once the landmark bill approved Tuesday is signed, went extra lengths to bolster the law's odds in the courtroom - including an unusual three-page preamble to the legislation in which they lay out their case for cutting worker and retiree benefits.But legal experts say those efforts could mean little in a state that provides some of the country's stronger constitutional protections of pension benefits.They point to Arizona as a possible warning sign. In 2012, a judge there said a law raising the employee contribution to pension benefits was illegal, and ordered the state to repay the money to workers - with interest.Amanda Kass, budget director and pension specialist for the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability in Chicago, predicted Illinois could see a similar outcome.\"The state could owe back a huge sum of money, possibly with interest,\" she said.Recent rulings across the country bring even greater unpredictability to a plan supporters described as crucial to getting Illinois on better financial footing. A bankruptcy judge in Michigan ruled Tuesday that Detroit can cut its pensions despite constitutional protections like Illinois' - a blow to labor unions and their members.Illinois, Michigan and Arizona are among the seven states that have clauses in their state constitutions that protect pension benefits, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The others are Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana and New York.Illinois and New York's protections are considered to the strongest, however, because the language expressly states that it applies to current and future benefits.\"I think they've got a serious problem,\" said Professor Ann Lousin, the Edward T. and Noble W. Lee Chair in Constitutional Law at John Marshall Law School in Chicago, speaking of the legislative leaders who were the political architects of the Illinois measure.Illinois' unfunded pension liability is $100 billion, largely because lawmakers for decades didn't make the state's annual contributions to the funds.The enormous shortfall led major credit rating agencies to downgrade Illinois to the lowest credit rating in the country. Pension payments also grew to consume about one-fifth of the state's general funds budget - siphoning money from education, social services and other areas.\nAfter years of failed negotiations and disagreements with labor unions over how to fix the problem, the Democrat-controlled Illinois General Assembly on Tuesday approved a plan legislative leaders say will save the state $160 billion over the next three decades and fully fund the systems by 2044.It will push back the retirement age for workers ages 45 and younger, on a sliding scale. The annual 3 percent cost-of-living increases for retirees will be replaced with a system that only provides the increases on a portion of benefits, based on how many years a beneficiary was in a job. Some workers will have the option of freezing their pension and starting a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan.Workers will contribute 1 percent less to their own retirement under the plan. Legislative leaders say they included that provision, as well as language that says the retirement systems may sue the state if it doesn't make its annual payments, in hopes of boosting the measure's chances of surviving the unions' anticipated court challenge.The legislation also directs new money into the pension funds.A coalition of labor unions known as We Are One Illinois stated immediately after the bill passed that it will sue if Gov. Pat Quinn signs it, which the Chicago Democrat is expected to do as early as this week.Quinn said he believes the legislation is constitutional and will ultimately be upheld by the Illinois Supreme Court.\"It is necessary for the economic good for the people of our state, and I think the court will see it that way,\" he said.Senate President John Cullerton isn't so confident. Cullerton, also a Chicago Democrat, pushed a plan earlier this year that he negotiated with the unions and that he said was constitutional because it gave workers and retirees a choice in benefits. That measure failed because leaders in the Illinois House said it wouldn't save enough money.Cullerton, a lawyer, voted for the bill that passed Tuesday and lobbied other Senate Democrats to do the same, but said afterward he still believes it has \"serious constitutional issues.\"Ultimately, the measure could be a test case for the state, and any court ruling instructive for crafting future legislation.\"You can't find out about the constitutionality of the bill until it's actually passed,\" Cullerton said."

There is a search for growth strategies that better fit a changing economic, social and environmental reality. Technical paper: Sound Practices in Space Technology Applications for Disaster Risk Reduction and Inclusive and Sustainable Development26 Nov 2013Journals Asia-Pacific is the most disaster-prone region of the world. In recent years, it has faced a series of multiple exogenous shocks that transcend geographical boundaries and endanger our communities. The poor and the vulnerable are the ones most affected. Despite the rapid economic growth in the region, many developing countries are increasingly vulnerable to disasters, and the magnitude and frequency of extreme disasters are estimated to rise due to the effects of climate change. This necessitates building resilience of the region to extreme disasters in multidimensional ways.

        "webpage": "Let's jump off the fiscal cliff\nby John Cassidy\nOctober 15, 2012, 9:30 AM EDT\nShare icons FORTUNE  -  With the election almost upon us, Wall Street is starting to focus on the possibility that, come Jan. 1, 2013, the economy could hurtle over a \"fiscal cliff\" consisting of $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts. It's hard not to be concerned. The Congressional Budget Office and Ben Bernanke have warned that this shock  -  a result of the Bush tax cuts and the Obama payroll tax reductions expiring at the same time that automatic spending cuts are imposed  -  could well plunge the economy into another recession. But before we all panic and agree to another meaningless short-term fix, such as the one that some senators from both parties are reportedly discussing, let's consider another possibility. Crazy as it might sound, the expiration of the tax cuts could turn out to be a blessing in disguise.\nFor years, Democrats and Republicans have been arguing about how to reduce the enormous budget deficits that have emerged partly as a consequence of the Great Recession. Over the next decade, both sides agree, we need about $4 trillion to $5 trillion in spending cuts and revenue increases. But nobody can agree on how to do the split  -  particularly how to raise federal revenue, now less than 16% of GDP, the lowest level since the early 1950s. President Obama and the Democrats refuse to consider tax hikes on anybody earning less than $250,000 a year. Republicans in Congress refuse to countenance any hikes at all.\nMORE: PIMCO's El-Erian: We're very worried about the fiscal cliff\nAllowing the tax cuts to expire on schedule potentially provides a way out of the impasse. According to Bill Gale of the Brookings Institution, who supports the idea, it would raise about $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years  -  more than enough to help bring down the deficit and stabilize the ratio of federal debt to GDP, a key indicator of long-term financial stability. \"Going over the cliff is the only way to get the economy on a good long-term budget path with a deficit-reduction package that balances revenue increases and spending cuts,\" Gale wrote in a recent article for the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Another cool thing about Gale's approach: It wouldn't require a single vote on Capitol Hill. If the lame-duck Congress does nothing at all when it meets after the election, the tax increases and spending cuts will go into effect on Jan. 1  -  and the threat of the U.S. eventually encountering a Europe-style debt crisis will be greatly reduced.\nNow, as Milton Friedman taught us, there's no such thing as a free lunch. With the introduction of tax hikes and spending cuts, the threat of another recession early in 2013 would be very real. According to the CBO, the economy would contract at an annual rate of 1.3% in the first six months of next year. If Americans decide that the folks in Washington have lost it, and the markets panic, the outcome could be even worse. But there could also be a much better outcome. The next administration  -  a reelected Obama administration, presumably  -  could explain that it was merely reversing a set of policies that has put the U.S. on the road to ruin. Wall Street would be receptive. And  -  this is key  -  the administration could propose another short-term stimulus package to offset some of the hit to demand. Come late January, when the next Congress arrives in Washington, Democrats would be looking to roll back the tax hikes on the poor, and Republicans would be seeking to reverse higher levies on dividends and capital gains. Some targeted spending increases could also be discussed. In a debate about cutting taxes rather than raising them, a compromise would be likely, allowing a stimulus bill to be passed.\nAdmittedly, the idea of increasing taxes at the end of December only to cut them again in February or March takes a bit of getting used to. But as long as the new stimulus is relatively modest and temporary, it would all make perfect sense. The long-term fiscal outlook would be transformed, and the threat of a recession would be greatly reduced. In a dysfunctional political system such as ours, it sometimes takes unorthodox tactics to get important things done. This is one of those times.

This is embodied by the notion of \"no taxation without representation\". In a parliamentary democracy therefore, the Government must, of necessity, seek the approval of Parliament for its yearly expenditure.\nWithout winning the necessary votes of appropriation for its various ministries, the Government cannot move on. In such a scenario, the Prime Minister would have to dissolve Parliament.\nIt may be argued that in this particular Budget, the Government has taken the unusual step of not merely providing financial estimates for fiscal year 2013 but of also proposing to bind legislatures to come in certain future fiscal commitments.\nThe question therefore arises: is this ethically correct?\nFrom the Budget speech we learned that the Government is proposing to reduce the maximum rate of taxation. So far so good. The problem arises when we consider the fact that the Government is envisaging this reform to be carried out over a period of three years.\nIt is being proposed that for the basic year 2013, the maximum tax rate for those earning less than \u20ac60,000 shall be reduced to 32 per cent from 35 per cent. For the year 2014 it shall be reduced to 29 per cent, and for the basic year of 2015, to 25 per cent. Undoubtedly, this appears to be binding prospective legislatures to adopt fiscal measures in the future.\nIn truth, this issue is mainly political but it could also have legal ramifications. In the US, for example, the courts have long held that Congress cannot bind future Congresses, meaning that it cannot force a future session of Congress to carry on its own policies.\nThis is a practice known as \"legislative entrenchment\".\nSome political observers view it as privileging one group of lawmakers over another, binding the future to the priorities set in the present.\nIn this respect, it is worth quoting the well-known British jurist William Blackstone when he states: \"The legislature, being in truth the sovereign power, is always of equal, always of absolute authority; it acknowledges no superior upon earth, which the prior legislature must have been, if its ordinances could bind the present Parliament.\"\nOn the other hand, the only accepted way for Parliament to bind other legislatures and perpetuate a particular bit of legislation is obviously by implementing a constitutional amendment.\nRarely, if ever, has such a practice been adopted with regard to fiscal matters, since these are normally left to be dealt with according to the exigencies of the moment. It is interesting to note, however, that as of late, this practice has been carried out in Malta.\nSuch an amendment was necessitated on account of Malta's European stability mechanism obligations. A Bill was presented earlier this year aimed at entrenching in the Constitution the balanced budget rule, which seeks to reinforce stability, as a response to the sovereign debt crisis currently being experienced by the European Union.\nThis, however, is a measure being taken in extemis and, after all, has the approval of both sides of the House. On the other hand, when we speak of normal budgetary measures and estimates, we should understand that these should reflect the Government's projections for the particular basic year.\nThe reason for all this is that any Parliament forced to carry out the desires of a previous Parliament has less flexibility to respond to any eventual crises.\nTo my mind, both the format and the substance of this present Budget reflect an election Budget, aimed at appeasing the general resentment, even if by unconventional means.\nJose Herrera is Labour spokesman for Justice.\nMaximum income tax rate to be reduced Budget due on Nov. 9 Budget deficits and the Constitution Government is forgetting economic growth...

But the sweeping privatization process is behind schedule. In addition, European governments are nervous that Chinese, Russian and Arab companies are lining up to take advantage of the Greek fire sale.\nThe website of the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund, the agency handling privatization, is filled with cheery slogans promoting Greece as an El Dorado for investors, rich in natural resources such as bauxite, marble and gold, as well as gourmet food.\nBut the International Monetary Fund was disappointed in its latest report, warning Athens that the asset development fund's managers might have to be replaced with foreign experts. In 2012, the agency completed only two sales worth $260 million  -  compared with a target of $4.16 billion.\nNumerous independent analysts share the IMF's view.\n\"The projects are simply not well prepared,\" says Philip Ammerman, an investment consultant and co-founder of London-based Navigator Consulting Group.\n\"What we see coming out of the various government ministries or the office of the prime minister is simply not up to par on any international standards,\" he says. \"The project concepts don't exist, the numbers don't stand up, there are no numbers supporting the project concept, and there is just too much ideology.\"\nDaunting Domestic Obstacles\nGreece has a long tradition of political party interference in state-owned companies; there is still an entrenched reluctance to give up total control over the state's assets. But Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is urging the privatization agency to hurry up.\nAdonis Georgiades, a lawmaker in Samaras' conservative party, says he believes the state should not own anything.\n\"I would sell everything,\" Georgiades says. \"This is the private economy. This is the 21st century. Communism is dead.\"\nThe list of what's up for sale is long: banks, utilities, the national lottery, ports, airports, motorways and other infrastructure. But the vast bulk is real estate, including prime beachfront land.\nThere are many interested buyers, but obstacles to closing deals are daunting. There are hardly any property registries, so land ownership is difficult to determine. In many places, public land is filled with illegal buildings, which require a long legal process to remove.\nMost of all, Greek citizens  -  already paying a high price for draconian austerity measures  -  don't like privatization.\nFor 30 years, Dimetra Columbani has managed a branch of OPAP, the Greek national lottery, perhaps the most profitable state asset.\n\"I'm very worried. I have no idea what's going to happen, who is going to buy the lottery company, and how it will be operated,\" Columbani says. \"I cannot risk losing everything I've invested here if a new company takes over.\"\nPolls show that a majority of Greeks fear the country's assets are being sold off for too little, and many see privatization as an international takeover.\nGeopolitical Issues Cause Delays\nEuropean governments, as well as Washington, are reportedly concerned over Russia's possible expansion into Europe. Gazprom, Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, has made a high bid for the Greek gas utility company. Media reports suggest the privatization agency has delayed choosing a buyer  -  under international pressure.\nThere are also other strategic concerns, such as conflict with China over Greek ports.\nGeorge Stathakis, an economist and lawmaker for the opposition leftist party Syriza, says China wants to expand its current control of a part of the Port of Piraeus and also buy the south-north railway link, raising fears China will flood the European markets with its inexpensive products.\n\"German and Dutch interests are opposing the idea of using Greece as the primary source of Chinese trade with Europe,\" Stathakis says.\nThe original IMF privatization target had been 50 billion euros by 2015, but it has already been sharply reduced to 10 billion. Stathakis says he believes it will be cut back even more.\nKeywords: EuropePrevious\u2039Obama's Pick For CIA Chief To Face Senate ScrutinyNext\nSilica Rule Changes Delayed While Workers Face Health Risks\u203a Support for NEPR.net is provided  a NEPR Underwriter"

According to the BMO Psychology of Investing Report - the second in a series of reports that examine the mindset of Canadians when dealing with personal finances - two in five Canadians (40 per cent) say that emotions play a role in their investing decisions. The report, produced by Pollara, also revealed the following:\nNearly 60 per cent of Canadians say they have invested on impulse at least once.\nTwo-thirds report they have not been in total control of their emotions when investing.\nAnticipation, trust and fear are the most intense emotions that Canadians feel when deciding how to invest.\nOnly 16 per cent are very familiar with the actual investments they hold in their portfolios.\n\"While we're only human, wise investing means more than simply following your heart,\" said Serge P\u00e9pin, Vice President, Investment Strategy, BMO Asset Management Inc. \"It's critical not only to take the time to understand the market environment before making any financial moves, but also to ensure you're in the right frame of mind to make such decisions.\" Mr. P\u00e9pin added that reading the business pages of newspapers and magazines, doing research online and seeking advice from financial professionals can help to ensure an informed investment decision-making process.\nCanadians Lack Confidence When Investing\nThe report also found that many Canadians are unaware of how to make an investment and lack the confidence to do so. Additionally, many are not even sure of their current holdings. Forty-four per cent of Canadians say that they are not confident when investing.\nOnly one-quarter do careful and extensive research before making investment decisions.\nMore than one-third (35 per cent) are not familiar with the companies in which they have invested. Do Canadians Feel They Are Investing Enough? Forty-one per cent of Canadian investors do not believe they are investing enough. The top barriers indentified include:\nThe vast majority (90 per cent) feel they have not saved enough to warrant investing.\nEighty-three per cent want to pay off their debt before investing.\nIn addition, fear of losing what they invest (79 per cent), feeling that investing is too complicated (76 per cent) and not knowing who to turn to for advice (64 per cent) were all identified as barriers. \"These barriers are completely understandable,\" said Mr. P\u00e9pin. \"For Canadians who are unsure about investing, a good first step is to meet with a financial professional. Such a professional can help identify your investing goals and the funds you have available, and then work with you to develop a financial plan that can help you invest for life's key milestones - such as parenthood, the purchase of a home and retirement.\"\nAs part of its ongoing commitment to 'Making Money Make Sense,' BMO has introduced various tools to help Canadians stay on top of their personal finances, including BMO by Appointment, BMO MoneyLogic, BMO SmartSteps, BMO SmartSteps for Parents and BMO SmartSteps for Business.

        "webpage": "/ It Didn't Have to Be This Way\nIt Didn't Have to Be This Way\nWhy Boom and Bust Is Unnecessary - and How the Austrian School of Economics Breaks the Cycle\nWritten by Harry C. Veryser\n\"Excellent . . . I highly recommend this book.\"  - RON PAUL\nWhy is the boom-and-bust cycle so persistent? Why did economists fail to predict the economic meltdown that began in 2007 - or to pull us out of the crisis more quickly? And how can we prevent future calamities?\nMainstream economics has no adequate answers for these pressing questions. To understand how we got here, and how we can ensure prosperity, we must turn to an alternative to the dominant approach: the Austrian School of economics. Unfortunately, few people have even a vague understanding of the Austrian School, despite the prominence of leading figures such as Nobel Prize winner F. A. Hayek, author of The Road to Serfdom. Harry C. Veryser corrects that problem in this powerful and eye-opening book. In presenting the Austrian School's perspective, he reveals why the boom-and-bust cycle is unnatural and unnecessary. Veryser tells the fascinating (but frightening) story of how our modern economic condition developed. The most recent recession, far from being an isolated incident, was part of a larger cycle that has been the scourge of the West for a century - a cycle rooted in government manipulation of markets and currency. The lesson is clear: the devastation of the recent economic crisis - and of stagflation in the 1970s, and of the Great Depression in the 1930s - could have been avoided. It didn't have to be this way. Economics is not a mysterious science, Veryser shows. As the Austrian School teaches, it is simply the study of human action. Mainstream economics has failed because it has forgotten this fundamental truth. Economists have tried to put economics on a par with hard sciences like physics, reducing everything to numbers. But their complex mathematical models and cherished theories have only contributed to economic collapse.\nAs the debate rages over the role of government in the economy, Harry Veryser presents the proper alternative to government interventionist approaches that have proved so ineffective. Too long unappreciated, the Austrian School of economics reveals the crucial conditions for a successful economy and points the way to a free, prosperous, and humane society. Additional Information\n\"Harry Veryser provides an excellent introduction to the Austrian School of economics and an excellent account of the economic history of the twentieth century, chronicling the rise, fall, and (hopefully) rebirth of classical liberalism or libertarianism. I highly recommend this book to the growing number of Americans interested in learning more about sound economics.\" - RON PAUL,, bestselling author of End the Fed and Liberty Defined\"I am blown away by how much ground Harry Veryser covers in this important book, and how skillfully he covers it. This book will give you a quick yet solid grounding in the recent financial crisis, U.S. and world economic history, the history of economic thought, and more. I strongly recommend it.\" - THOMAS E. WOODS JR.,, bestselling author of Meltdown, senior fellow of the Ludwig von Mises Institute\"Too much of mainstream economics is rooted in dubious presumptions and outright error; at the same time it's adorned with equations that provide a thin veneer of mathematical precision. If the insights of the Austrian School had come to dominate the profession in the past century as I expect they will in the future, many calamities could have been avoided. Harry Veryser has given us a book that not only tells all of us what we need to learn but also provides economists with truths they should never have forgotten.\" - LAWRENCE W. REED,, president of the Foundation for Economic Education\"Harry Veryser has written an excellent book not only on Austrian economics but also on a century and a half of economic history. His is a penetrating analysis of the most recent economic crisis. Professor Veryser's careful analysis of the case for the gold standard is, in itself, outstanding scholarship.\" - LEWIS E. LEHRMAN,, cofounder of the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, author of The True Gold Standard\"Professor Harry Veryser is in the forefront of teaching sound economics in the tradition of the Austrian School. In this much-anticipated book, he powerfully demonstrates how much further advanced the United States and the world would be if our leaders had followed the grand principles of sound money and free markets.

        "webpage": "Investors looking to long-term promise of Vietnam\nAFP, HANOI\nMon, Apr 25, 2011 - Page 11\nDespite Vietnam's persistent economic woes, a record deal this month has shown foreign investors are still lured to the frontier market by its young, growing population and rising disposable incomes.The sealing of the communist country's largest-ever private equity deal, at a time of soaring inflation and a struggling currency, has underscored faith in Vietnam's long-term potential, beyond its current macro instabilities.US-based investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co (KKR) is to pay US$159 million for a 10 percent stake in Masan Consumer Corp, the leading fish sauce producer in Vietnam, the companies announced on April 13.\"KKR is bullish on Vietnam,\" KKR spokesman Ming Lu said. \"In the past decade, there has been considerable economic progress, structural reforms and a notable increase in living standards.\"With annual GDP growth averaging 7.1 percent from 1990 to 2009, Vietnam's 87 million people  -  about half of them under 30  -  are now a \"ferocious\" consumer force, according to Adam Sitkoff of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi.\"Now I walk around seeing a 10-year-old Vietnamese with an iPod and a Gucci hat  -  it still shocks me,\" he said, adding that decades of limited choice, poor quality and high prices had generated pent-up demand.Boutique shops, BlackBerry smartphones and BMWs are almost as common as the red banners, army uniforms and loudspeakers that dot the capital Hanoi's streets  -  symbols of the socialist regime still dominating the political landscape.However, rapid expansion since the early 1990s  -  after the country began to turn away from a planned economy to embrace the free market  -  has come at a cost to Vietnam, once celebrated as a new \"Asian Tiger.\"Relative to other members of ASEAN such as Singapore or Malaysia, Vietnam has struggled to keep up with its own expansion, Marc Mealy of the US-ASEAN Business Council said.\"In Vietnam's case, the pace of liberalization to global capital has in some ways outpaced the development of their institutions and human resources to manage their macroeconomy,\" he said.The hurdles are formidable and persistent: inflation that hit nearly 14 percent year-on-year last month, a trade deficit of an estimated US$12.4 billion last year and a weak currency, the dong, devalued four times since late 2009.Corruption and wasteful bureaucracy have also damaged Vietnam's global financial reputation, with the credit worthiness of state-owned enterprises further threatened by the near-bankruptcy of shipbuilder Vinashin.Economic stabilization, rather than growth, has subsequently become the government's main focus, with the Communist Party announcing an overhaul of its business growth model during a five-year congress in January.While analysts have welcomed the moves, global credit ratings agency Moody's upheld a negative outlook for Vietnam in a report issued on Wednesday.This \"reflects concerns about the sustainability of the country's balance of payments despite the government's recent macro--stabilization measures,\" the report said.Moody's analyst Christian de Guzman said the country was \"fraught with risks\" for foreign portfolio investors considering buying Vietnamese stocks or bonds, and interest had \"dried up.\"However, he said long-term foreign direct investment (FDI) was \"still very healthy and coming through at a steady pace.\"Government figures show disbursed FDI into Vietnam totaled US$2.54 billion in the first quarter of this year, up 1.6 percent from the same period last year.Such long-term investors \"believe in the strong underlying potential and believe the current macroeconomic factors to be transitory,\" economist Dariusz Kowalczyk at Credit Agricole CIB said.One key attraction is lower labor costs, encouraging foreign manufacturers to relocate from China to Vietnam, or to use it in a \"China plus one\" strategy of adding a second production base outside the Asian giant.\"Vietnam has very strong growth potential because of the entrepreneurship of the population,\" Kowalczyk added. \"People seem to be really driven to improve their lives.\""

        "webpage": "Advocates Renew Push to Keep Unemployment Benefits\nBy Eliza Newlin Carney\nAs the deadline for avoiding the fiscal cliff draws ever nearer, advocates for out-of-work Americans have redoubled their push to make sure unemployment benefits don't expire for 2 million workers Dec. 29.\nThe campaign is the centerpiece of a multi-part agenda that the National Employment Law Project, which advocates on behalf of low-income and unemployed workers, released Wednesday. The group's 100-day policy agenda for Congress and the Obama administration also includes establishing federal minimum wage and overtime standards for home health care workers, investing $250 billion annually in infrastructure projects over five years, strengthening worker health and safety protections and raising the minimum wage for all workers.\nWhile some items, such as a minimum wage hike, would face stiff GOP resistance on Capitol Hill, others may soon prove within reach. These include extending soon-to-expire unemployment benefits for one year, which is front and center on NELP's agenda. The group is spearheading a lobbying campaign to extend the benefits with a coalition of progressive organizations, from labor to women's and religious groups.\nWith the help of allied organizations, NELP has collected almost 60,000 signatures on a petition calling on Congress to extend the unemployment insurance benefits, which now go to some 2.1 million Americans who have been out of work six months or longer. The program, which costs about $30 billion a year, ensures that the long-term unemployed receive benefits for up to 47 additional weeks if they still can't find work after they have received six months of state benefits. Unemployed workers told their stories at a Capitol Hill press conference Tuesday with 10 congressional Democrats, including Reps. Sander M. Levin of Michigan, Lloyd Doggett, of Texas and Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Also in attendance were organizers with the Philadelphia Unemployment Project, which brought 50 unemployed workers to the event, who then fanned out for visits with key lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\"We will not leave here without extending federal unemployment insurance,\" Levin said in a statement. \"There's a cliff facing two million Americans who were laid off through no fault of their own, and it is vital that we ensure that they have the assistance they need next year as they look for work.\"\nThough Speaker John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, has been mum on the issue of unemployment benefits during his negotiations with President Barack Obama, NELP organizers actually regard his silence as a good sign and say they are confident an extension would be included in any final \"cliff\" deal.\nIf negotiators at the White House and Capitol Hill cannot come up with a budget agreement, automatic spending cuts and tax increases will take effect automatically at the end of the year. Levin has said Obama favors extending unemployment benefits as part of a budget plan.\n\"There is really no disagreement about the need for the continuation of the program,\" said Judy Conti, NELP's federal advocacy coordinator. \"It's just more about making sure that it doesn't get lost in the shuffle.\"\nConti noted that the political dynamics of the unemployment debate have shifted, with even the conservative Heritage Foundation endorsing some form of an extension. There are \"valid humanitarian reasons to extend benefits in a recession,\" wrote Heritage senior policy analyst James Sherk in an issue brief earlier this year, though he argued benefits should be extended for a shorter period and to workers who had been out of work for closer to a year rather than six months.\nThe real danger for advocates of unemployed and low-income workers, Conti said, is that Obama and Boehner fail to reach an agreement, in which case unemployment benefits would expire automatically. Since it is the middle of winter, Conti said, even losing the benefits for a few weeks would represent a hardship for families who have already exhausted their reserves.\n\"There is an actual cliff for these workers,\" she said. \"If the program isn't reauthorized after that, all 2.1 million people who are receiving benefits will be immediately cut off.\""

        "webpage": "News & EventsNews Archive2012December 2012\nPrint Email Dec\nPosted: 10:36 GMT\n\"Older people's finances are not regarded as a problem, but look deeper and genuine hardship is there\"\nA new report suggests that many older people are experiencing real hardship during Ireland's recession, but that this remains largely hidden from public view. This suggests caution is necessary when interpreting official statistics, which show deprivation and poverty rates for pensioner households to be at an all-time low. The NUI Galway research report'Deprivation and its Measurement in Later Life' was undertaken by the University's Irish Centre for Social Gerontology. It was funded through the Irish Research Council with support from the Department of Social Protection.\nLed by Professor Thomas Scharf, Director of the Irish Centre for Social Gerontology at NUI Galway, the research tries to understand how older people respond to the 11-item basic deprivation index used in official poverty statistics.\nRe-analysis of available national data shows that measured deprivation depends in large part on the choice of indicators used. Some indicators used in official measures are less relevant to older people than other population groups. This was reinforced in focus groups and interviews with a diverse sample of older people. As a result, older people are less likely to be identified as deprived.\nIn launching the report, Professor Scharf said: \"Older people's finances are not regarded as a problem, but look deeper and genuine hardship is there. Our research suggests that older people respond differently to standard deprivation measures than other population groups. This means that reported levels of deprivation may under-estimate the actual experience of poverty and deprivation amongst older people.\" Professor Scharf feels that a new, stand-alone deprivation index for older people is needed for use in official statistics.\nMany research participants held a relatively narrow view of poverty, linking this to an inability to afford basic household items. Participants were generally more likely to identify as necessities items relating to housing and accommodation, food and food quality, household bills and clothing. By contrast, taking a holiday away from home or being able to afford to replace worn-out furniture were less likely to be regarded as essential.\nThe research shows that poverty and deprivation continue to affect the lives of many older people in Ireland. While the value of state pensions has been maintained, a number of people who took part in the research were struggling to cope with the loss of other forms of support at a time when additional demands were being placed on their finances. In particular, providing financial support to adult children and grandchildren during the recession featured in several participants' accounts.\nWelcoming the research, Robin Webster, CEO of Age Action Ireland, congratulated the Irish Centre for Social Gerontology on producing this timely report that gives a greater insight into the nature of deprivation as experienced by many older people in maintaining their quality of life in the face of rising costs and reduced support services. He also welcomed the proposal to have a new deprivation index for older people.\nMarketing and Communications Office"

This is the main discovery of an international scientific study, in which the Universidad Carlos III of Madrid has participated, which reveals how to predict people's shopping patterns. This research study attempts to identify just how predictable we consumers are with respect to shopping patterns. As explained by one of its authors, Esteban Moro of the Department of Mathematics at UC3M, \"the main conclusion we have drawn is that people's behavior is repetitive when it comes to visiting and spending in shops, and as such it is possible to have some success in predicting where we are going to buy in the future\". Published in Scientific Reports, the open journal of the Nature group, the study was also produced by scientists from the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, the University of California in San Diego (U.S.A), M.I.T (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and NICTA (Australia).\nIn order to carry out the study, researchers analyzed hundreds of thousands of de-identified economic transactions made with credit cards on both sides of the Atlantic. The goal was to find the 'predictability' of the time series of consumption in almost a year's worth of credit card purchases made by more than 50 million accounts. \"What we found\"- the researcher points out- \"is that people are quite regular when visiting (and purchasing in shops and that there is quite a bit of 'predictability', above all in the long term\". To put it another way, it is difficult to predict where your next purchase will be on the basis of where you are doing your shopping now. However, as Professor Moro indicates, it is possible to know with a fair degree of probability where you will go shopping during the next month. In short: we go back to the same shops with remarkable regularity.\nAs pointed out by the researchers, the study has various applications that range from geomarketing (marketing in specific areas of the city), provision of points of sale, locating cash tellers or detecting fraud. There is still not enough information available to the researchers as to whether this data can be extrapolated to cash operations.\nOver the past few years there has been a good deal of research on the 'predictability' of social behavior. By using different data sources (telephones, Wi-Fi points, GPS data, etc.), many groups of scientists have studied how predictable our mobility is- that is, the routes, walks and places that we use to move about in the city.\nWhile this mobility is determined by the tasks we have to carry out throughout the day (going to work, going home, etc.), there are also many variables throughout the day that are not completely predictable (where to, take out money, etc.). As Esteban Moro puts it, \"our goal was to try to observe to what extent this 'predictability' also exists in economic decisions (how much and where I use the credit card). Although they are conditioned by our daily mobility, these decisions have a completely different dimension.\" More information: The predictability of consumer visitation patterns, Coco Krumme, Alejandro Llorente, Manuel Cebrian Alex Pentland, Esteban Moro, Scientific Reports.

Having described the Maastricht Treaty as 'an interim step, albeit an important one on the road to European Union,' he continued, 'The parts of the treaty dealing with political union are just as important as those concerning economic and monetary union. Everyone in Europe must realise that we can preserve all our economic achievements only if we also secure them politically. An economic union will survive only if it is based on a political union.'At the press conference following Central Bank Council Session of the Bundesbank on 20th April, 1995, the Bundesbank's president, Dr. Hans Tietmeyer, observed that 'a currency union is in the long term an irrevocable community of solidarity. Every experience shows that it needs a continuing commitment in the form of a comprehensive political union for its survival. By 1999 Chancellor Schroder was even clearer when he spoke at The Hague on 19th January: 'The introduction of the euro is probably the most important integrating step since the beginning of the unification process. It is certain that the times of individual national efforts regarding employment policies, social and tax policies are definitely over.' 'The internal market and the common currency demand joint co-ordinating action. This will require to bury finally some erroneous ideas of national sovereignty.'\n\nHere is Tebbit's take on why the the euro plan was launched ins spite of the knowledge that it would probably lead to a crisis:\n\nIf it was so obvious that without enforced convergence by the establishment of political union and a single euro treasury with tax powers it would be in danger of failure, why did the creation of the euro go ahead? The answer, I fear, is that the elite of Brussels saw it as a way of enforcing economic and political union. They knew the crisis would come and they intended to use it to grab power from the member states. Instead of resisting such a plan, our political leaders here (and some elsewhere) put their fingers in their ears, closed their eyes and buried their heads in the sand. They must have, or ought to have, known that the leaders of the euro project saw it as a way of enforcing fiscal and political union, that is the creation of the European Republic. They must have, or ought to have, known that a crisis would arise for the euro which would lead either to its collapse or to the ceding to Brussels of economic and tax powers."

        "webpage": "Bill to lower student loan rates heads to Obama\nBy PHILIP ELLIOTT (AP) WASHINGTON - A bipartisan bill that would lower the costs of borrowing for millions of students is awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. The House on Wednesday gave final congressional approval to legislation that links student loan interest rates to the financial markets. The bill would offer lower rates for most students now but higher rates down the line if the economy improves as expected. For the moment, the focus was on the class of students signing loans for classes this fall. \"Going forward, the whims of Washington politicians won't dictate student loan interest rates, meaning more certainty and more opportunities for students to take advantage of lower rates,\" House Speaker John Boehner said. The measure passed 392-31. Undergraduates this fall would borrow at a 3.9 percent interest rate for subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans. Graduate students would have access to loans at 5.4 percent, and parents would borrow at 6.4 percent. The rates would be locked in for that year's loan, but each year's loan could be more expensive than the last. Rates would rise as the economy picks up and it becomes more expensive for the government to borrow money. But for now, interest payments for tuition, housing and books would be less expensive under the House-passed bill. \"Changing the status quo is never easy, and returning student loan interest rates to the market is a longstanding goal Republicans have been working toward for years,\" said Rep. John Kline, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. \"I applaud my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for finally recognizing this long-term, market-based proposal for what it is: a win for students and taxpayers.\" The House earlier this year passed legislation that is similar to what the Senate later passed. Both versions link interest rates to 10-year Treasury notes and remove Congress' annual role in determining rates. \"Campaign promises and political posturing should not play a role in the setting of student loan interest rates,\" said Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. \"Borrowers deserve better.\" Negotiators of the Senate compromise were mindful of the House-passed version, as well as the White House preference to shift responsibility for interest rates to the financial markets. The resulting bipartisan bill passed the Senate 81-18. With changes made in the Senate _ most notably a cap on how interest rates could climb and locking in interest rates for the life of each year's loan _ Democrats dropped their objections and joined Republicans in backing the bill. Interest rates would not top 8.25 percent for undergraduates. Graduate students would not pay rates higher than 9.5 percent, and parents' rates would top out at 10.5 percent. Using Congressional Budget Office estimates, rates would not reach those limits in the next 10 years. Rates on new subsidized Stafford loans doubled to 6.8 percent July 1 because Congress could not agree on a way to keep them at 3.4 percent. Without congressional action, rates would have stayed at 6.8 percent _ a reality most lawmakers called unacceptable. The compromise that came together during the last month would be a good deal for all students through the 2015 academic year. After that, interest rates are expected to climb above where they were when students left campus in the spring, if congressional estimates prove correct. The White House and its allies said the new loan structure would offer lower rates to 11 million borrowers right away and save the average undergraduate $1,500 in interest charges. In all, some 18 million loans will be covered by the legislation, totaling about $106 billion this fall. Lawmakers were already talking about changing the deal when they take up a rewrite of the Higher Education Act this fall. As a condition of his support, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, won a Government Accountability Office report on the costs of colleges. That document was expected to guide an overhaul of the deal just negotiated. ___ Follow Philip Elliott on Twitter:  (Copyright 2013 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)"

PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.\nOn July 7, 2000, the Executive Board concluded the Article IV consultation with Chile.1\nChile's overall economic performance during 1990-97 was very strong. Real GDP grew at an annual average rate of 7.7 percent, inflation declined gradually from 26 percent to 6 percent, and social indicators improved significantly. This performance was based on important structural reforms, strong banking supervision, an open trade regime, and prudent macroeconomic policies. During this period, the authorities targeted a declining year-end inflation rate, adjusted short-term interest rates to achieve that objective, and maintained strong public sector finances; they also managed the exchange rate within a sliding band and administered a set of controls on capital flows. By early 1998, Chile faced the difficult combination of a widening external current account deficit and a slowdown of capital inflows. The authorities scaled back expenditure plans, and tightened monetary policy strongly to prevent a large depreciation of the currency. In the event domestic demand fell sharply and the current account deficit started to narrow. However, from late 1998 through most of 1999, Chile experienced declining output and rising unemployment.\nIn 1999, as the size of the drop in demand became apparent, the authorities responded with expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. These policies, helped by an improving external environment, succeeded in initiating a recovery of output and employment in the latter part of the year. For 1999 as a whole, however, real GDP declined by about 1 percent, and inflation dropped to 2.3 percent by year-end. The current account deficit shrank from 5.7 percent of GDP in 1998 to near-zero in 1999, reflecting cyclically weak domestic demand, but also supported by a real depreciation of the currency and strong export volume growth. With moderate net capital outflows and some negative valuation effects, the stock of international reserves declined by about 8 percent during the year, but at end-1999 still remained at a comfortable level of more than three times the estimated level of short-term debt on a residual maturity basis (excluding trade credits).\nThe economic recovery that began in late"

And as Nash alludes to, we must understand and observe the entire known history of money in order to truly understand what money is. Today we as a society seem to have developed a cognitive bias towards money that we each share to varying degrees.

It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for \"all debts, public and private\".[6] Such laws in practice cause fiat money to acquire the value of any of the goods and services that it may be traded for within the nation that issues it.\n\nIn his essay \"Shelling Out\" Nick Szabo extends the works of Adam Smith and especially in relation to ancient man through an interesting conjecture about the Kula Ring peoples. The Kula Ring conjecture is an important foundational understanding for the advent and ultimate academic acceptance of bitcoin, which might someday soon become to be commonly known as an evolution of money.\n\nIdeal Money in regard to the Nashian lectures on the subject, refers to the difference between good and bad money in the Gresham's sense. Gresham's law states that bad money drives out the good:\n\n\"Good\" money is money that shows little difference between its nominal value (the face value of the coin) and its commodity value (the value of the metal of which it is made, often precious metals, nickel, or copper).\n\nFiat money today tends to be money of obviously poor quality in relation to what might be perceived as Ideal Money or Good money. Currency is also helpful to define in relation to this:\nA currency (from Middle English: curraunt, \"in circulation\", from Latin: currens, -entis) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins.[1][2] A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation.[3]\n\nNick Szabo further defines or understanding of money and its history and possible future as an extrapolation from the past:\n\nMany polymaths right up to the ancients and most ancient written historical accounts include peoples that had significant impacts on economics, foreign commerce and trade deals, and the quality of money used in their respective regions and times. Newton, Copernicus, Nash are examples of peoples that have had great effects on the economies of their time."

The average EUC check is $377 a month and will shrink by about $47.\nWoonsocket beneficiaries will probably see somewhat smaller cuts, said DLT spokeswoman Laura Hart. But it's because their checks are generally smaller to begin with, as the city's median income is lower than the statewide median.\n\"I think the good folks of Woonsocket have been hit harder by the recession than the state on a whole,\" said Hart. \"We've seen it in Pawtucket and Providence, too.\"\nBen Lessing, the executive director of Family Resources Community Action Program, says the cuts are going to be a major setback for individuals struggling to get by now.\n\"It's going to send more people into poverty,\" said Lessing. \"We're going to see more customers at our Family Support Center looking for assistance with food, utilities, housing. We're going to see more people who are at risk of homelessness. And it wasn't that long ago that many of these people were gainfully employed.\"\nCiting the effects of federal sequestration, the DLT announced weeks ago that weekly benefits for the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program would be reduced by 12.2 percent, starting April 21. The cuts won't show up in beneficiaries' paychecks until a week after claimants accrue the benefit, or April 28.\nThe program offers a federal extension of the state's unemployment program, which that maxes out at 26 weeks. EUC provides an additional 47 weeks - nearly a full year - of unemployment benefits.\nA total of 8,000 claimants in Rhode Island will be affected in Rhode Island, but the statistics suggest Woonsocket will be hit especially hard.\nWhile the state continues to have one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation - 9.8 percent - Woonsocket has one of the highest unemployment rates within the state, about 11.5 percent, according to the DLT.\nEUC has helped buoy thousands of Rhode Island residents economically during a period when the economy isn't creating many new jobs, but the program could disappear at the end of December, according to Hart.\n\"In fact it was slated to go away last December as well, but it was resurrected, and that could happen again,\" she said.\nThe sequester has become the official term to describe a series of small budget cuts to a wide range of programs set to take effect automatically, in a deal reached between Congress and President Barack Obama more than a year ago. They are kicking in now, after Congress and the President could not agree on an alternative approach to budget-cutting.\nThe White House issued a statement tallying up the cost of the sequester to Rhode Island at more than $40 million, much of it in the form of furloughed military salaries. But other rollbacks would hit social programs that affect children, the elderly and the disabled.\nAmong other things, the White House predicted the sequester would result in cutbacks including:\n\u2022 $2.4 million in funding for primary and secondary education, or enough to pay for about 30 teachers and aides.\n\u2022 The elimination of funding for about 200 seats in the early childhood education program, Head Start.\n\u2022 About $188,000 in funds that provide meals to seniors, including the Meals on Wheels program.\n\u2022 The elimination of about $126,000 for job search and employment training, which means 4,550 fewer people would be served by those programs.\nLessing says he is still keeping an eye on the situation to see how his own agency will be affected. He says he is expecting cuts in the Community Development Block Grant program that are used to provide emergency shelter for the homeless.\nLessing says one of the most troubling aspects of the sequester is that it's not a blanket cut that takes affect all at once. The cuts are phased in gradually, leading many to falsely underestimate their impact over time.\n\"It kind of leads you into a sense of, 'well, it's not that bad,'\" said Lessing. \"What's bad it that is happening on a kind of rolling basis.\""

But he warned that growth won't be strong enough to quickly drive down high unemployment.\n\"Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established,\" he said.\nHis remarks suggest the Fed will stick with its program to prime the economy by purchasing $600 billion of Treasury bonds by the end of June.\nThe Fed chief also issued a stern warning to Congress and the White House to come up with a plan to reduce the government's bloated budget deficits. And he told Congress not to play political games with the Treasury Department's request to boost the government's borrowing authority beyond the current $14.3 trillion statutory cap.\nOn the hiring front, Bernanke said it will take \"several years\" for unemployment to return to more normal levels. Last month, the Fed chief was more specific, saying it would take four or five years for the unemployment rate to drop to a historically normal level of around 5.5 percent or 6 percent.\nThe Fed chief spoke one day before the government releases its employment snapshot for January. Economists believe the unemployment rate ticked up to 9.5 percent last month, from 9.4 percent in December, and employers added a net total of around 146,000 jobs. Job-creation would need to be twice as fast each month to make a noticeable dent in unemployment.\nStill, Bernanke said Thursday's sharp decline in requests for unemployment benefits is encouraging. And he was hopeful that companies will become more willing to hire this year, saying he expected stronger jobs reports \"pretty soon.\"\nDiscussing the nation's fiscal situation, Bernanke warned that the economy could be hurt if Congress and the White House fail to craft a long-term plan to reduce the government's $1 trillion-plus budget deficits.\nPersistent budget deficits will prompt investors to demand more returns on government loans, causing interest rates to soar. Higher borrowing costs would crimp spending by consumers and businesses, slowing economic activity.\n\"If government debt and deficits were actually to grow at the pace envisioned, the economic and financial effect would be severe,\" Bernanke said.\nThe budget deficit has averaged approximately 9 percent of the nation's $14 trillion economy over the past two years. That's up from an average of 2 percent during the three years before the recession, Bernanke said.\nThe Treasury Department has asked Congress to let it borrow more so that it can continue to pay its bills. In the unlikely event that Congress was to deny the request, the U.S. government would be at risk of defaulting on its debt. Bernanke said the implications would be catastrophic. He urged Congress not to use the debt limit issue as a \"bargaining chip\" in broader discussions about how to reduce the government's debt and deficits.\nOn the economy, Bernanke said he expected inflation to be quite low despite a recent increase in commodities prices, such as oil and gasoline. The Fed has said that it believes competitive pressures will prevent companies from passing along all of these higher costs by significantly boosting prices to consumers.\nBernanke wouldn't talk about what economic impact, if any, political upheaval in Egypt would have on the U.S. and the global economy. He attributed the rise in global food and oil prices to strong demand from fast-growing countries like China - not on the Fed's policies to stimulate growth in the United States.\nLast week, Bernanke and his colleagues said the $600 billion bond-purchase program is needed to help the economy grow more strongly and ease unemployment. Low inflation gives the Fed leeway to stay the course.\nA Fed committee headed by vice chair Janet Yellen will soon have recommendations on ways to improve the Fed's communications with the public and investors, Bernanke said.\nOne of the options is for Bernanke to have periodic press conferences. Bernanke said the Fed wants to be more open and do a better job of explaining its policies. At the same time, the Fed doesn't want to unnecessarily rattle financial markets by saying too much or not communicating clearly.\nLawmakers warn administration of cuts in Iraq aid\nAuschwitz decays, prompting preservation effort"

By Mark Trumbull, Staff writer /\nAja Jackson, of Quincy, Mass., cut up her last credit card about two years ago and now only pays using cash and debit. Just as new credit-card laws offer consumers new protections, the recession is causing them to cut back on their use.\nSarah Beth Glicksteen / The Christian Science Monitor / File\nAfter Monday's new credit card laws take effect, card issuers can no longer jack up interest rates on existing balances, for example. But those balances have been plunging over the past year.It's a sign that, although the new law may be a win for consumers, it comes as the amount of credit available appears to be shrinking. \"At some point purse strings will loosen a bit on credit,\" says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks borrowing options for consumers. \"But the qualification standards have changed.\"\nThe tightening of credit is something that typically accompanies recessions, he notes. And a return to some of the lax lending standards that existed before the recession would not be good for borrowers or banks.At the same time, however, the contraction of credit in the past two years has been unusually severe. Many economists say the strength of an economic recovery will depend on how fast credit starts to flow in a normal way. Consider this: Until the past year, the amount of revolving consumer credit (essentially credit cards) has risen for three decades through thick and thin. Even in the recessions of 1981, 1991, and 2001, the trend stayed positive, according to Federal Reserve data plotted by averaging the most recent three months and comparing them to the same period a year earlier. But for the recession that began in 2007, this number has dived below zero into outright decline. The most recent plot on the chart, from Wells Fargo Securities, shows revolving credit declining at nearly a 10 percent annual rate.The decline has several causes. Some borrowers are moving to pare their debt load, while others defaulted on their debt because of a job loss. Banks, facing a surge in delinquent loans, scrambled to reduce their risks by closing down credit accounts or imposing tighter limits on borrowing. Banks also knew that curbs on some of their fee and billing practices - the law that went into effect this week - were on the way. That Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure (CARD) Act is prompting card issuers to rethink their business models, even as they're also dealing with recession-related losses. The law is forcing banks to reduce some fees, but some reports [link to tracey's second piece] show they have begun to boost other fees or add new ones.\"Probably because of the act, they are a little more cautious\" about new card lending, says Yasmine Kamaruddin, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C. About these ads\nAs card issuers have tried to cut exposure to various risks, the number of Visa, MasterCard, and American Express cards in circulation dropped 15 percent in 2009, according to the Associated Press. Banks have also lowered the credit limits for millions of accounts.When will credit conditions improve?Perhaps it will start happening soon. But so far, numbers gathered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. show that banks still confront a worrisome level of bad loans, although the problem may be peaking. In the third quarter of 2009, some 3.4 percent of all credit card loans were \"noncurrent,\" according to the FDIC data. That's much worse than the bad-loan level at the start of 2009 (2.8 percent) or two years before (1.9 percent). But it was better than in the second quarter of last year, when 3.6 percent of credit card loans were noncurrent.\"Stability will go a long way toward freeing up credit,\" says Mr. McBride in North Palm Beach, Fla. \"Stability in terms of the economy, and in loan defaults.\" Follow Stories Like This\nNew credit card laws 2010 still have 'gotchas.'

Another Step in China's Financial Liberalization\nGovernment tries out regulatory changes within Shanghai Free Trade Zone.\nBy Susan Kelly May 7, 2014 \u2022 Reprints\nChina took another step toward liberalizing its financial regulations last fall by establishing the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, which now serves as a laboratory for trying out new rules and regulations for doing business in China.\nChinese regulators have proposed regulatory changes within the zone affecting everything from the interest rate paid on deposits to customs processes and cross-border pooling.\nThe free trade zone in Shanghai \"will be a testing ground for all future reform in China,\" said Debra Lodge, a managing director and head of renminbi (RMB) business development for HSBC North America. \"In 2014, we are expecting a lot of change, additional new pilots and just easier processes for multinationals to do business.\"\nWhile rules for companies operating within the zone require further clarification from Chinese regulators, Lodge said that she expects to see \"a much more open investment environment.\"\nShe cited, for example, the fact that within the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, there is no longer a cap on the interest rates paid on foreign-currency deposits of less than $3 million. \"The market was hoping for the same on RMB deposits, but that has not happened yet,\" she said.\nIn another development, companies doing business within the free trade zone no longer have to get approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange to convert U.S. dollars into RMB in order, say, to build a factory. \"Your capital account in U.S. dollars has been freed up, and you can convert that to RMB at will for appropriate transactions,\" Lodge said.\nThe ceiling on the total capital that one business unit can loan to another unit of their company located outside of China was boosted to 50% for those operating in the free trade zone, from the 30% ceiling imposed on companies in the rest of China.\nAnd in a development of particular interest to corporate treasuries, China has made cash pooling easier. Companies can use an RMB-denominated intragroup cross-border sweep to connect funds held within China, but outside of the free trade zone, with a global cash pool that their company operates outside of China via a designated account within the zone.\n\"This is going to give multinationals with a lot of currency movement and an existing cash pool the ability to incorporate their Chinese entities into the global cash pool,\" said Lodge, pictured at left.\nThe changes being piloted in the free trade zone touch on many aspects of doing business in China. For example, customs processes are being streamlined and electronic filing introduced. Employees of companies operating in the free trade zone may remit their entire salary outside of China, while workers in the rest of China are limited to sending a maximum of $50,000 a year out of the country.\nAnd Lodge said the March announcement by China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), that the nation is launching a deposit insurance program to be introduced first in the free trade zone is a huge step toward the liberalization of the currency. Currently China has no insurance plan for funds held in banks. A Physical Presence in the Zone\nTo take advantage of the pilot programs offered within the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, companies must have a physical presence in the zone and have an account with a designated bank, Lodge said. HSBC opened a branch in the zone in January, \"specifically for Shanghai Free Trade Zone business,\" she said.\nAt this point, the free trade zone is advantageous for the biggest players, Lodge said. \"If you are a multinational and you have a lot of transactions going through your accounts daily, then you should consider having a presence"

Those talks were a prelude to broader discussions during the spring meetings of the 188-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister lending organization, the World Bank.The G-20 joint statement was expected to repeat a pledge the group made at its last meeting in February that members would avoid using competitive currency devaluations to gain advantages in trade.Lew, previewing the U.S. objectives going into the meetings, said he would press Europe to do more to support growth and would maintain pressure on Japan and China to avoid lowering the value of their currencies to boost their exports at the expense of the United States and other countries.Lew said it was important that G-20 nations \"avoid a downward spiral of 'beggar thy neighbor' policies,\" the type of destructive trade competition that worsened the Great Depression in the 1930s.In Europe, countries are split over how much budget austerity to pursue, with some nations resisting a push by Germany for a strong emphasis on deficit reduction.Referring to disagreements over the issue, French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said Thursday that his government had chosen \"to keep open the engine of growth.\" He said, \"Germany understands that as prosperous as it is, as strong as it is, it also needs a strong France.\"IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that the United States, Europe, Japan and China all need to make adjustments to their current economic policies in order to boost a still-struggling global economy.\"We need growth, first and foremost,\" Lagarde told reporters.She said the U.S. and many other countries should focus more on growth and less on trimming budget imbalances this year while their economies are growing at sub-par rates.Earlier this week, the IMF lowered its outlook for the world economy this year, predicting that government spending cuts would slow U.S. growth and keep the 17-nation area that uses the euro currency in recession.Lagarde noted that the United States had avoided the \"fiscal cliff\" of across-the-board tax hikes and spending cuts at the beginning of this year that could have derailed the U.S. recovery. But she said Washington had made a policy error by allowing $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts, known as a sequester, to take effect on March 1.She said that a priority for Europe was \"to fix its frayed banking system\" and also where needed to moderate its austerity programs. Lagarde noted that Spain was struggling with high unemployment and therefore the country needed more time before pursuing aggressive deficit reduction.Lagarde rejected a suggestion that the IMF had given conflicting advice to countries such as Britain by first praising their austerity programs and then contending they were too stringent.She said the IMF had always cautioned that if economic growth started to falter, then a country needed to moderate its deficit-cutting programs.\"We very much stand by that\" advice, she told reporters.But Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA, an anti-poverty group, said the IMF's reduced economic forecast demonstrated \"a kind of schizophrenia at the IMF\" in which growth has been hurt \"due to the austerity policies the IMF previously promoted.\"World Bank President Jim Yong Kim told reporters that his institution welcomes creation of a new development bank being started by five of the world's emerging economic powers because new sources of capital are needed to meet the world's need to build new roads, dams and other infrastructure projects.The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa announced last month that they would create a development bank to help fund $4.5 trillion in infrastructure projects. The announcement was seen as a direct challenge to the World Bank, which has been accused by the developing world of having a Western bias.___Associated Press writer Desmond Butler contributed to this report."

Here is what economists made of the official figures\nThe number of people in work has reached a record high in the UK, raising hopes of economic recovery. Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA\nLast modified on Wednesday 17 October 2012 07.32 EDT\nJohn Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers There was more good news in today's labour market data with employment continuing to rise strongly in the three months to August, and unemployment, particularly for young people, remaining on a downward trend. The fall in public sector employment has slowed considerably since March while private sector employment has risen significantly. This supports our view that the economy should see a gradual recovery during the second half of this year.\nIn addition, regular pay growth edged up to 2% and is now only slightly lower than consumer price inflation of 2.2%. So the squeeze on real household incomes has eased considerably in relation to a year ago when the gap was over 3% and this should support consumer spending going forward.\nBlerina Uruci, UK economist at Barclays Capital Today's data indicates an improvement in the labour market - although it does not change the stock situation significantly as the number of unemployed remains very high at over 2.5 million. In addition, compared with the same period in 2007, the number of people in full-time employment has actually fallen by 355,000, while part-time employment has increased by 724,000. We think that with the economy still weak and consumer and investor confidence subdued, the underlying conditions are not ripe for a significant improvement in the labour market in the near term.\nDavid Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce The latest job market figures are encouraging and support our assessment that the UK economy has returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2012. The level of employment is at a record high, and the fall in the level of inactivity is a positive development, signalling that people are returning to the workforce. The strong trend in the labour market raises questions about the accuracy of GDP figures, which are still showing three consecutive declines over the period to the second quarter of 2012.\nDespite the positive job figures, there are still some areas of concern, particularly the further increases in the number of people that have been unemployed for more than a year, and for more than two years. The overall economic situation remains difficult. There is little doubt that the economy has been stagnant for too long, and forceful measures are needed to ensure that we return to sustainable positive growth.\nChris Williamson, chief economist at Markit The UK labour market continues to improve, with the unemployment rate falling to its lowest for over a year and employment hitting a record high. The labour market is an area where the business surveys and official data have generally agreed with each other. The concern is that the signal from the surveys has now turned from showing strong growth to a situation where companies are now cutting staff due to weak sales and uncertainty about the outlook, suggesting the good news on employment may fade as we move towards the end of the year.\nAlthough the third-quarter GDP data is likely to show a rebound from the drop in activity caused by extra holidays in the second quarter, the business surveys have signalled a deterioration in the underlying health of the economy in the autumn, and slower growth has induced an increased reluctance for companies to hire. This has been evident in the PMI survey, which showed companies reporting a drop in employment for the first time in ten months in September. Similarly, official data on vacancies has shown no increase over August and September (a 1,000 fall in August being offset by a 1,000 rise last month).\nScott Corfe, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research The UK labour market has defied economic gravity since the start of the year, with unemployment falling despite the UK economy contracting between Q4 2011 and Q2 2012. This has led to questions about whether the UK's economic growth statistics are inaccurate, painting an overly pessimistic picture. It has also raised questions about conventional economic theory. The labour market statistics provide some answers, suggesting that UK employers may be behaving in a different way during this economic crisis compared with previous crises. Instead of shedding jobs, many employers seem to be favouring pay restraint and reduced working hours as a means of controlling costs.\nUK unemployment and employment statistics\nUnemployment falls to 15-month low\nJobless rate down to 7.9% as number of people out of work falls 50,000 to 2.528 million, the ONS says\nSelf-employment: 'Success and failure is down to you'\nFalling unemployment in a recession?

But even as the total grows, there remains little consensus on the value of such deals. E-Mail\nAram Boghosian for The Boston Globe\n$84.1 million was used for film tax credits to make TV shows, commercials, and movies such as \"Here Comes the Boom.\nBy Todd Wallack\nMassachusetts over the past 16 years has more than doubled the amount of tax breaks it provides businesses to spur economic development but has only a vague idea whether the incentives are worthwhile, according to a new study by a Boston think tank.\nThe Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center found that the cost of the 58 \"special business tax breaks\"  -  covering everything from making movies to selling aircraft parts  -  has jumped to $770 million from $342 million in 1996. Unlike traditional spending items, such as grants or highway projects, tax breaks are generally not included in the state's annual budget, so they don't receive the same scrutiny as other programs.\n\"The tax credits need to be analyzed like any other state spending,\" said Noah Berger, president of the nonprofit. \"Is this the best way to spend our economic resources?\"The state Tax Expenditure Commission, a special committee charged with studying state tax breaks, recently concluded that Massachusetts probably has too many tax deductions, credits, and exclusions. It called on the state to review which ones are ineffective or unnecessary and modify them or eliminate them altogether. Neither the state commission nor the MassBudget report recommended any specific subsidies for elimination.\nOverall, the state forgoes about $26 billion a year through tax exclusions, more than the $22 billion it collects in revenue.\nGraphic: How $770.1 million in 2012 tax breaks were divided up\nBusiness groups say many of the tax incentives are needed to compete with other states, which offer their own incentives, and to offset the high cost of doing business in Massachusetts. The state corporate tax rate of 8 percent is slightly higher than the national average among states. Businesses also pay local property taxes, state sales taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, and an array of other fees.Jim Klocke, executive vice president at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, said the Legislature should lower tax rates across the board or expand incentives to lower the tax burden on companies.\n\"Businesses in Massachusetts pay very significant tax payments every year,\" Klocke said. \"Frankly, we need to find ways to make ourselves cost competitive that will strengthen our economy and will create more jobs.\"The MassBudget report did not examine whether the state needed the incentives to boost the state's economy or compete with other states. But it found that special business tax breaks have grown much faster than the Massachusetts economy and state budget overall  -  highlighting the need to consider whether the incentives are cost-effective.\nThe report found nearly all the growth in the cost of the economic development incentives since 1996 has come from more than a dozen new subsidies, such as the film tax credit program and the so-called single sales factor tax breaks for mutual fund companies, defense companies, and manufacturers.Under the film tax credit program, the state offers companies $1 in tax credits for every $4 they spend making movies, television series, or commercials. In 2011, for example, Columbia Pictures Industries received $11.6 million to film the movie \"Here Comes the Boom\" and a Los Angeles production firm received $9 million to make the movie \"Ted.\"The film tax credit program has been particularly controversial because many economists say the economic activity it generates comes at too high a cost. The state Department of Revenue estimated it costs more than $142,000 per job for local residents.Proponents, however, argue the program has helped bring a surge of feature films to the state, bolstering the economy and tourism.Meanwhile, Raytheon Co., Fidelity Investments, and other companies with operations in multiple states successfully lobbied the Legislature nearly two decades ago to allow their industries to use the single sales factor method to calculate what percentage of their profits were subject to state corporate income taxes.Previously, manufacturers, defense contractors, and mutual fund companies paid corporate taxes to Massachusetts based on the portion of their property, payroll, and sales they had in state. After the change, those companies began paying taxes based solely on the percent of sales from Massachusetts  -  saving the companies roughly $160 million a year.\nSupporters of the single sales factor tax break said it makes it more attractive for companies to expand their payroll and operations in Massachusetts  -  particularly since many other states also offer the single sales factor break or have lower corporate income taxes. But critics argued the tax breaks haven't kept firms like Fidelity from moving jobs out of state.The report found that 57 percent of the economic incentives are earmarked for specific industries, such as the film tax credit, and 12 percent are awarded to specific companies. For instance, Liberty Mutual received $22.5 million in state tax credits to help build a new office tower near its Back Bay headquarters.Todd Wallack can be reached at .

Moore\nPublished Nov 13, 2009 ShareThis Illustration by Dan Goldman The financial crisis long ago revealed the blustery truth about the wizards of Wall Street: They could be as self-dealing as they were brilliant. That was the basis, in fact, for the prosecution of Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, the Bear Stearns hedge-fund managers the government accused of fraud for continuing to plug their wares even as they frantically expressed gloom to each other in e-mails. They got off, but not without revealing how some hedgies really act around each other. Next up on the docket: Galleon Group co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, whose history of outsize profits may have been based not on a magic investing formula but on a knack for gossip. He's accused of insider trading.\nRajaratnam's downfall, and the lifting of the veil on the methods behind hedge-fund profits, signals the official close the hedge-fund era as surely as the 1986 arrest of arbitrageur Ivan Boesky signaled the end of eighties Wall Street. In retrospect, the rise of hedge funds was a hell of a bubble. There were over 9,000 hedge funds in 2008, up from just 400 in 1992. Hedge-fund assets metastasized to $1.9 trillion in 2008 from $592 billion in 2003 and $50 billion in 1993. Nowhere else in the financial industry was there money flowing that fast. A wildly successful investment banker could make perhaps $20 million a year in 2008\ufffdminor-league Hamptons-estate money. The most successful Wall Street trader, Citigroup's Andrew Hall, made $100 million: German-castle money. The most successful hedge-fund manager, John Paulson, made personal-emirate money: $3.7 billion in take-home pay last year, built, according to a new book, The Greatest Trade Ever, through years of insanely stubborn and often losing bets against subprime bonds. This is as freewheeling as the money business gets. Hedge-fund managers don't have to disclose much information about their strategies\ufffdand nothing about their specific trades\ufffdso money flew in and out of funds, nimbly aided by cadres of MIT-educated computer traders. Where the average investment-banking trade reads like a novel, with a beginning, middle, and end, a hedge-fund trade looks like a choose-your-own-adventure book. When one investing strategy fails, hedge funds instantly adopt another, until the biggest hedge funds regularly move in and out of trades so complicated and interlinked that they appear to be modeled on M. C. Escher staircases. Eleven years back, Long-Term Capital Management, the most famous failed hedge fund, lost money on no fewer than eight concurrent strategies all over the globe. The biggest hedge funds maintain dozens of complex strategies. Meanwhile, investors are unable to redeem their money for a year or more. The funds hold all the cards, and hold them closely.\nUntil now. In the past eighteen months, the hedge-fund industry has nearly halved in size, falling to an estimated $1.2 trillion in assets. The end of the bubble, of course, doesn't mean the end of hedge funds: They'll survive in a more modest, more regulated form. Mutual funds, for instance, were at the center of a similar bubble in the sixties and now plod along unremarkably. What has died is the mythic hedge-fund identity. Managers fervently believe in the purity of their purpose\ufffdthe unconstrained pursuit of profits. They tend to be Ayn Randians who play in rock bands. Many run their funds in Greenwich, away from the hierarchies of Wall Street. They do their best to exude an air of effortless brilliance.\nThe lack of transparency provides enough cover to make managers look like geniuses. It also provides cover, surprisingly rarely, for the occasional con man. As Randy Shain pointed out in Hedge Fund Due Diligence, the biggest variable in evaluating a hedge fund is figuring out the character of the manager. The sheer quantity of hedge funds and the intense competition can lead hedgies to quasi-mystical attempts to get an edge, from vitamin B-12 shots (Highland Capital) to, in one case, estrogen pills. But more serious, according to the Feds, Galleon sailed on the power of unscrupulous information. Next: Why Art Moralists Should Give the New Museum a Break\nHave good intel?

        "webpage": "Study: More changes needed in N.J. pension system\nLast updated: Tuesday, January 28, 2014, 5:27 PM\nBy JOHN REITMEYER state house bureau | The Record\nDespite the \"huge strides\" made by Governor Christie and the state Legislature just a few years ago, a new study out Tuesday recommends more changes to bring New Jersey's pension system back to health, including increased state contributions and more public employee givebacks.\nThe study released by the Common Sense Institute of New Jersey, a nonprofit think tank that advocates free market policies, looked closely at the separate pensions funds for teachers, law enforcement and general public employees.\nAuthors Richard Dreyfuss, an actuary and consultant who is currently a senior fellow at The Manhattan Institute, and Steven Malanga, a columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, also took into account the pension system changes enacted in 2011 by Christie, a Republican, and the Democrats who control the state Legislature. They included forcing employees to pay more for their pension benefits and suspending cost-of-living increases.\nDespite those reforms, which Dreyfuss and Malanga praised, the current funding deficit of the state pension system is somewhere between $45 billion and $56 billion depending on how it's calculated, they said.\nAnd New Jersey's pension problems remain among the worst in the country, with only Illinois in more dire straits, Malanga said. He also said Wall Street ratings agencies are looking more closely now at public pension debt, a factor New Jersey feels whenever it tries to borrow money for capital investments such as schools and roads.\n\"We are in a new era when it comes to pension problems,\" Malanga said.\nThe study offers a series of recommendations, including more transparent financial reporting, more public employee givebacks and a firm commitment from the state to make its actuarial required payment.\n\"Absent these additional reforms these pension plans will remain unsustainable with the only question being by how much and when insolvency will occur,\" the report said.\nAsked how imminent the problem is during a presentation in the State House on Tuesday, Dreyfuss said major problems would likely occur within two decades.\n\"If this is left unchecked, if you play this out 15 or 20 years, you have an increasing likelihood that these plans will be insolvent or unlikely to recovery,\" Dreyfuss said.\nChristie signaled new changes could be coming to the pension system during his State of the State address earlier this month. Democrats took that to mean the governor could be walking away from his commitment to increase the state's annual payment into the pension system, which is expected to be over $2 billion in the new fiscal year, though still less than actuaries would recommend the state put in.\nBut Dreyfuss said getting up to full payment as soon as possible should be a top priority, even above getting public employees to make further concessions.\n\"Ultimately, you need to properly fund these plans,\" he said.\nAnd he offered some sympathy for the current group of public officials, saying most of the damage was done in prior years by previous governors and Legislatures.\n\"It's unfortunate that the current body of policymakers has to deal with this,\" he said.\nChristie is due to present a new state budget next month.\n\"This is obviously going to be a hot topic this year,\" said Jerry Cantrell, president of the Common Sense Institute of New Jersey. \"I suspect it's going to be an interesting conversation between now and June.\""

But don't tell that to small business owners facing a tax hike.Obama's proposal would hit about 940,000 people who report business income on their individual or household returns, says the Joint Committee on Taxation, the official scorekeeper for Congress. That's only 3.5 percent of the people who report business income, but those business owners are projected to earn 53 percent of the $1.3 trillion in business income that will be reported on individual returns next year.That, Republicans in Congress argue, makes those business owners an important engine for economic growth and job creation.They recite it as gospel: Paying higher taxes will reduce the amount of profits business owners would otherwise re-invest in their companies, making them less likely to expand and hire more workers. Many economists agree that tax increases in general limit economic growth. But there are big disagreements about magnitude -- how much relatively small changes in the top two income tax rates would affect the economy and job creation.The Congressional Budget Office estimated last month that Obama's plan to increase taxes only on top earners would reduce economic growth by 0.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product next year, or about $16 billion. That translates into about 200,000 fewer jobs.[Article continues below] By comparison, letting all the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 expire would reduce economic growth by 1.4 percent of GDP, resulting in about 1.8 million fewer jobs, the CBO said.\"It's a very tiny portion of the cliff impact and it very much raises revenues and it does so in a fair way,\" Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said of Obama's proposal. \"It will not stifle economic growth in any significant way.\"Most of the expiring tax cuts were first enacted under former President George W. Bush and extended by Obama in 2010. This time around, Obama says he is determined to let the tax cuts expire on income above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples. He wants to extend the Bush tax cuts for people making less.House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans have said they are open to more tax revenue through reducing or eliminating tax breaks. But Boehner opposes Obama's proposal to increase tax rates on high earners.\"Raising taxes on small businesses instead of taking a balanced approach that also cuts spending is wrong,\" Boehner, said recently. \"It's only going to make it harder for our economy to grow. And if our economy doesn't grow, Americans don't get new jobs and the debt problem that we have will continue to threaten our children's future.\"Republicans often relate thObama's plan also would phase out the personal exemption and gradually reduce itemized deductions for individuals making more than $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000."

Rivera, an assistant professor of management and organizations and sociology at Northwestern University. \"But, beyond that, employers really want people who they will bond with, who they will feel good around, who will be their friend and maybe even their romantic partner. As a result, employers don't necessarily hire the most skilled candidates.\"\nTitled, \"Hiring as Cultural Matching: The Case of Elite Professional Service Firms,\" the study is based on 120 interviews with professionals involved in undergraduate and graduate hiring in elite U.S. investment banks, law firms, and management consulting firms as well as participant observation of a recruiting department. Rivera conducted the interviews\ufffd40 per industry\ufffdfrom 2006 through 2008 and the fieldwork within the recruiting department of an elite professional service firm over nine months in 2006 and 2007.\nAccording to the study, which Rivera said is the first systematic, empirical investigation of whether shared culture between employers and job candidates matters in hiring, evaluators at firms often valued their personal feelings of comfort, validation, and excitement over indentifying candidates with superior cognitive or technical skills. In fact, more than half of the evaluators in the study ranked cultural fit\ufffdthe perceived similarity to a firm's existing employee base in leisure pursuits, background, and self-presentation\ufffdas the most important criterion at the job interview stage. \"It is important to note that this does not mean employers are hiring unqualified people,\" Rivera said. \"But, my findings demonstrate that\ufffdin many respects\ufffdemployers hire in a manner more closely resembling the choice of friends or romantic partners than how one might expect employers to select new workers. When you look at the decision to date or marry someone what you think about is commonalities. Do you have a similar level of education? Did you go to a similar caliber school? Do you enjoy similar activities? Are you excited to talk to each other? Do you feel the spark? These types of things are salient at least to the employers I've studied.\"\nThe study also found that the cultural similarities valued at elite professional service firms have important socioeconomic dimensions. \"Evaluators are predominately white, Ivy League-educated, upper-middle or upper class men and women who tend to have more stereotypically masculine leisure pursuits and favor extracurricular activities associated with people of their background,\" Rivera said. \"Given that less affluent students are more likely to believe that achievement in the classroom rather than on the field or in the concert hall matters most for future success and focus their energies accordingly, the types of cultural similarities valued in elite firms' hiring processes has the potential to create inequalities in access to elite jobs based on parental socioeconomic status.\"\nAs for whether her findings about the importance of cultural fit in hiring practices at elite professional service firms are generalizable across other types of occupations, Rivera said they likely are to some extent. \"I think that the process is generalizable, but I think the degree to which cultural similarity matters in the decision to hire varies across occupations depending on their technical demands, their degree of social demands, and how structured interviews are,\" Rivera said. \"So, for example, if you were hiring a neurosurgeon, I think there would be more of an emphasis on performance than cultural fit.\"\nIn addition, Rivera said the types of cultural similarities employers value may not be the same for all occupations. \"Cultivating leisure time is a hallmark of the upper-middle and upper classes, and it's really important as a class marker and as a source of identity,\" she said. \"You may see different types of cultural similarities that matter in occupations that are less elite.\"\nAbout the American Sociological Association and the American Sociological Review\nThe American Sociological Association, founded in 1905, is a non-profit membership association dedicated to serving sociologists in their work, advancing sociology as a science and profession, and promoting the contributions to and use of sociology by society.

        "webpage": "GRA educates taxpayers on new tax laws\nThe Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), Osu Medium Taxpayer Office (MTO), has organised a seminar for taxpayers within its catchment area to educate them on the Self-Assessment tax law, and on the new VAT Act, to ensure prompt and voluntary tax payment. Consultants and taxpayers within Labone, La, Osu, Cantonment, Airport, and Ministries area, who attended the seminar, were also educated on rent tax, as well as tax returns and submission. Mr Kwasi Oppong Damoah, Assistant Commissioner, Head, Osu MTO, said the seminar was part of activities being carried out by GRA to educate taxpayers on their tax obligations to ensure compliance. He explained that the self-assessment law, as introduced by the Internal Revenue Act 2000, mandates taxpayers to be responsible for accurately computing and reporting their tax liability to GRA. \"The taxpayer is allowed to forecast, estimate and assess his or her tax obligations. He or she computes the tax liabilities with limited or no intervention of tax officials and submit to GRA\". Mr Damoah said the self-assessment was being introduced to help move away from what Ghana had largely been practicing under the Administrative Assessment, especially with Direct Taxes, where provisional assessment were raised at the beginning of the year and served on taxpayers. Taxpayers may then decide to object to the assessment and give reasons for the objection which when determined, and then the taxpayer pays the tax determined on objection. If no objection was raised, then the assessment has to be paid on four quarterly installments. Mr Damoah said though VAT has practised self-assessment right from its inception in 1998, and under some tax types such as Direct Tax like PAYE, Gift Tax, Capital Gains Tax and withholding Tax, self-assessment was being introduced to allow Large Taxpayers, and Medium Tax payers to truthfully assess and fulfil their tax obligations. \"The ultimate aim of self-assessment is to promote voluntary compliance, therefore if a taxpayer refuses to pay his or her tax we will also force you to pay\" he cautioned. He warned that GRA would carry out auditing on the returns and estimates brought in by taxpayers under the self-assessment and if \" a self-assessed person's estimate or revised estimate of chargeable income for an assessment year is less than 90 per cent of the person's actual chargeable income the person would be sanctioned\". He said while most of the tax laws were being amended, staff of GRA was also being re-trained on how to best serve taxpayers as clients and customers, and not as cheats. \"We are also talking to GRA staff to move away from conniving with some taxpayers to cheat the system\". He, therefore, advised taxpayers to set up appropriate record-keeping systems, and ensure that expenditure was properly recorded and classified for tax purposes. \"Ghana lags behind some African countries as far as self-assessment practice is concerned, and there is therefore the need to build the required trust and confidence between the taxpayer and tax administration, and also adopt the best practice available,\" Mr Damoah stressed.Source: GNA\" Previous | Next \"Sponsor Links"

        "webpage": "No bond bubble, Dudley says\nNew York Fed chief says earlier Fed action could have been more aggressive\nWASHINGTON (MarketWatch)  -  The Federal Reserve's expansionist monetary policy has not created a bubble in bond yields, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Monday. During an appearance at the National Association for Business Economics' annual meeting in New York, William Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said that the Fed was flattening the yield curve to help improve financial conditions. \"We look at this issue [of renewed financial asset bubbles] on an ongoing basis,\" Dudley said. \"To date, there is little evidence of problems or excesses, but this could change as the recovery proceeds,\" Dudley said. If the risk of a distortion of asset allocation increases, the Fed would look to use two sets of tools: a regulatory or \"macro-prudential\" approach and also Fed monetary policy, Dudley said. In his remarks, Dudley said that in retrospect, it's clear that Federal Reserve monetary policy wasn't as aggressive as it should have been in the wake of the financial crisis \"Monetary policy, while highly accommodative by historic standards, may still not have been sufficiently accommodative given the economic circumstances,\" he said. \u2022 Live blog and video of the Fed decision and press conference\n\u2022 First Take: Janet Yellen's no more confident than the rest of us\nThe central bank's policy was less powerful than normal, in part, because housing, one of the primary channels through which lower rates influence the economy, was impaired, Dudley said. The stimulus for lower rates also seemed to wear off as fewer consumers were induced to spend, he said. Savers' low interest income resulting from ultra-low rates also hurt growth, he said. Dudley said these factors led him to support the more aggressive third round of asset purchases adopted by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-setting arm, last month. In the wake of the crisis, the Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate close to zero and then purchased $2.3 trillion in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities to try to spur demand. The Fed also said it intended to keep rates low with the hopes that this would provide additional stimulus. While all these policy steps did help, \"nevertheless, I also conclude that, with the benefit of hindsight, monetary policy needed to be still more aggressive,\" Dudley said. \"Consequently, it was appropriate to recalibrate our policy stance, which is what happened at the last FOMC meeting,\" Dudley said. In his remarks, Dudley also said the outlook for the economy \"remains somewhat cloudy.\" There are still downside risks arising from the fiscal cliff  -  the name for the billions of dollars in spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to automatically go into effect at the beginning of 2013 unless Congress and the White House take action  -  and from the euro zone, he said. It's also possible that the U.S. economic recovery could turn out to be stronger than expected, Dudley said. And if the economy showed signs of strengthening, the Fed would not respond in a \"hasty manner\" until it was confident the recovery was securely established, he added."

        "webpage": "Business shoots itself in the wages foot\n\nThe opening salvoes have again been fired in another round in the war about a national minimum wage. And on both sides there are accusations of the selective choice of research to bolster arguments.\n\nIt is certainly true that there is a substantial body of data available that can be used by either side. But most of the data used by those opposing the idea tends to deal with the introduction of a minimum wage in isolation from other necessary interventions. Yet additional interventions are usually called for by supporters.\n\nThis was summed up in a recent article by Neil Coleman, the strategies co-ordinator in the Cosatu secretariat. He pointed out that a decent minimum wage would increase demand and so play a role in economic development, but only \"if combined with appropriate industrial and investment policies\".\n\nOne desired effect would also be to compress the current, obscenely large, wage gap. And the introduction of a \"floor level\" living wage would not, in itself, do that.\n\nThis is a crucial point and it is one that tends to be ignored by opponents in business because they do not want what they see as greater intervention in what is, in effect, the anarchy of the market. In this increasingly intense, dog-eat-dog environment, any increase in the cost of doing business is seen as a threat.\n\nWages are usually the biggest cost factor in business. But they also constitute the national income and provide the wherewithall that enables business to function because wage earners are also consumers.\n\nThe more money workers have to spend, the more products and services they will buy. Even Adam Smith, the father of liberal economics noted: \"Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer\"\n\nBut then Smith, much lauded by \"free market\" supporters, thought that supply and demand would somehow miraculously balance. He did not understand that a system based on competition in the pursuit of profit would result in the absurd situation of global over capacity and over production.\n\nThis is a fact that most economists and trade unions have also still not taken fully into account. And yet it lies at the core of the current and ongoing economic crisis.\n\nThe fact that in South Africa we have a declining manufacturing base can be attributed to this. Across various sectors, the local capacity to produce has been eroded by cheaper  -  often subsidised  -  imports in a world still awash with surpluses.\n\nAnd this in a country without an adequate social security net and where at least half of the national workforce earns less than R3 100 a month. Perhaps as many as a third of men and women in work earn less than R2 000 a month.\n\nYet most trade unions and human rights groups estimate that a bare living wage in 2014 would be between R4 000 and R5 000 a month. One of the simple  -  some say simplistic  -  arguments against a minimum wage is that the additional cost to business will be passed on to consumers. This, in turn, would result in rising costs across the board, and minimum wage earners would fall back into poverty.\n\nSuch a scenario is quite feasible if a reasonable minimum wage was to be introduced into the present system without any other measures. If , for example, a minimum wage lifted large numbers of men and women out of poverty, but the increased demands for goods boosted mainly imported items, this would be doubly worrying.\n\nToday, the ANC is committed to supporting a national minimum wage and government has has virtual alphabet soup of policy acronyms such as NDP (National Development Plan), NIP (National Infrastructure Plan), NGP (New Growth Path), IPAP (Industrial Policy Action Plan) and the MTSF (Medium-Term Strategic Framework).\n\nHowever, critics point out that, either individually or in combination, these plans and policies are still based on the same failed (neo) liberal theories. And there is no serious attempt to introduce, not only a national minimum wage, but also labour-based employment to provide the vast army of the unemployed with work at a decent wage.\n\nYet without a radical change in policies and more work with decent pay, the social fabric of the country will continue to fray and tear.\n\nAdam Smith was right and that's Noam Chomskys interpretation of Smith. This is why producers should ensure workers are equipped with the income necessary to consume their goods and services, a concept that Henry Ford understood well.\n\nAnd, like Smith, Ford also never understood that the system in which he was operating would lead, inevitably, to the absurdity of over capacity and over production, leading to unemployment, a decline in profits, more intense competition and various attendant evils, including environmental despoilation."

To paraphrase Don Mclean, \"their financial hopes have become a shadowy ghost, and all their dreams caught the last train to the coast. So bye-by, Miss American Pie.\" Conversely, America's wealthiest tycoons awaken each day to brilliant new horizons - horizons which illuminate a world of unbelievable riches. Yes, Mr. Mclean, they are becoming more and more bloated from gorging themselves on the \"American Pie\" - a pie that far-too-many other Americans may never even see.\nThinking people are learning to look past those boringly repetitive charges of \"class warfare\" when discussing income inequality. Recently, Pope Francis cautioned the world about the hazards of the extreme gap between the rich and poor. More and more critical concern is being expressed through a host of highly credible studies.\nThe huge worldwide charity organization Oxfam recently released figures that show, \"85 of the world's richest people make as much as 3.5 billion of the poorest people on the planet.\" (3.5 billion is half of entire world's population.)\nBillionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have both cautioned about the dangers of extreme income inequality on the economic and social fabric of the nation, \"How can anyone justify huge U.S. corporations paying their top officials 347 times more than their average hourly workers?\nThe Gini coefficient is the primary measure of income inequality. A Gini value of 0 expresses total equality while a value of 1 (or 100) expresses maximal inequality. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the official Gini coefficient in 2010 was 46.9, the most recent year for which data is available. That coefficient rises to 57.4, if capital gains are included. That places the United States among the most financially unequal countries of the developed world. (Source: Economist G. William Domhoff.)\nAccording to a recent Pew research poll, \"the dominant asset on the balance of top 1 percent income households is typically equity in an operating business while - for middle class income families, the typical equity is usually a home, followed by a retirement account. The unemployed and low-income Americans do not need any more esoteric high-finance reasoning. They know (in their collective gut) that they are hungry and their economic outlook is growing increasingly hopeless. They also know that they are on the receiving end of a gigantic economic injustice. It should come as no surprise that those who live in the glimmering world of the top 1 percent to 5 percent (or those who regularly kiss-up to those who do) would want to downplay or deny the injustice of income inequality. To this point, the recent headline of the op-ed in Forbes Magazine reads, \"White House Income Equality Makes War On Progress.\" In the words of House Speaker John Boehnor, \"Are you kidding me?\" Has Forbes totally forgotten American history? Historical research by economists Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williams shows that, \"at the time of the American Revolution, the United States was the world's most egalitarian society - and proud to be so.\" Alexis de Tocqueville, noted Frenchman who wrote extensively about America during the mid-19th century, stated, \"Among the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay in the United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of condition among the people.\"\nI find it nauseating to listen to the fear-mongers who whine that we are heading toward socialism, when the reality is that we are moving more rapidly toward the opposite national conditional - a plutocracy, where rule is by the very rich.\nI applaud the rich for their success. I do not nor do I personally know of others who advocate total income equality. Furthermore, I am opposed to those laws which allow far too many people to unscrupulously milk the social welfare system - depriving those who are truly in need of assistance. We certainly need reform at both ends of the economical spectrum, but this obscene level of income inequality brings shame upon our nation. We must pass that \"American Pie\" to everyone at the table.\nBud Morgan lives outside of Avon Park.

        "webpage": "Brussels, 11 March 2014\nState aid: Commission approves regional aid map 2014-2020 for Hungary\nThe European Commission has approved Hungary's map for granting regional state aid between 2014 and 2020 within the framework of the new regional aid guidelines adopted by the Commission in June 2013 (see IP/13/569). The new guidelines set out the conditions under which Member States can grant state aid to businesses for regional development purposes. They aim to foster growth and greater cohesion in the Single Market.\nHungary's regional aid map defines the regions eligible under EU state aid rules for regional investment aid granted by Hungarian authorities and establishes the maximum aid levels (so-called \"aid intensities\") for companies in the eligible regions. The map will be in force between 1 July 2014 and 31 December 2020.\nThe designated areas have a population of 7.6 million, or 76.71% of Hungary's population. The decision also sets the maximum levels of aid that can be granted to regional investment projects carried out by large enterprises in the assisted areas at between 20% and 50% of total investment costs depending on the area concerned. For investments carried out by SMEs, these percentages can be increased. Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquin Almunia said: \"The new regional aid map provides a framework enabling Hungarian authorities to support the development of disadvantaged areas over the next seven years by supporting investment projects that would otherwise not take place.\"\nUnder the regional guidelines, areas which have a GDP per capita below 75% of the EU average are eligible in priority for regional investment aid, as the main purpose of regional aid is to foster the development of the less advantaged regions of Europe. Under the new map, regions accounting for 70.4% of the population of Hungary fall under this category and will continue to be eligible for regional investment aid at maximum aid intensities varying between 25% and 50% of the eligible costs of the relevant investment projects.\nUnder the guidelines, other regions in a relatively disadvantaged situation in relation to the EU or national average can also be made eligible provided that they comply with a certain criteria and that they respect the overall population coverage, in order to allow Member States to tackle their own regional disparities. As these regions are less disadvantaged from a European perspective than areas with a GDP per capita below 75% of the EU average, both the geographical scope and the aid intensity are limited. 6.33% of the Hungarian population living in the region of Pest will be eligible for regional investment aid under this category, at maximum aid intensities varying between 20% and 35%.\nGiven the economic development of the Central Hungary region over the last seven years, the population coverage of the Hungarian regional aid map will decrease compared to the previous map. While most of the assisted regions will have identical maximum aid intensities, some assisted areas will have a slight (5 percentage points) increase or decrease in their maximum aid intensities.\nThe regional aid guidelines set out the rules under which Member States can grant state aid to companies to support investments in new production facilities in the less advantaged regions of Europe, or to extend or modernise existing facilities. The ultimate purpose of regional state aid is to support economic development and employment. The regional aid guidelines contain rules on the basis of which Member States can draw up regional aid maps valid throughout the guidelines' period of validity. The maps identify in which geographical areas companies can receive regional state aid and at what proportion of the eligible investment costs (aid intensity). Eligible costs are the part of the total investment costs that may be taken into account for the calculation of the aid. On the basis of the guidelines, the Commission adopts a regional aid map for each Member State.\nArticle 107(3)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) allows Member States to grant state aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment. The regional aid guidelines define these as regions with a GDP per capita below 75% of EU average and outermost regions.\nArticle 107(3)(c) TFEU allows regional state aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic areas where it does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest. The regional aid guidelines define these as areas of a Member State which are disadvantaged either in relation to the EU average, or in relation to the national average. The population coverage is distributed between Member States according to socioeconomic criteria which take into account regional disparities, including unemployment, at both EU and national levels. It is then for each Member State to decide in its regional map how to best use this room for manoeuvre to define more eligible area in order to address its internal regional disparities.\nThe non-confidential version of today's decision will be made available under the case number SA.37718 in the State Aid Register on the DG Competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of state aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the State Aid Weekly e-News\nAntoine Colombani (+32 2 297 45 13, Twitter: @ECspokesAntoine )\nOlga Leszczynska-Vargin (+32 229-65520)\nFor the public: Europe Direct by phone 00 800 6 7 8 9 10 11 or by e\u00admail Side Bar"

        "webpage": "Bernacke Could Face Serious Trouble Posted By Mark Weisbrot On October 31, 2005 @ 12:00 am In article,articles 2014 onward | Comments Disabled Ben Bernanke's first promise upon being nominated for Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve was that he would \"maintain continuity with the policies and policy strategies established during the Greenspan years.\"\nOf course, he was speaking to the financial markets, which tend to worship Greenspan and are rather jittery about change these days-as anyone sitting on the edge of a cliff and staring down into the abyss might be. But following in Greenspan's hallowed footsteps might not be so easy, nor would it necessarily be the best thing for the U.S. economy. After all, it was Greenspan who persuaded Congress in January 2001 that President Bush's proposed tax cuts were fiscally responsible, arguing that without them we would pay off the national debt too quickly. Oops! The gross federal debt for the current fiscal year is projected to be the highest in 50 years, at 67.5 percent of our GDP.\nAlan Greenspan made some other mistakes that have cost the American people dearly, and others that have yet to come home to roost. After initially warning of \"irrational exuberance\" in the stock market in December 1996, he reversed himself and allowed the stock market bubble to inflate to unsustainable levels. Millions of Americans lost much of their retirement savings in the ensuing, predictable crash.\nWhen the stock market bubble burst and triggered the recession of 2001, the recovery was fueled by an already established housing bubble that has now created more than $5 trillion of excess wealth. The Greenspan Fed helped this bubble along, too-although recently Mr. Greenspan has started to talk about it. But when this bubble bursts it will almost certainly cause a recession, and we will wish that the Fed had warned the public more clearly-and earlier-about the dangers of over-inflated home values.\nBernanke says that he, like Greenspan, doesn't see bursting asset-market bubbles as the Fed's responsibility. But the Fed Chairman testifies regularly on the state of the economy, and the Fed is the major regulator of the country's economic activity. It makes no sense to say that the Fed can warn of the dangers of inflationary pressures, give advice on spending and tax policy and everything under the sun, but must remain silent when a speculative frenzy poses an economy-wide threat to the nation.\nThe Fed can cool off a bubble without having to raise interest rates and thereby dampen other economic activity. For example, to deal with the housing bubble, all the Fed Chairman would need to do is explain the reality: since 1996 house prices nationally have increased more than 45 percentage points after adjusting for inflation. From 1950-1995 house prices increased at the same rate as inflation. It is easy to show that this sharp break with the past is the result of a speculative bubble. If the Fed won't do this, who will?\nBernanke seems less politically aligned than his predecessor, so he is less likely to imitate Greenspan's endorsement of such partisan plans as Social Security privatization. He is qualified for the job. But he is inheriting some serious economic imbalances. In addition to the housing bubble and the near-record levels of federal debt, we have an unsustainable trade deficit and a much overvalued dollar. The interest rate on long-term (10-year) U.S. Treasuries is being held down by Asian central banks' buying them, which could slow any time and drive these rates (which the Fed can't directly control) upward. This would probably pop the housing bubble. And then there is inflation, the Fed's main enemy, which was running at 9.4 percent annually over the last quarter. Ouch. Bernanke will be lucky if he makes it through his first two years and still has a job.\nMark Weisbrot is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, in Washington, D.C.

        "webpage": "Bank Failures In the 1920s, Nebraska and the nation as a whole had a lot of banks. At the beginning of the 20s, Nebraska had 1.3 million people and there was one bank for every 1,000 people. Every small town had a bank or two struggling to take in deposits and loan out money to farmers and businesses. As the economic depression deepened in the early 30s, and as farmers had less and less money to spend in town, banks began to fail at alarming rates. During the 20s, there was an average of 70 banks failing each year nationally. After the crash during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 banks failed - 10 times as many. In all, 9,000 banks failed during the decade of the 30s. It's estimated that 4,000 banks failed during the one year of 1933 alone. By 1933, depositors saw $140 billion disappear through bank failures. Gresham, Nebraska, had two banks - one too many for that small town. The bank in danger of failure merged with the other. Gresham resident Walter Schmitt (right) remembers the deadly consequences for the owner of the failed bank. When a new president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated in March 1933, banks in all 48 states had either closed or had placed restrictions on how much money depositors could withdraw. FDR's first act as President was to declare a national \"bank holiday\" - closing the banks for a three-day cooling off period. The most memorable line from the President's speech was directed to the bank crisis - \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\"\nSome economists and historians have argued that the bank crisis caused the Great Depression. But others have looked at fundamental economic factors and regional histories and argued that banks failed as a result of the economic collapse.\nWhether the fear of bank failures caused the Depression or the Depression caused banks to fail, the result was the same for people who had their life savings in the banks - they lost their money. At the beginning of the 30s, there was no such thing as deposit insurance. If a bank failed, you lost the money you had in the bank. Carla Due's family experienced the fear that a bank failure would wipe out savings.\nBirdie Farr's (left) father-in-law, Jack Farr, lost his savings in a Grand Island bank, but he was philosophical about it. Birdie says, \"There wasn't nothing for him to do. He said, 'Standing there crying isn't going to help.'\"\nLouise Dougherty's (right) father owned a bank in Perkins County.

By Niraj Chokshi\nA sign in the Denver-area marking the use of stimulus funds. (AP Photo/Courtesy of the Colorado Department of Transportation)\nPresident Obama had his own gloss on a possible grand bargain when he sat down for an interview with George Stephanopoulos this month. \"We can do sensible deficit reduction with a combination of entitlement reform, some judicious spending cuts, closing some tax loopholes,\" he told the ABC host. Do that, and lawmakers can figure out how to spur growth. It was a revealing moment: Even as many economists argue for more stimulus, deficit reduction remains job No. 1 in Washington. All economic arguments must now be described as attempts to slash the deficit. \"Stimulus\" has become a four-letter word.\nUltimately, this is a political phenomenon, not an economic one. Mainstream theory says deficits are bad in the long term but that governments must spend money in the short term to ignite demand during a slowdown. So today's problem - high unemployment - calls for more spending, not less, liberals say. Proponents of this argument include Nobel Prize winner and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, former White House economist Larry Summers, and Jared Bernstein, one of the architects of the administration's 2009 stimulus. \"Reducing prospective deficits should be a priority - but not an obsession that takes over economic policy,\" Summers argued in a January op-ed.\nThere's plenty of time to cut the deficit smartly and incrementally, rather than doing so all at once and risking a slowdown in growth, these experts say. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the ratio of debt to gross domestic product will remain at roughly the same historically high level for the next 10 years. It could worsen after that, but long-range projections are subject to big fluctuations. Meanwhile, health care spending, a key driver of the debt, may not be as dire as initially thought: Its growth has slowed significantly in recent years, meaning that Medicaid and Medicare spending will be 15 percent (about $200 billion) less by 2020 than previously predicted. If the trend persists, it would yield smaller deficits than predicted.\nBut conservative economists and pols say too much debt crowds out investment and holds back growth - and they have the public on their side. When Obama took office, more than half of Americans said deficit reduction should be a top priority, according to a Pew Research Center poll. Then the $831 billion stimulus failed to restore the nation to economic health. Now, Pew says, almost three in four call deficit reduction a top priority. In January, the deficit knocked unemployment from the top two slots on a Gallup \"most important problem\" survey for the first time since 2009. In a survey last month by Pew and USA Today, 70 percent said it is \"essential\" that lawmakers undertake major deficit legislation this year. Everybody in the economic sphere now gives lip service to the idea, even when they think it's a lower priority than stimulating growth.\nWhich is why Republicans have the upper hand in the political realm. Already, nondefense discretionary spending will shrink by 2017 as a share of GDP to its lowest level in at least 50 years, and the Senate Democratic plan achieves the same outcome. That doesn't even count the sequestration spending cuts. Spending would reach historic lows still sooner in the House Republicans' budget. Even the Congressional Progressive Caucus plan, which favors stimulative investments, gives high billing to deficit reduction, promising right up top to reduce the deficit by $4.4 trillion. The word \"stimulus\" appears nowhere in that plan.\nLiberal economists are especially frustrated by voters' lack of enthusiasm for stimulus. CBO found that the 2009 injection lowered unemployment by up to 1.8 percentage points in 2010. But because unemployment was still so high, this didn't look like much of a success. So further stimulus had to take on other names - unemployment insurance, payroll-tax cuts - to pass Congress or else languish without a vote. Senate Democrats proposed $100 billion in stimulus measures in their recent budget, and Obama advocated for a $50 billion \"fix it first\" infrastructure investment in his State of the Union address, but the prospects for each are unclear in an era of deficit-cutting zeal.\nIt's not just liberal lawmakers who are forced to pretend that they think deficit reduction is a prerequisite to growth. Nobody wants to be called a spendthrift: In his January op-ed in the Financial Times, Summers spent the first third of the piece restating the case for deficit reduction. Only in his fifth paragraph did he arrive at the point - that stimulus can't be ignored. Why? It was probably out of a desire to appear \"respectable,\" Krugman reasoned at an event downtown this month. No wonder pols like Obama are being so careful.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized the impact of a recent slowdown in the growth of health care spending. If the trend persists, it would yield smaller deficits than predicted."

And one way that could happen is through changing the rules for dividends and capital gains. If you own a share of stock in a company today, when the company pays out a dividend, the most you're taxed is 15 percent. And if you decide to sell the stock and cash out, you'd also pay 15 percent on your profits  -  the capital gains. The tax code has long favored investment income over the money you get in your paycheck. But today's rates are especially low, dating to tax cuts installed under President George W. Bush. Back in 2003, Congress set the top tax rates for both capital gains and dividends at 15 percent, lower than they had been since the 1930s. Now, President Obama wants to raise those rates, but only for the wealthy. Under his plan, for those earning more than $250,000 a year, capital gains would be taxed at 20 percent, and dividends would go back to being taxed as they had historically, as ordinary income, more than doubling the current rate. \"Of course it's never a bad time to be rich. But it's a worse time to be rich now because, you know, President Obama has clearly said he wants the wealthier Americans to shoulder a bigger burden of the tax liability,\" says Bill Smith, with accounting firm CBIZ MHM. Raising rates on investment income, as the president has proposed, would bring in about $240 billion over a decade. If Congress and the president can't reach a deal and the Bush tax cuts expire for everyone, it would be even more. Smith says that as a result, some companies are making sure to pay dividends before Jan. 1, and many people are cashing out investments to realize the capital gains in 2012. He speculates the tax changes may have been on filmmaker George Lucas' mind when he sold Lucasfilm to Disney earlier this year. Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center says he was wondering the same thing when the deal was announced. Lucas \"certainly will save if we have the president's plan go into place, or go over the fiscal cliff.\" Like $400 million. \"He'll save more in tax than we will make in our entire lifetimes,\" says Williams. Fewer than 20 percent of taxpayers report income from dividends, and even fewer get money from long-term capital gains. There are certainly plenty of people who have the two shares of McDonald's their grandfather bought them, or are supplementing their income with dividends from the power company where they worked. But Williams says that's not what you should picture when you think about who is benefiting from the low rates in the current tax code. \"High-income people are much more likely to have investments in the first place and more likely to have income from those investments,\" he says. \"And their tax savings are greater than those for people in lower income categories, because the difference between the capital gains rate and dividends rate and their ordinary tax rate is larger.\" Williams says more than half of today's tax benefit on investment income goes to people in the top one-tenth of 1 percent.Copyright 2013 NPR.

Photograph: Jim Winslet\nHeather Connon\nLast modified on Monday 23 August 2010 07.31 EDT\nThe millions of loyal investors who own stakes in Neil Woodford's duo of funds, the highly-rated Invesco Income and Invesco High Income, may be surprised to find a punt on the future of Zimbabwe lurking among the out-of-favour British companies that have become his trademark.\nWoodford has emerged as one of the biggest investors in Masawara, a fund set up in June \"for the purpose of acquiring interests primarily in Zimbabwe-based companies and projects in sectors such as agriculture, mining, telecommunications and real estate, which the directors believe represent investments that will generate attractive shareholder returns\".\nZimbabwe is, of course, more commonly known as a country where human rights are routinely violated; of extreme poverty and chronic food shortages; of forced slum clearances and land grabs; and of a dictatorial president Robert Mugabe's who runs roughshod over opponents.\nThe regime is so bad that it appears on the category A list of places to avoid produced by Eiris, the specialist in screening for ethical, social and environmental issues. \"Zimbabwe has a reputation as a territory laden with risk and the threat of crime, bribery and corruption,\" said Eiris spokesman Mark Robertson. \"[It] appears on Eiris's countries of concern list, which takes into account human rights risks, including such issues as respect for political rights and civil liberties, political instability, workers' rights, women's economic rights and physical integrity right. For these reasons many responsible investors avoid investment in companies based, or operating, in the country.'\nEthical specialist Amanda Davidson of financial advisers Baigrie Davies said the Zimbabwe investment had made her firm consider whether to boycott Woodford's funds and, although it decided against that, it \"highlights the fact that investors [in funds] have no control over where the manager puts their money unless it is in an ethical fund\". While ethical funds have to spell out their policies, including areas which they will avoid, conventional funds simply have to give a breakdown of the sectors and regions they invest in and disclose their top 10 holdings.\nThe two Invesco funds own almost 30% of Masawara, worth about \u00a315m based on the price at which they were listed on AIM last week. But that is negligible given that the two funds combined are worth more than \u00a316bn. Woodford has earned a reputation as one of the UK's most successful investors after more than two decades in which he has delivered table-topping performance, regardless of the economic conditions.\nHe currently favours tobacco and pharmaceutical giants such as AstraZeneca and British American Tobacco but Citywire, the financial website, says the funds have had other unusual holdings including property in Macau and warehouses in Russia. While they are UK funds, they are permitted to have up to a fifth of their investments outside the country.\nNeither Invesco nor Woodford would comment on the investment. But Masawara's own prospectus underlined that human rights abuses are not the only risk in the country; its prospectus contains 20 pages of risk factors covering everything from government instability though the unreliability of company accounting to the fact that at least half of all Zimbabwean businesses have to be owned by a national.\nAfrica is becoming a more interesting place for investors with a number of specialist funds being launched for the area by companies such as Fidelity and Investec, so it is possible that other fund managers will also have exposure to Zimbabwe. Henderson's multi-manager team, for example, has a small stake in a fund called Imara African Opportunities, which is likely to have holdings there.\n\"You should think carefully about where your money is invested,\" said Davidson. \"Even people who do not class themselves as ethical may prefer not to invest in places like Zimbabwe.\""

Linking International Migration and Development in Asia29 Dec 2011Working paper series The accelerating integration of the global economy has stimulated an increase in the volume and types of international migration. Migration often has a significant impact on economic and social change both in countries of origin and in host countries. In spite of the hightened importance of international migration to development, national migration policies often fail to achieve maximum benefits because they do not adequately integrate migration in development strategies.\nMaximizing Development Benefits and Minimizing Negative Impact of International Migration in the Pacific Islands Sub-Region29 Dec 2011Working paper series This paper reviews recent pattens of international migration from Pacific Island countries and concludes that migration has generally increased over the past decade but patterns vary between countries and sub-regions. Some countries not previously involved in temporary labour migration are now sending workers abroad. Facilitating Agricultural Trade in Asia and the Pacific, Studies in Trade and Investment No. 7423 Dec 2011Journals The growth of agricultural trade has direct implications for the Asia-Pacific region. Agricultural supply chains employ millions of people and there is a growing need for food commodities and high-value food products. The Asia-Pacific region is both a major consumer and producer of agricultural products. Its growth in both imports and exports is accelerating, but not to the potential. There is significant opportunity in this region to expand agro-trade especially due to population growth, dietary change of consumers and trade of high-value products. Pages\" first"

Credit union trade associations say their lobbying efforts contributed to a banker-supported TAG extension bill dying in the Senate.\n\"So far have seen little evidence of deposits moving out of the banking system or, as some had feared, moving from smaller banks to larger banks perceived as too big to fail,\" the Fed governor said.\nDuke predicted that large banks will focus their efforts on large urban markets, allowing community banks to increase their competitive position in rural, suburban and small urban markets.\nThe Fed governor also touched upon another topic of interest to credit unions: small business lending. The Federal Reserve System has a project under way to try to improve its understanding of small business credit markets, she said, which includes community banks.\nAs of September 2012, banks with $10 billion or fewer in assets accounted for more than 98% of all commercial banking institutions but held less than 20% of industry assets. However, they held more than half of all outstanding small loans to businesses.\nSmall business loans represent nearly 20% of their total domestic lending and slightly more than 40% of their total commercial lending, she said.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Duke said, banking organizations with more than $50 billion in assets accounted for less than 1% of institutions but held 75% of assets. While big banks hold almost 40% of outstanding small loans to businesses, they represented less than 5% of total domestic lending.\nDuke also said that community bankers have been successful in making the case against \"one-size-fits-all regulation.\"\n\"I can't remember a time when I have seen more regulatory proposals drafted that differentiate between banks based on size or complexity,\" she said.\nShe specifically cited Dodd-Frank provisions that exempt community banks, such as the Fed's $10 billion asset threshold for a number of debit interchange restrictions and formal stress testing requirements. She also mentioned the CFPB's recent qualified mortgage final rules that included safe harbors that exempt small institutions.\n\"We are encouraged by Governor Duke's words of support for smart regulations that do not overburden community banks and prevent them from continuing to serve their customers and communities,\" ICBA President/CEO Camden R. Fine said Tuesday in a release."

        "webpage": "How Poor People Help Rich Corporations Pay Less Tax\nBig U.S. corporations are constantly on the prowl for ways to reduce their tax bite, and it seems that they are meeting with a good deal of success. Corporate tax rates make up only about 10% of federal tax revenues today, compared with approximately 33% in the 1950s. Last year, 20 of the largest, publicly held companies paid no income tax at all.\nHow do these companies manage this feat? There are many ways to reduce a corporation's tax burden - all perfectly legal, of course. Sometimes, however, the methods used to take advantage of these tax breaks can be less than transparent.\nRecently, two particular federal programs have been spotlighted as favorites of big financial, tech, and communication companies: the low income housing tax credit, and the New Markets Tax Credit. Both programs encourage investment in low-income communities - and, very often, leave tangible improvements to such areas.\nOther times, though, investment benefits the companies themselves, while leaving poor communities no better off - and costing taxpayers billions.\nThe low income housing tax credit For banks and insurers that face federal requirements to invest in the areas in which they maintain a business presence, the LIHTC program is a win-win. Federal tax credits are awarded to states for specific types of housing projects; developers then may sell these credits to investing institutions. By purchasing credits for a discount, these entities could help create low income housing while paying $0.59 on the dollar, a pretty sweet return over a 10-year period.\nOver the past 20 years, 40,000 subsidized developments have been created in this way, at a cost to taxpayers of $92 billion. The costs of LIHTCs have risen appreciably since the 1990s, reaching $0.67 in 2009 to the more current $0.93 per dollar of tax credit. Still, the ability to write off the entire amount for tax purposes has motivated big companies other than banks and insurers to jump on the tax credit bandwagon, such as Google, Verizon, and grocery store chain Kroger.\nThe utility of this type of public-private partnership is obvious, and the program was spared in a recent congressional loophole-purging initiative. The New Markets Tax Credit Less helpful to struggling communities is the New Markets Tax Credit, created in 2000 to help improve some of the poorer areas of the country by increasing private investment in areas left behind by the economic expansion of the 1990s. In return, big investors could expect to claim a 39% tax credit, spread out over seven years.\nThe idea was to fund projects that would revitalize these communities, and provide much-needed new jobs. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office found that the lack of clear parameters for NMTC projects has resulted in large investors tapping public funding for these projects, when the purpose is to leverage private investment only.\nIncensed by the GAO findings, Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn responded by issuing his own report, in which he highlights some of the ways in which NMTC projects have been used to help investors, rather than poor communities. He notes that, because the guidelines are so lax, almost any community can become eligible for these federal tax incentives, which are handed out by area Community Development Entities.\nFor instance, he outlines how big banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and SunTrust have been the heaviest users of NMTC funds, going so far as to set up their own CDEs in order to receive federal funds directly. Since 2007, large financial institutions have claimed 40% of NMTC money. This situation wouldn't be troublesome if the funds were being used appropriately, but that often is not the case. Senator Coburn mentions many projects that seem spurious, such as using funds to expand a dolphin exhibit at the Atlanta Aquarium, and the building of a sculpture at a health and wellness center near Palm Springs, California. Senator Coburn notes that private investors claim over $1 billion in NMTC credits each year, and that the Joint Committee on Taxation predicts lost tax revenue to top $5 billion for the years 2013 to 2017. The problem whereby large investors are able to claim a tax credit on public, rather than private investment is very real: The GAO estimates that, between 2010 and 2012, 62% of NMTC projects involved a mix of federal, state, and local funds. Both Senator Coburn and the GAO are calling for more transparency for the NMTC program. The GAO notes that the complexity of the financial structure of many of these projects not only masks the true costs of the program, but its efficacy, as well. Perhaps reformers would do well to look to the low income tax credit program for guidance. A tax \"loophole\" for the rest of usRecent tax increases have affected nearly every American taxpayer.

        "webpage": "Chinese underground banker receives death sentence\nAP, BEIJING\nTue, May 21, 2013 - Page 15\nA businesswoman in southern China has been sentenced to death on charges of defrauding investors as the government tightens controls on informal financing that is widely used by entrepreneurs.Lin Haiyan (\u6797\u6d77\u71d5) was convicted of \"illegal fundraising\" for collecting 640 million yuan (US$100 million) from investors by promising high returns and low risk, according to a statement by the Intermediate People's Court of Wenzhou, a center for private sector business.It said the scheme collapsed in October 2011 and 428 million yuan could not be recovered.The case highlighted potential abuses in largely unregulated informal lending that supports entrepreneurs who generate China's new jobs and wealth, but often cannot get loans from the state-owned banking industry. The government is tightening controls after a surge of defaults following the global financial crisis sparked protests by lenders.Another businesswoman from Wenzhou also was sentenced to death last year on illegal fundraising charges. That penalty was overturned following an outcry on the Internet and she was sentenced to prison.The underground credit market is estimated by China's central bank and private sector analysts at 2 trillion yuan to 4 trillion yuan, or as much as 7 percent of total lending. In some areas, informal lending exceeds that of official banks.Many households provide money for private lending in an effort to get a better return than the low deposit rates paid by Chinese banks, which effectively force depositors to subsidize low-interest loans to state industry.Authorities have sentenced 1,449 people to prison terms of at least five years for involvement in underground lending since 2011, a Ministry of Public Security official, Du Jinfu (\u675c\u91d1\u5bcc), said last month.Lin started raising money from friends, relatives and coworkers in 2007, according to a statement on the court's Web site. It said Lin told investors the money was going into stock offerings and bank deposits but used it to speculate in stocks.Even as losses mounted, Lin continued to raise money until the scheme collapsed, the court said.The statement said the penalty still must be confirmed. All death sentences in China are automatically appealed to the country's highest court for review.The court took the unusual step of issuing a second statement to support sentencing Lin to death after a Chinese blogger questioned the penalty in a comment that included the phrase \"killing the witness.\"\"Lin Haiyan's actions constituted financial fraud that caused huge losses and seriously damaged the people and the state,\" said the statement, which was several times the length of the original announcement.It criticized the blogger for challenging the court's decision.A statement on the Web site of China's highest court, dated in 2011, says charges of \"illegal fundraising\" can be applied to an individual who receives more than 200,000 yuan of informal loans or causes losses to lenders of 100,000 yuan. Enterprises can face charges if they receive 1 million yuan or causes losses of 2.5 million yuan."

Seasonal factors, such as a shift in the loan mix, did put pressure on investment and loan yields, according to bank officials, but Reynolds said he thinks 2013 probably will get better from here for the company.Moreover, he doesn't see outside economic factors as uncontrollably limiting for the bank's prospects.\"They don't have to have the uncontrollable (cost) structure work in their favor for (earnings-per-share) to go higher,\" Reynolds said.In an analyst note he released to clients following a conference call between bank officials and analysts, Reynolds wrote that First Horizon shares are attractively valued for long-term investors.First Horizon's efficiency ratio, an important metric of the bank's progress, has fallen for the last three quarters. That ratio in the first quarter was 75.69 percent, indicating First Horizon spends 75 cents to make a dollar. That's down from almost 80 percent in the third quarter of 2012, and bank officials have talked in the past about wanting to get that percentage down as low as 60 cents.One reason the efficiency ratio is still higher than the company would like is because First Horizon is still dealing with the effects of its transition from being a national mortgage lending company to one refocused on its core businesses of regional banking and capital markets. In other words, there are still expenses that need to come out of the organization.Along with the company's expenses down 25 percent from the first quarter of 2012, meanwhile, the company has shaved its full time-equivalent employees for each of the last five quarters. That number is currently at 4,381, down from 4,629 in the first quarter of 2012.Year over year, First Tennessee's bankers grew average loans 6 percent and average core deposits 4 percent, while shaving expenses 8 percent. The company's capital markets business continues to provide steady fee income and high returns, with fixed income average daily revenues of $1.1 million in the first quarter.The company's provision for loan losses was $15 million, up from $8 million a year earlier.First Horizon chairman and CEO Bryan Jordan told analysts on a conference call at week's end the quarter reflects the bank continuing to make progress toward achieving its strategic priorities and successfully reorienting its business mix.First Horizon, Jordan said, also has been taking steps that include returning cash to shareholders and cutting expenses.\"We're focusing on areas of our business where we can create value for the long term - winning new business, developing our people, smartly reducing expenses, investing in technology, streamlining the way we get things done,\" Jordan said. \"The strength of our regional banking business, First Tennessee, and our capital markets business, FTN Financial, is apparent as we've refocused where we know how to compete and create real value for our customers.\"Jordan went on to say the company has hired several \"relationship managers\" over the last couple of years and that as part of adapting to customer preferences, First Horizon is rethinking its branch network from a number and size standpoint.Jordan added that the company is looking to host an analyst day in the fall."

        "webpage": "Asia Economy\nDirty Money Costs Developing World $6 Trillion, Led by China: Report\nTuesday, 18 Dec 2012 | 1:12 AM ETReuters\nCrime, corruption and tax evasion have cost the developing world nearly $6 trillion over the past decade, and illicit funds keep growing, led by China, a financial watchdog group said in a new report. China accounted for almost half of the $858.8 billion in dirty money that flowed into tax havens and Western banks in 2010, more than eight times the amounts for runner-ups Malaysia and Mexico. Total illicit outflows increased by 11 percent from the prior year, Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based group that campaigns for financial accountability, said in its latest report released on Monday. \"Astronomical sums of dirty money continue to flow out of the developing world and into offshore tax havens and developed country banks,\" said Raymond Baker, director of GFI. (Slideshow: 10 Corruption Hot Spots) \"Developing countries are hemorrhaging more and more money at a time when rich and poor nations alike are struggling to spur economic growth. This report should be a wake-up call to world leaders that more must be done to address these harmful outflows,\" he said. All the countries in the top 10, which this year saw India, Nigeria, the Philippines and Nigeria join the ranks, face significant problems with corruption, and in most there are vast gaps between rich and poor citizens as well as internal security problems. Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies increasingly are focusing on ways to crack down on money laundering, bank secrecy and tax loopholes to prevent funds stolen from public coffers or earned through criminal activity from depleting the budgets of developing countries. The sums are so huge that for every dollar in foreign direct aid, $10 leaves developing countries. China lost $420.4 billion in 2010 and over the decade lost a total of $2.74 trillion. And its losses are steadily rising. In an October report, GFI said another $602 billion in illicit flows left China in 2011 for a total of $3.79 trillion between 2000-11. However, the numbers in the latest report are not directly comparable with earlier data because GFI has updated its methodology, making the estimates somewhat more conservative. It measures illicit flows by calculating the difference between fund inflows from loans and net foreign direct investment, and the outflows from a country to pay for trade, cash transfers and other earnings. Aware of the destabilizing impact of corrupt money, Chinese leaders are embarking on a crackdown. Outgoing President Hu Jintao recently warned corruption threatens to destroy the communist party and the state. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin last week also put the issue high on his agenda as citizen protests over corruption mount. \"Our report continues to demonstrate that the Chinese economy is a ticking time bomb,\" said Dev Kar, GFI's lead economist, who compiled the report. \"The social, political and economic order in that country is not sustainable in the long run given such massive illicit outflows.\" Mexico lost $51.17 billion in illicit flows in 2010 for a total of $476 billion over the last decade, which does not even count the billions of dollars in bulk cash that probably left under organized crime and drug dealing. Malaysia, an export-dominated economy with a wealthy elite, lost $64.38 billion in 2010 and $285 billion cumulatively between 2001 and 2010, the report said. (Read More: Crackdown on Tax Havens Opens Opportunities for Bankers)\nIllicit financial flows have grown by 13.3 percent a year since 2001, robbing countries of wealth and benefiting a handful of corrupt leaders. Kar said the worsening picture over the past decade coincides with the globalization of finance and loosening of capital controls, changes that make it easier to transfer funds to Western banks and to tax havens. \"Until governance improves and measures to shrink the underground economy take hold, we will not see a sustained decline in illicit flows,\" Kar said. GFI called on world leaders to accelerate efforts to curtail the flow of dirty money by clamping down on secret bank accounts and ownership of shell companies; reforming customs and trade protocols so that export/import payments cannot be used to hide illegal fund transfers; requiring multinational companies to report their profits by country to prevent tax avoidance; and strongly enforcing anti money-laundering laws.

The new measures limit family benefits and force the middle class to pay over 40 per cent of their annual salary in taxes.\nGreek's Conservative-led coalition has passed the new tax increases to middle and high-income earners, self-employed and businesses. The new law increases the amount of income tax paid by those earning more than US$26,000 a year, limits tax benefits for having children, revokes tax breaks for farmers and increases corporate tax to 26 per cent from 20 per cent.It also increased top income tax rate to 42 per cent from 40 per cent for Greeks earning more than US$56,000 a year, which is the higher-end of middle class average in Greece. The new law was part of an overall package approved past November in order to qualify Greece for more bailouts in the future. It aims to save Greece up to US$3 billion in 2013.If the new tax changes would not have been passed, then Greece would not qualify for more bailout money to be transferred and the nation would have fallen short of paying its own bills. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras stated in the parliament that he had no other options and that the bill needed to be approved. \"Otherwise, we would have had to have saved that 2.3 billion euro [US$3 billion] through salary and pension cuts,\" he said. \"But we are making the savings in a socially just fashion.\" The opposition argues that the changes would negatively impact Greek citizens by putting more pressure on an already-stricken middle class. But the conservative-led government assures that the changes will lessen the burden for salary earners and pensioners making less than US$33,000 a year.\"We are not in favor of taxes,\" Deputy Finance Minister Giorgos Mavraganis stated. \"But in the current situation we must lead the country out of its impasse. Once we achieve stability we will proceed to cut taxes and simplify the system.\"Greek's financial crisis dilemmaSince 2009 when Greece's economy began falling apart under its huge debt burden the country has become dependent on international rescue loans with a total of 240 billion euro provided to Athens. As of now, 149 billion euro has been distributed to Greece from the Troika of international lenders.Just last month Greece has received another US$45.5 billion in frozen loans and now with the passage of the new tax bill it is on track to get another US$19.9 billion in the next few months. Athens was forced to implemented harsh austerity measures to reduce deficit and bring down the debt level.Trying to hold control of the economy at the end of 2012 Greece adopted a 2013 budget that involves 9.4 billion euro of spending cuts, mainly in state wages, pensions and benefits, all of which have already been significantly reduced over the past two years.The decision resulted in strikes and protest across the country. Tough austerity measures have also led to a drastic surge of unemployment - in September 2012 it reached a record 26 per cent, which is one of the lowest levels amongst the EU nations.

        "webpage": "Fine-tuning the finances\nBy James Robinson\nFinancial fine-tuning continues in the courthouse, with the Archuleta County Board of County Commissioners (BoCC) unanimously approving a reserve savings policy Tuesday.\n\"By committing to this reserve policy, this becomes a budgeted item. In effect, we're paying ourselves first,\" said Archuleta County Administrator Greg Schulte.\nAccording to the policy, the intent is to have $1.2 million (or 10 to 15 percent of General Fund expenditures) banked by the end of 2012.\nAlthough Schulte acknowledged the savings strategy was aggressive, he said it would not prove onerous to the county budgets. \"I believe this is doable. It is aggressive enough to make us set aside the money,\" Schulte said.\nIn order to accomplish the $1.2 million goal, the policy calls for a tiered savings approach, with $300,000 set aside each year between 2009 and 2012.\n\"The biggest factor that tells me we can do this is how we're ending '08,\" Archuleta County Finance Director Don Warn said.\nAt the end of 2008, Warn said the county realized a $400,000 surplus, and that projections for the end of 2009 indicate a potential surplus of $255,000. Warn said careful watch of expenditures will ensure the county can bank the requisite reserves  -  per the policy  -  at year's end.\nOne of the factors that may help make banking reserves possible is full PILT (Payment in Lieu of Taxes) funding as part of the Bush administration's emergency economic stabilization act signed into law in October.\nAccording to the legislation, the county stands to receive an additional $300,000 per year between 2009 and 2012.\nHowever, while full PILT funding may provide a much-needed financial buffer, some in the organization predict tougher times ahead with declining property values and thus, the potential for less property tax revenue collected in 2011 and 2012.\nBut Warn said county financial staff will be well aware of the revenue decreases before they occur, giving them plenty of time to prepare and make budget adjustments.\n\"That's the beauty of government finances,\" Warn said. \"Everything is in arrears. It gives us time to look at the local economy and plan ahead.\"\nBut while Schulte and the commissioners advocated the \"paying ourselves first\" reserve savings strategy, two citizens questioned whether the community wouldn't be better served if the money was used to return programs or services  -  such as Mountain Express  -  to pre, 2007 financial meltdown levels.\nCommissioner John Ranson acknowledged the importance of balancing a reserve strategy with maintaining program and service levels, although at this point in the county's financial history, he said banking reserves trumped attempts to return certain programs or services to their pre-crisis levels.\nSchulte said the reserve policy was based on the current level of county services and added that any proposed expansions could be explored  -  dollars permitting  -  during subsequent budget cycles.\nAccording to the policy, a commissioner resolution will be required to spend dollars from the designated reserve account. Furthermore, Warn said, the policy mandates that any expenditure must be repaid by the end of the year.\nWarn explained the policy should eliminate the perennial problem of having to obtain a line of credit to cover cash flow shortages at the beginning of each year. In years past, cash flow shortages have been common in January when the county has not yet received it's first infusion of property tax payments yet faces a number of big ticket expenditures such as membership dues, contributions and payment of insurance policy premiums.\nIn addition to approving the reserve savings policy, the board also approved giving preferential considerations to local vendors or contractors for non-capital purchases if bids are within 10 percent and if all other considerations such as product quality and service, are equal.\n\"If they (local vendors) can provide the same product and service, then we should do business with local vendors. It's good for the community,\" Warn said.\nThe decision to give preference to local vendors was formally incorporated into the county's existing procurement policy.\nIn other financial matters, the board approved extending the tenure of the Citizen's Financial Advisory Task Force for an additional year. Although the decision did not include a discussion of whom or how many will serve, that conversation will likely occur in the coming weeks."

In particular, attention is focused on two arguments: the belief in the efficacy of labour market 'reform' and specifically, increased real wage flexibility, as part of the means of improving employment; and, second, the rationale for fiscal tightening in terms of the need to reduce public debt and increase national saving both as proportions of GDP. It is argued that neither of these arguments is sufficiently intellectually coherent to warrant their continued uncritical use as foundations of economic policy, and most importantly as key parameters constraining social policy. This critique highlights the need for a more robust foundation for policy to tackle unemployment as well as a fiscal policy based on a much clearer debate over the pros and cons of public debt  -  a debate in which social policy-makers must play an integral role. Discussion of policy alternatives also allows for a consideration of so-called 'third way' policies. Novel or non-orthodox elements in the set of 'third way' policies need to be considered outside the constraints of orthodox economic thinking; specifically, in the light of criticism of conventional views on targeting inflation and assignment of interest rate policy, independence of the central bank, the assignment of fiscal policy to external balance, and the appropriate time-path of public debt.\nGraham White is Senior Lecturer in Economics in the School of Economics and Political Science, The University of Sydney.\nDownload in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format, 136 Kb.\nVolume 2, Number 2: November 2001, 67-87\nThe Drawing Board: An Australian Review of Public Affairs\n\u00a9 The"

But they need the parliament's support because, under EU rules, its deputies must ratify trade agreements if they are to become law.\nThere are concerns that sensitive issues such as agriculture and data protection could prove an obstacle in the negotiations. But Schulz, the socialist president of the parliament, was upbeat on the prospect of a deal.\n\"We have an enormous opportunity to create a common market of 800 million people,\" the 57-year-old German said. \"The parliament, from a point of principle, is very much in favor of a free-trade agreement with the United States.\"\nParliament's early backing will be welcome news in Washington, which has been wary of getting bogged down in endless negotiation with the European Union and its 27 member states, all with differing interests, powers and demands.\nThe promise of billions of euros in new transatlantic business at a time of economic stagnation in Europe appears to be overcoming traditional divisions over the merits of opening up markets to international competition.\nInitial estimates suggest the trade deal could add 0.5 and 0.4 percent a year to the EU and U.S. economies respectively by 2027, according to initial estimates, at a time when the euro zone is in recession and the United States expects only modest growth.\nEurope and the United States account for a third of world trade, and a deal may also allow them to define the rules of global commerce before China does, especially on areas such as services and competition policy.\n\"The United States' problem is that it is becoming more and more dependent on the Chinese and wants to diversify. But it is the same for the European Union,\" said Schulz.\nA trade deal could open the way for regulation on everything from cars to medicines to be unified across the EU and United States, removing barriers for businesses to access markets.\nMORE SPAGHETTI WARS?\nU.S. President Barack Obama endorsed talks last month and the EU's leaders have also backed the plan, hoping a deal with Washington will help Europe pull out of its debt crisis.\nEU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht, who negotiates on behalf of EU countries, told Reuters last week that November 2014 was the target to wrap up an accord since his term ends then and the United States holds midterm elections.\nSchulz was more cautious, saying the sensitivity of issues such as genetically modified food and data protection meant there may be obstacles that will take time to overcome.\n\"Let's be honest. Reaching a deal by November next year is extremely ambitious,\" he said. \"I think the Commission and the Parliament are capable of reaching a broad agreement, but you have to consider the individual European member states.\"\nSchulz recalled the \"spaghetti war\" between Italy and the United States in the 1980s caused by restrictions on Italian pasta exports. Last September, French wine growers complained about an EU plan to allow U.S. wine exports to Europe to use the word \"chateau\", delaying what one EU official described as a \"purely technical rubber-stamping exercise\".\nItaly and Greece jealously guard \"geographical indicators\" that give them the sole right to brand products as Parma ham or feta cheese. U.S. farmers see that as veiled protectionism.\n\"Opening up always depends on the reciprocity at the other end,\" Schulz said. \"I believe both sides are willing.\"\n(Reporting by Robin Emmott, Charlie Dunmore, Luke Baker; editing by Patrick Graham)"

        "webpage": "Senate Explores Ways to Improve Retirement Security\nFebruary 21, 2013 \u2022 Reprints As legislators come to grips with tax reform, budget deficits and Obamacare, retirement security also is coming under scrutiny.\nIn a recent U.S. Senate committee hearing on retirement security, Sen. Tom Harkin, chairman of the Senate pensions and education committee, mentioned that people are not saving enough for retirement.\n\"I have said this before, but the retirement income deficit - meaning the difference between what people have saved for retirement and what they should have saved - is estimated to be as high as $6.6 trillion. Half of Americans have less than $10,000 in savings.\"\nHe added that, \"these numbers are disturbing - and frightening. People who run out of money when they get old see their living standard decline, and they lean more and more on the social safety net, squeezing governments at all levels.\"\nIn the past, people could rely on personal savings, an employer-sponsored pension plan and Social Security, but pensions are going away and Social Security is in trouble.\n\"Stagnant wages and rising costs are making it tougher and tougher for people to save,\" Harkin said.\nAlthough many companies have stepped up to offer 401(k) and other defined contribution retirement plans, those rely too much on a populace that doesn't know much about investing.\nThe committee invited companies like TIAA-CREF and Fidelity to talk about how they are helping employees cope with these challenges.\n\"I am a true believer that we need to restore the three-legged stool, and that starts with rebuilding the pension system,\" he said.\nHarkin added that the government needs to do something to give middle class families the opportunity to earn a pension while making those plans more attractive to employers.\nEdward Moslander, senior managing director, institutional relationship management for TIAA-CREF, who spoke to the committee on Jan. 31, said he also is worried about the three-legged stool of retirement becoming unsteady.\nHe pointed out that only 14% of Americans are very confident they will have enough money to retire comfortably, and 60% of workers say they have less than $25,000 in retirement savings.\nIn research conducted among its own clients, TIAA-CREF found that 75% of people with higher levels of education are either very confident or somewhat confident they will be able to retire comfortably, compared to 49% of the general populace. It also found that 88 percent of those with a higher education currently are saving for retirement and 60% have tried to determine how much they need to save by the time they retire.\nFinancial literacy is a problem across the country, so \"we believe it is important to offer client tools that can assist them with making these decisions,\" Moslander said. These tools include online programs, access to financial advisors, either in person or over the phone, and comprehensive objective third-party advice programs.\nLifetime income products also should play a role in retirement security, he added.\n\"Due to our increasing lifespans, as well as the aforementioned concerns surrounding Social Security and the movement away from traditional pension plans, the draw-down phase will and should become a greater focus of the retirement security discussion,\" Moslander said.\nThe committee asked what percentage of Baby Boomers and Generation X are likely to run short of money in retirement, based on the current system/assumptions.\nAccording to Employee Benefit Research Institute research, about 44% of Baby Boomers and Generation X households are expected to not have enough money in retirement, if they retire at age 65.\nRetirement income adequacy is defined as having enough financial resources to cover basic expenses plus uninsured medical costs in retirement, according to Jack VanDerhei, research director for EBRI.\nIn May 2012, EBRI projected that the retirement shortfall for early Baby Boomers, those born between 1948 and 1954, vary from about $70,000 per individual for married households to $95,000 for single males and $105,000 for single females.\n\"The aggregate retirement income deficit number, taking into account current Social Security retirement benefits and the assumption that net housing equity is utilized 'as needed,' as well as uninsured health care costs, is currently estimated to be $4.3 trillion for all Baby Boomers and Gen Xers,\" VanDerhei said in his response to committee questions.\nWomen face an even greater challenge. Recent EBRI data found that the retirement savings shortfall for single Generation X females was $133,000. That amount is the average additional amount of savings needed at age 65 for at-risk single females in that age cohort not to run short of money in retirement. Thirteen percent of these single women could have shortfalls in excess of $200,000.\nThe biggest deficits are for women who work for companies that don't offer a 401(k) plan.\nRetirement adequacy can be improved with the presence of defined benefit plans, having future eligibility for a defined contribution plan and increasing default deferral rates to 6%, VanDerhei said."

Rural workers are more likely to work part-time, and many states that do not provide UI benefits to part-time workers have higher than average proportions of rural residents.\n\"Modernization of the unemployment insurance program through President Obama's stimulus plan can really help rural families struggling to make ends meet in these bad economic times,\" says report author Anne Shattuck, a Carsey Institute research assistant and Ph.D. student in sociology at the University of New Hampshire. \"For the 25 states that do not currently pay unemployment benefits to part-time workers, the ARRA provides an opportunity to update their policies so that workers can receive critical benefits if they lose their jobs. The American workforce has changed significantly since unemployment insurance was initially adopted during the Great Depression, and new policies are needed.\" The ARRA offers states the opportunity to receive federal incentive funding - a total of $7 billion - to make permanent modernizations to their unemployment insurance programs so that more workers who lose jobs, including part-time workers, can collect benefits. The brief notes that one in five American workers is employed part-time, and only 37 percent of unemployed workers are now able to claim regular state unemployment benefits. \"With the rising national unemployment rate, the safety net of unemployment insurance is more critical to American workers than any time during the last quarter century,\" says Shattuck.\nRural workers are slightly but significantly more likely than others to be part-timers, the brief finds: 21 percent of all rural workers hold part-time jobs, compared with 20 percent of suburban workers and 18 percent of central city workers. These differences are pronounced in the Northeast (23 percent of rural workers hold part-time jobs; 16 percent of city dwellers do) and West (25 percent rural versus 19 percent city).\nStates that currently do not provide part-time worker coverage are clustered in the heavily rural West, the South, and eastern Midwest. Of states that have more than one-quarter of their populations residing in rural areas, 11 (Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wisconsin) offer no part-time worker coverage. Other states that do not provide part-time worker coverage are Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington. Women in all areas would benefit from expanded unemployment insurance benefits as well; 27 percent of women hold part-time jobs, compared to 13 percent of men in the labor force today.\nThe complete brief can be found online at . The Carsey Institute conducts policy and applied research on vulnerable families and on sustainable community development, giving policy makers and practitioners the timely, independent resources they need to effect change in their communities. The University of New Hampshire, founded in 1866, is a world-class public research university with the feel of a New England liberal arts college. A land, sea and space-grant university, UNH is the state's flagship public institution, enrolling 11,800 undergraduate and 2,400 graduate students."

        "webpage": "Treasury says China is not currency manipulator\nWASHINGTON (MarketWatch)  -  The Treasury Department on Tuesday again declined to name China a currency manipulator, citing progress in the emerging nation's currency appreciation. In its semiannual report on exchange-rate policies, the Treasury said China's currency remains \"significantly undervalued,\" and that \"further appreciation of the [yuan] against the dollar and other major currencies is warranted.\" GOP senators remain critical after meeting with Susan Rice(5:00)\nThe U.N. ambassador's attempt to repair her standing with Senate Republicans appears to fall short, as a trio of GOP senators aren't assuaged given her comments following the U.S. consulate attack in Libya. (Photo: AP)\nPresident Barack Obama has argued that pressure from his administration has pushed the Chinese currency higher against the dollar. Treasury said that the yuan USDCNY, +0.1124%\nhas appreciated by 9.7% against the dollar since June 2010 and 12.6% when adjusted for inflation. Read the full report. Labeling China a \"currency manipulator\" would likely be more of a symbolic move, but it could have a trade impact. The designation would only trigger official talks between the United States and China over the value of the yuan. But analysts said the key impact of the label would be to give Congress a green light to impose tariffs on Chinese imports. Measures to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese products have long been popular in Congress, but have never cleared both chambers. Many U.S. manufacturers argue that China has held the value of its currency artificially low in order to lower the cost of its goods in the United States. Reuters\nPresident Barack Obama shakes hands with China's Xi Jinping (at left) in the Oval Office earlier this year.\nThrough September, America has run up a trade deficit in goods of $232 billion this year against China, according to Commerce Department data. That's wider than the $217 billion trade gap through the same period of 2011. Supporters of free trade worry that the tariffs might violate World Trade Organization rules and could prompt Beijing to retaliate, as it has done so in other trade disputes. For this reason, a succession of U.S. administrations has argued that behind-the-scenes pressure was much more effective to get China to strengthen its currency. In a statement, Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat of New York who has complained about the impact of Chinese imports on manufacturers in his state, said he was disappointed in the decision. \"It's time for the Obama administration to rip off the Band-Aid, and force China to play by the same rules as all other countries,\" he said in a statement. The value of China's currency became a election-year issue, especially in the swing state of Ohio. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had promised to cite China as a currency manipulator during his first day in office. He lost the state as well as the national election. Obama's campaign, in contrast, announced various trade sanctions against China and also criticized Romney's ties to Chinese companies. The last time that China was cited as a currency manipulator was in 1994, and that was for a completely different issue. Chinese officials have always denied that they were manipulating the currency and have said they would gradually allow more flexibility. Treasury said that reserve accumulation by China, an indicator of the degree of China's intervention in the currency market, has slowed markedly since the third quarter of 2011. ECONOMY AND POLITICS |\n\u2022 U.S. homeownership at 18-year low According to Chinese data, reserve accumulation has slowed to an average of $18.7 billion per quarter in the year ended Sept. 30, compared with an average $140 billion per quarter during the prior year. Even with the slower pace of accumulation, China's official foreign reserves remain exceptionally high. As of the end of September, the People's Bank of China held $3.3 trillion in foreign reserves, equivalent to 42% of China's gross domestic product. This stock of reserves is almost as large as the total amount of reserves held by all G-7 countries combined, according to the Treasury. Its report urged China to be more transparent about the degree of intervention in the currency market, saying that reserve accumulation only provides \"some indication\" of the country's moves in the market."

        "webpage": "City's finance director says tax cap is 'problematic'\nClerk rejects spending cap change petition\nMANCHESTER - The city's chief financial officer told the Charter Commission on Wednesday that the tax cap in its current form poses a \"serious challenge.\" Finance Director Bill Sanders said the problem with the voter-approved cap is that it restricts not only spending, but revenue - in particular the degree to which tax rates may be raised. \"This dual cap and revenue equation, which is so hard and arcane, will be a challenge in the future, a very serious challenge,\" Sanders told the nine-member panel. Sanders, who is typically measured in his public comments, said the restriction on revenue increases is especially problematic for the school district, since primary funding sources, such as state aid and grant money, rarely keep pace with the rise in inflation. \"As long as state funding stays flat and expenses keep going up, if we can't raise property taxes - if the aldermen don't have the option to do that, or don't have the political will - there will have to be a cost reduction in other areas,\" he said.Sanders said the restriction on revenue distinguishes Manchester's tax cap from the one in place in Nashua, which has been pointed to as a city that has managed to fund its schools under a tax cap. Manchester's tax cap, enacted in 2011 after being passed by voters two years earlier, limits increases in budgets and revenues - tax and fee rates - to the three-year average rise in the Consumer Price Index. The commission also heard from the city's chief lawyer, Solicitor Tom Clark, regarding the tax cap. Reiterating an opinion he issued last year, Clark said that the tax cap applies to the budgets proposed by both the school board and the aldermen.\"In my opinion, the way the charter is written, that is what it says,\" he said. At the same time, Clark said he was not the final authority on the meaning of the charter. Different interpretations could only definitively be resolved through the courts, he said. The legal counsel for the school district has argued that the school board is not required to submit a tax cap budget. The attorney retained by the commission, Richard Lehmann, told the panel last month that \"it's not clear\" whether the school and city budgets are to be taken \"individually or in the aggregate.\"The discussion has been followed closely by members of the school board, as they prepare to submit a budget to the Board of Mayor and Aldermen in the coming weeks. The ultimate authority to reject and establish the district's budget is held by the mayor and aldermen. Addressing another possible charter change discussed by the commission, Clark said that under state law, the requirement that a super-majority of the aldermen override the tax cap could not be altered.\"Anything over eight would qualify,\" Clark said, referring to the 15-member aldermanic board. Currently, 10 votes are necessary for an override.The commission also narrowed down a list of topics for discussion at next week's meeting. They are: making the school district a city department; moving up the time-line for establishing a school budget; reducing the mayor's role on the school board; and lowering the number of votes needed to override the tax cap."

        "webpage": "Median CEO Pay Tops $10 Million For The First Time By Alan Greenblatt\nMay 27, 2014 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Are you getting rich off the rising stock market? America's CEOs are. Median compensation for the chief executive of a Standard & Poor's 500 company was $10.8 million last year, according to a study by The Associated Press. That represents an 8.8 percent increase over 2012 and marks the first time that median compensation crossed the eight-figure mark. Much of the increase was due to performance cash bonuses, stock awards and options. The S&P 500 index rose 30 percent last year, while earnings per share increased by more than 5 percent, lifting CEO compensation, which is generally tied to such indicators. Bankers got the biggest raises, with total compensation on Wall Street rising 22 percent  -  matching the 22 percent they'd received a year earlier. Media industry CEOs also did nicely, with the top officials of CBS, Viacom, Walt Disney and Time Warner each pulling in more than $30 million All told, more than two-thirds of CEOs got a raise, according to the study, which AP and the executive pay research firm Equilar conducted using federal filing statements. Women CEOs made more than men  -  $11.7 million, compared to $10.5 million. But that applied only to the dozen women who were included in the sample, compared to 325 male CEOs. Last year was the fourth in a row in which CEO compensation increased, following a dip with the Great Recession. \"The median CEO pay package climbed more than 50 percent over that stretch,\" according to the AP. \"A chief executive now makes about 257 times the average worker's salary, up sharply from 181 times.\" Estimates from labor groups put the ratio even higher. With political attention to income inequality increasing, lavish CEO pay remains a potent symbol. Last week, a California state Senate committee approved a bill that would tie corporate tax rates to CEO pay. The tax bill would go down, on a sliding scale, for companies that paid its chief executive less than 100 times the pay of its median worker, while increasing for companies that paid CEOs more. Under a Securities and Exchange Commission rule expected to be implemented this year, corporations will have to calculate and publish the ratio of pay earned by CEOs, compared with average workers. The SEC estimates that this rule will require the average company 190 extra hours of paperwork, at a cost of $18,000. Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce published a report finding that the compliance costs would be much higher. \"The intent behind the pay ratio rule is inherently political as it is designed to 'shame' American businesses in order to placate certain special interest constituencies,\" the report stated. \"It is hard to understand the economic or logical argument behind the rule.\"Copyright 2014 NPR.

Postal\nNU Online News Service, April 13, 2:08 p.m. EDT\nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke characterized American International Group as part of a \"shadow banking\" system that played a key role in the catastrophic economic downturn of 2007-2009.\nBernanke says AIG's problems in the fall of 2008 \"exposed weaknesses in the statutory and regulatory framework\" for the shadow-banking sector, and \"meant that in practice they were inadequately regulated and supervised.\"\nHe put AIG in the same category as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, both of which had severe financial problems, and said their problems \"severely damaged the financial system.\"\nBernanke made his comments at a conference on \"Rethinking Finance\" sponsored by the Russell Sage Foundation and The Century Foundation.\nHe says the \"insurance operations of AIG were supervised and regulated by various state and international insurance regulators, and the Office of Thrift Supervision had authority to supervise AIG as a thrift holding company.\"\nHowever, he adds that \"oversight of AIG Financial Products, which housed the derivatives activities that imposed major losses on the firm, was extremely limited in practice.\"\nGaps in the Fed's statutory authority to oversee companies in the shadow-banking sector \"had the additional effect of limiting the information available to regulators and, consequently, may have made it more difficult to recognize the underlying vulnerabilities and complex linkages in the overall financial system,\" Bernanke contends.\nThe Fed was barred by a provision of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 from overseeing insurance-holding companies.\nBernanke says shadow-banking institutions that were unregulated or lightly regulated \"were typically not required to report data that would have adequately revealed their risk positions or practices.\"\nHe also says the shadow-banking system played a far greater role than the subprime-housing market in making the 2007-2009 economic crisis more serious than the \"dot-com\" bust in 2000.\nBernanke argues that \"...any theory of the crisis that ties its magnitude to the size of the housing bust must also explain why the fall of dot-com stock prices just a few years earlier, which destroyed as much or more paper wealth - more than $8 trillion - resulted in a relatively short and mild recession and no major financial instability.\"\nHe adds, \"Once again, the explanation of the differences between the two episodes must be that the problems in housing and mortgage markets interacted with deeper vulnerabilities in the financial system in ways that the dot-com bust did not,\" Bernanke said. \" Prev"

        "webpage": "Next up: Pension reform and infrastructure\nThe state Office of the Budget released its report Monday on the commonwealth's public pension crisis, which tops $41 billion in unfunded liabilities.\nThe report outlines the current pension situation and how the situation got to this point, along with the impact on the state's budget and the need for structural reforms.\"Absent meaningful structural pension reform, the state's General Fund budget is on a very predictable path that will force a choice between either fully funding pension obligations or making cuts to the core functions of government,\" Budget Secretary Charles Zogby said in a statement.Employer contributions are slated to rise at a feverish pace in the coming decade to address the current cost of pension benefits, as well as the unfunded liability. Policy makers this year introduced legislation that would address the former via a move to a 401(k)-style system.The latter was not addressed in that legislation, which has to be reintroduced in the 2013-14 legislative session.Revenue growth is expected to be nearly $819 million next year, Zogby said. However, pension costs are projected to claim about 62 percent of that amount.Meanwhile, the state has other mandated costs that also are expected to rise. Those costs are tied medical assistance, debt service and corrections. Those cost drivers, including pension obligations, add up to more than $1.3 billion in 2013-14, Zogby said, which means a $500 million shortfall.The pension crisis also threatens public education funding as well as public safety and additional funds for roads and bridges.Absent any reform, the state must continue spending reductions to balance its budget, Zogby said.\"The taxpayers did not create this problem, nor did commonwealth or school district employees. As we move forward, we must keep the taxpayer top of mind and not harm current and past employees,\" Zogby said. \"We will not touch accrued benefits, nor will we allow the pension problem to continue for future generations. We need to fix this problem for the future stability of both the pension systems and the commonwealth's budget.\"Shrinking state budgets could shift more of the cost burden to local governments and school districts. That means higher taxes or significant restructuring, making it more difficult to do business in Pennsylvania.Dealing with pensions, as well as transportation infrastructure funding and liquor store privatization has been listed among top priorities in 2013 for the Republican majority.Click here to read the full report.For a full look at the pension crisis, its impact and the reform suggestions, click here to read the Business Journal's special report."

The Federal Reserve has broadened its oversight beyond banks and now monitors a wide-range of financial institutions that could hasten another financial crisis, Bernanke said Friday. Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP)  -  The Federal Reserve has broadened its oversight beyond banks and now monitors a wide-range of financial institutions that could hasten another financial crisis, Chairman Ben Bernanke said Friday.\nBernanke said the Fed is still monitoring banks and other systematically important financial institutions. But it has widened its scope to include other important participants that could either trigger a crisis or make the system more vulnerable.\nChief among them is the so-called shadow banking system, which includes loans that are turned into securities and sold to investors. It was the breakdown of lending in the area of sub-prime mortgages that helped trigger the 2008 crisis.\nIn a speech to a banking conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Bernanke said the Fed is also looking more closely at asset markets and the nonfinancial sector, which includes consumers and businesses.\n\"Probably our best defense against complacency during extended periods of calm is careful monitoring for signs of emerging vulnerabilities,\" Bernanke said.\nThe 2008 financial crisis helped push the country into the worst recession since the 1930s. Bernanke said the country is still suffering from the effects of the crisis and economic downturn.\n\"Our economy has not yet fully regained the jobs lost in the recession that accompanied the financial near collapse,\" Bernanke said. \"And our financial system  -  despite significant healing over the past four years  -  continues to struggle with the economic, legal and reputational consequences of the events of 2007 to 2009.\"\nIn 2010, Congress passed a sweeping overhaul of financial regulation that President Barack Obama signed into law. But opponents of the law, including many of the nation's biggest banks, have mounted an aggressive effort to overturn key provisions that target some of the most influential institutions.\nThe regulatory overhaul adopted tougher requirements for these institutions that are considered \"too big to fail.\" Their collapse could put the entire financial system at risk. Many of the rules are still being finalized.\nFor example, banks are being asked to hold larger amounts of capital to cushion against risk. And regulators could seize a company that is threatening the system, dismantle it and sell off the pieces.\nAsked about these efforts Friday, Bernanke said that the Fed and other banking regulators were working hard to put in place the regulations needed to implement the too-big-to-fail provisions.\n\"Too big to fail is partly a credibility issue on the part of the government,\" Bernanke said. \"Will the markets believe the government will go through with its commitment to wind down an institution?\"\nBernanke said that if the regulatory overhaul has not adequately addressed this issue, regulators may need to increase the capital requirements further for banks. He said that could be preferable to \"arbitrarily saying banks can be no larger than a certain size.\"\nBernanke was also asked about regulators' ability to detect asset bubbles, such as the surge in home prices that contributed to the financial crisis. Bernanke said that's difficult to do. He suggested strengthening the broader financial system so that it is not as vulnerable to such triggers."

Photograph: Sean Smith for the Guardian\nJill Insley\nWednesday 7 July 2010 02.00 EDT\nOlder people are turning to equity release to generate money to pay off their debts, according to new research for Age UK.\nThe report Housing and Finance in Later Life, compiled by the University of Birmingham, found that more than a third of equity release customers used the extra cash to help clear their debts, while almost half have put it towards essential house maintenance.\nThe study also reveals that while a quarter of those surveyed have used equity release to make early bequests and large one-off purchases, the remaining three-quarters have used it as a way of boosting capital, either to increase financial security and enable a more comfortable retirement or as a last resort to relieve financial difficulty or debt.\nHowever, less than half of those questioned said they were \"very satisfied\" with the value for money offered by their equity release plan, even though 75% said the plan was right for their needs, 79% were pleased with the information and advice they received and 66% were satisfied with the safety and security of their plan.\nLouise Overton of the University of Birmingham and the report's author, said the research showed that equity release does not play much of a role in lifting pensioners out of poverty. \"This suggests a need for more consideration of how those with very low incomes and limited housing assets might benefit from equity release should they wish to use it,\" she said.\nFor many of those using equity release, selling their home and downsizing to a cheaper property was not an option. Age UK says that although more than two-thirds of over-65s are homeowners without a mortgage, many are living on low to modest incomes and struggling to maintain their homes. One in seven (14%) of those surveyed were in receipt of pension credit, and some of the respondents felt there was no option but to use equity release to pay for housing repairs in order to continue living in their homes - a key concern for many older people.\nAlmost two-thirds did not want to move away from family, friends and local amenities, just over half did not want the upheaval of moving house, and over a quarter said that it would have been too expensive to move house.\nAge UK said it was worried that many older people are finding it difficult to maintain a decent standard of living using their pension alone. The recession and rising inflation has further exacerbated this problem with many older people seeing their living costs rise as their savings and incomes fall.\nThe report argues that this could explain why equity release customers are getting younger, with the average age of purchasers falling from 74 to 72. Previous research for the charity found that about 25% of people reach state pension age with outstanding credit commitments.\nMichelle Mitchell, Age UK's charity director, said: \"Equity release is clearly a useful tool to ease financial pressures in later life, but anyone considering it as an option should first seek good quality information and advice.\""

Ryan\nBoston Globe via Getty Images\nIn the run-up to Saturday's GOP presidential primary in South Carolina, candidates have clashed over the role of Bain Capital  -  a firm that either creates or kills jobs, depending upon whom you believe. Front-runner Mitt Romney sees the bright side. Before entering politics in the 1990s, he co-founded Boston-based Bain Capital, one of the nation's largest and most profitable private equity funds. He has said he created 100,000 jobs while at Bain. But critics say that figure excludes the legions of workers who were laid off by Bain. Candidate Rick Perry, who ended his campaign Thursday, had described Romney's work as \"vulture\" capitalism. And former House Speaker Newt Gingrich repeatedly raised questions about the firm's approach to job-cutting. Before this controversy erupted, most Americans had never heard of Bain. That's because it operates in the private investing world, not the public market. In the public arena, anyone can turn to say, the New York Stock Exchange, and buy shares of a publicly traded company. But in the private equity investing world, only wealthy individuals and large institutions, such as pension funds, are welcome. That's Bain's world. Here's how it works: What is a private equity firm? This term describes companies like Bain, which gather up funds from wealthy individuals or institutions for the purpose of buying up companies and turning a profit, usually within four to seven years. The equity firm's managers get fees, as well as about 20 percent of the gross profits. A typical deal goes something like this: The equity firm buys a company through an auction. The firm then increases the value of the company by, for example, upgrading its accounting system, procurement process and information technology, or by laying off workers and closing unprofitable operations. After the private equity firm gets the company in better shape, it exits the deal by selling it to a large corporation or offering stock to the public. But often the effort to fix up the company fails and bankruptcy is the outcome. The rewards can be huge, but the risks are great too. So why is this controversial? Sometimes, the private equity firm uses strategies that critics say play out more as \"vulture capitalism\"  -  a phrase that some people are using to describe a process where investors make enormous profits while needlessly laying off workers. The Wall Street Journal did an analysis of the 77 businesses Bain invested in during Romney's tenure. It found 22 percent either filed for bankruptcy or shut down within eight years of Bain's investment. Even several companies that initially provided Bain with huge profits later ran into trouble. Of the 10 deals that produced more than 70 percent of Bain's gains, four eventually filed for bankruptcy. But the companies that succeeded were hugely profitable. The Journal concluded that Bain turned $1.1 billion in investments into $2.5 billion in gains in the 77 deals. The phrase \"leveraged buyout\" is sometimes used in connection with private equity firms. What is that? \"Leverage\" refers to large amounts of debt. Just as a lever can be used to help lift a heavy load, borrowed dollars can help lift a deal that otherwise wouldn't happen. Defenders say the deals can work well. For example, if a company is headed for bankruptcy anyway, an infusion of borrowed money may be a life preserver. The cash can be used to buy equipment, upgrade software or offer severance pay to unneeded employees. In the end, the spruced-up company can be sold to a larger corporation, or it can start selling shares in a public stock market. The profits can be used to pay off old loans and reward the investors. Critics say the strategy too often results in needless layoffs that do little to actually save the company. What is venture capitalism? That's another strategy for investing private funds. In this scenario, the equity firm provides capital (money) to a startup venture and then helps support the small company as it grows. The private equity firm hopes to make lots of money from successful startups, but the investors are taking bigger risks than bank lenders would be willing to take. We've also heard about \"crony capitalism.\" What's that? In a capitalist system, success is supposed to be determined by the free market and rule of law. But Perry's critics said that in Texas, he had been promoting \"crony capitalism,\" where the relationship between business and the state is too close. Under crony capitalism, the success of a particular business is dependent on the favoritism shown to it by the government, in the form of tax breaks, grants and other incentives. Perry's spokesman denied the governor had engaged in inappropriate business dealings. President Obama also has been accused of crony capitalism in relation to his support for Solyndra, a failed company that specialized in green energy technology.Copyright 2013 NPR.

        "webpage": "Your Email: Your Name: To: Subject: Message: Nor'easter complicates insurance for Sandy-struck businesses\nBusinesses in New York and New Jersey that were preparing insurance claims for losses from Superstorm Sandy now have a second headache: how to deal with new losses from an early winter snow storm.The snow and wind from the nor'easter made continuing power outages worse, once again snarled road and rail traffic, and may have contributed to fresh damage at businesses that had not made repairs yet from Sandy.\nDisaster modeling companies expect Sandy caused as much as $20 billion in insured losses, not counting flood damage that could add billions more to the total.\nInsurance experts say the nor'easter will only complicate what was already going to be a difficult and prolonged negotiation between commercial policy holders and insurance companies over what was covered, when and for how long.\n\"If an adjuster wasn't already out to identify what Sandy did - and there's probably a pretty good chance that hasn't happened in a lot of instances - and you had damage from (the nor'easter), you wouldn't necessarily know that,\" said Rick Miller, chief broking officer for the U.S. property insurance practice at Aon Plc's Aon Risk Solutions.\nThe most significant questions will be around coverage known as business interruption (my shop was damaged by the storm and so I couldn't transact business) and contingent business interruption (my shop is fine but my supplier's warehouse was damaged and they cannot ship me goods to sell).\nSandy was already expected to cause not only billions of dollars in business interruption losses, but also years of litigation over whether certain kinds of interruption qualified for coverage or not.\nPolicies typically have limits on how many hours coverage lasts once the interruption begins. Figuring out whether the nor'easter caused a new interruption or was part of an existing one, where time had expired, will be one of the thorny questions to be addressed.\nFor homeowners, the questions around the nor'easter are much simpler than for business owners: is my house damaged or not, and was it wind or water that caused the damage? Those questions have their own complications, but on a much smaller scale than the disputes potentially facing large corporations.\n\"It gets complicated because policyholders and their insurers are going to have to work out where the different causes of their property damage came from and how that implicates the provisions of the policy,\" said Jonathan Cohen, an insurance litigator at Gilbert LLP in Washington.\nCan't Tell the Difference\nAllianz, the German insurer, released a report last week indicating business interruption claims generally accounted for up to 70 percent of the catastrophe losses on commercial insurance policies.\nExperts like Aon's Miller say it is almost certain that property insurance policies will treat Sandy and the nor'easter as two separate events. That means two separate deductible payments for policyholders, raising costs even further.\n\"It may well become impossible to separate them out,\" said Robert Muir-Wood, chief research officer of RMS, one of the main firms used by insurers to model their disaster losses. \"Having an extra storm like that, from what I've seen, it's more that it delays everything, it adds another day or two to recovery.\"\nMuir-Wood said lower Manhattan, which he described as the \"epicenter\" of losses, suffered a storm surge from Sandy so severe it would be considered more than a once-in-250-years type of event.\nThat will create even more problems, Aon's Miller said, for businesses that had flood coverage but whose policies treated severe floods differently, or excluded them entirely.\n\"It's very hard to make a generalization because each of these contracts is going to stand on their own,\" he said.

        "webpage": "Why The Markets Shrugged Off French Vote By John Ydstie\nMay 8, 2012 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email A supporter of French President-elect Francois Hollande wears a mask of outgoing President Nicolas Sarkozy.\nOriginally published on May 8, 2012 7:41 am The arguments for growth policies as opposed to austerity are taking center stage in Europe after the French and Greek elections. His rhetoric aside, France's President-elect Francois Hollande is not rejecting austerity. In fact, he pledged to balance France's budget by the end of his five-year term, just one year later than his opponent, outgoing President Nicolas Sarkozy. That's one reason the bond market's reaction to Hollande's victory was a yawn. Jacob Kirkegaard, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the market correctly perceived that the president-elect is not going to embark on some huge stimulus program in France. Kirkegaard says that's likely to disappoint many of Hollande's supporters. \"He has led them to believe that he is going to usher in this new era of spending and the end of austerity through his rhetoric, but I think the reality is very, very different,\" Kirkegaard says. Nevertheless, Kirkegaard says, Hollande will push Europe to add a growth component to its strategy, \"which is something that in recent weeks Angela Merkel and other German leaders have been positive about.\" Strategies For Solvency The growth strategies being considered, however, don't involve boosting government spending at the member state level. Rather, they involve growth-friendly moves like reforming labor regulations, to make it easier for workers to cross borders and work anywhere in the EU. Other strategies include expanding the European Investment Bank, and funding infrastructure projects with bonds backed jointly by all EU countries, but most importantly Germany. \"What I agree with is that Europe cannot solve its problems through austerity alone,\" says Mohamed El-Erian, CEO of the giant bond fund PIMCO. He's concerned about too little growth in Europe, but also about too much debt. \"What bond investors are looking at in order to put in more capital is a set of policies that addresses too little growth and too much debt,\" he says. Bond investors apparently felt Hollande's victory was a move in that direction. Interest rates on France's 10-year bond fell to a seven-month low after the vote. Reaction In Greece There was greater market discomfort with the results of parliamentary elections in Greece. Moderates there lost ground to fringe parties on the right and left amid demands to renegotiate the Greek bailout package, with its tough austerity measures. The Greek stock market fell, and its banks were especially hard-hit. Jacob Kirkegaard says the results in Greece raise the odds that it may leave the eurozone, but he says the country's fortunes are unlikely to affect the world in the same way they did last summer. \"This is really a fight between the taxpayers of Greece and the taxpayers in the rest of the euro area,\" he says. \"This will be volatile, but I don't think it will have the huge contagious effect that we saw last year.\" Kirkegaard says that's because under the most recent bailout package, the big losses on Greek debt were already distributed, and Europe's banks are in better shape now than they were last year.Copyright 2012 National Public Radio.

        "webpage": "News | Vermont News Forecast is for slow economic growth in region\nBOSTON \ufffd Sluggish economic growth will continue in New England, with much of the region not seeing a return to pre-recession employment levels until 2015 at the earliest, according to a forecast released Wednesday.The four-year forecast developed by the New England Economic Partnership suggests that Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire will fare best over that period, while Rhode Island\ufffds unemployment rate will remain the highest in the region. Maine and Connecticut will also struggle to reach pre-recession job levels by the end of 2016, the economists said. The forecast sees average employment growth of 1.5 percent for the entire six-state region and average overall economic growth of 3.3 percent over the four-year period. The economists said 2 percent growth would be needed to make a significant dent in unemployment. The conclusions stem from the likelihood that the global economy will continue to sputter for the foreseeable future. New England has already experienced a disproportionate drop in exports to Europe.The forecast also hinges on one key assumption.\ufffdThis assumes, of course, that we are not going to fly over the fiscal cliff, that there will be some agreement to keep us from experiencing the worst parts of that,\ufffd said Alan Clayton-Matthews, a Northeastern University economist.But if President Barack Obama and Congress fail to broker a deal by Dec. 31 to stave off tax increases and massive spending cuts, New England will suffer harsher consequences than the nation as a whole, the economists said. In fact, according to an analysis by Moody\ufffds Analytics, four New England states \ufffd Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island \ufffd would be among the seven hardest-hit states if the nation goes over the fiscal cliff, and all six states in the region would be among the top 20 in expected job losses. The primary reason for this, the economists said, is that the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts would have a greater impact on New England because of its relatively high per capita income. The consortium of regional economists, which planned to formally present its findings at a conference of the business-backed New England Council on Thursday, pointed to wide variances in the forecast on a state-by-state basis. \ufffdMassachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire are expected to recover their jobs lost during the recession period and add jobs by the end of our forecast period,\ufffd said Ross Gittell, a University of New Hampshire economist and the partnership\ufffds forecast manager.The same was not true for other states. \ufffdRhode Island had the most significant employment decline, and it\ufffds going to take longer to recover,\ufffd Gittell said. \ufffdMaine didn\ufffdt have as significant an employment decline as Rhode Island or a couple of the other states ... but Maine\ufffds economy is very flat and showing no growth.\ufffdConnecticut may return to pre-recession job levels by 2016, but just barely, Gittell added.Housing was a bright spot in the forecast, with economists citing increases in both sales activity and median prices in most of the region. Vermont and Massachusetts were expected to see the sharpest rises in median housing prices over the next four years, Rhode Island and New Hampshire the lowest."

        "webpage": "Bank of England's Carney sees improved outlook\nBy DANICA KIRKA and PAN PYLAS (AP) LONDON - Bank of England governor Mark Carney said unemployment in Britain is falling faster than anticipated, raising speculation in the markets that interest rates may start rising sooner than expected. Following figures Wednesday showing unemployment dropped again, Carney said the British economy, Europe's third-largest, was showing clear signs of recovery. \"For the first time in a long time, you don't have to be an optimist to see the glass as half full,\" Carney said in a press conference following the publication of the Bank's quarterly economic projections. \"The recovery has finally taken hold.\" Nevertheless, he cautioned that the recovery still faced headwinds and now wasn't the time to tighten monetary policy. As well as holding its main interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent since 2009, the Bank has pumped 375 billion pounds into the economy to keep market rates low and encourage banks to lend. \"There is a long way to go before the aftermath of the financial crisis has cleared and economic conditions normalize,\" the bank's Monetary Policy Committee said in its overview of the quarterly Inflation Report. The British economy is still smaller than it was before it fell into the deepest recession since World War II. Britain's economy is about 2.5 percent smaller than at its peak in the first three months of 2008. Signs of life have emerged of late, notably in the housing sector, which many fear is beginning to overheat, particularly in and around London. Earlier, the Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate fell to 7.6 percent in the three months to September from 7.7 percent in the previous three-month period. The Bank of England is watching the rate closely, having said it won't consider raising interest rates before unemployment hits 7 percent. Carney sought to ease concerns that hitting that unemployment level will trigger an automatic increase in interest rates, calling it a \"staging post\" for thinking about policy. The faster than anticipated fall in unemployment, combined with a more buoyant economic growth outlook, to change the Bank's projections. According to the projections, the Bank thinks there is now a greater than 50 percent probability of the 7 percent threshold being achieved by the third quarter of 2015. That's been brought forward from the second quarter of 2016. However, the Bank has also revised down its forecasts for inflation, which remains its primary policy concern. Inflation is expected to fall to around the 2 percent target over the next year. \"Going forward, the Bank of England can rest easy _ inflation is falling while growth is rising, which can support policy remaining on hold for some time,\" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at Forex.com. \"We believe we will have to see the entire economy get back above 2008-09 levels to spur the Bank to action, and that could still take some time.\" That may explain why the response in the market was muted. The pound was trading 0.4 percent higher at $1.5951. (Copyright 2013 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)"

        "webpage": "Search U.S. Borrowing Is Less Of An Economic Worry, At Least For Now By Marilyn Geewax\nFeb 4, 2014 ShareTwitter Facebook Google+ Email Stock investors looking for a reason to feel optimistic about the economy may have found one this morning. A new report shows the federal budget deficit has done some mad shrinking in recent years. Thanks to spending cuts, tax hikes and a stronger economy, the deficit in this fiscal year will be only $514 billion, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday. Whoa, you might say. That's still a huge number. But compared with the whole U.S. economy, a $514 billion shortfall is manageable. It's 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)  -  down to the same level that the deficit has averaged over the past four decades. \"Things have gotten back to normal,\" said Gus Faucher, senior economist for PNC Financial Services Group. \"Spending and revenues are very close to long-run averages again.\" That's a tremendous change from 2009  -  the height of the Great Recession  -  when the annual federal budget shortfall shot to $1.4 trillion. That was about 10 percent of GDP, a level that was far outside of historical norms. Many economists worried then about the long-term drag such an enormous deficit would have on the economy. The fear is always that government might borrow so heavily that it could pull money away from businesses that need cash for expansions. If Uncle Sam were to start gobbling up nearly all of the money available for loans, then corporations and consumers would have to pay higher interest rates to attract lenders, the argument goes. That would be a formula for very slow economic growth. So Tuesday's CBO news calms those fears, and suggests that after a five-year crisis, the U.S. economy is returning to more normal footing. Stocks mostly turned positive in the morning, following a rough trading session on Monday. The CBO projects that the 2015 deficit will be even more encouraging, slipping to $478 billion, or 2.6 percent of GDP. After that, it should stay below 3 percent for the following couple of years. But the big problems come after that as government spending rises again. The projection for 2022 is back to a deficit of $1 trillion, or 4 percent of GDP. \"Spending is boosted by the aging of the population, the expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, rising health care costs per beneficiary, and mounting interest costs on federal debt,\" the CBO said. So there's plenty to worry about in the long term, but at least for now, the picture looks a little brighter. The next big government report that could help  -  or hurt  -  stock prices is due out Friday, when the Labor Department will issue its monthly jobs report.Copyright 2014 NPR. To see more, visit .

        "webpage": "Succession planning: Deep resources and objectivity help a family patriarch plan his future\nFamily business executives in their middle years face real choices when it comes to succession. Who will take up the mantle? Will they want to do it? How will control be divided, if at all? Are there ways to protect family assets in the process? What are the tax considerations? Are my kids ready to take charge? Such was the situation for a private company executive who had inherited a business from his father and turned it into a robust enterprise with double-digit growth and revenues in excess of $50 million. The owner was certain he wanted to pass the company down to his kids, but he wasn't sure when and how to do it. So he reached out to PwC for help.\n\"His initial concerns were about whether his kids were ready to run the business, and what was going to be the mechanism to make that transfer. He wanted to know, 'How do I avoid this big estate tax that may cause my heirs to have to sell my company?'\" recalled PwC Personal Financial Services partner, Karl Weger. \"Yet at the same time, he wanted to remain in control of the business for as long as possible - perhaps for the rest of his life.\" So Weger and his team worked to develop a succession plan that would lay the foundation for a handoff, yet keep control in the executive's hands. The PwC team began by helping recapitalize the company into voting and non-voting shares. This would allow the owner to disperse the wealth of his company to the next generation in a tax-efficient manner over several years, forming trusts and protecting the assets from creditor or divorce claims.\nThe team also provided guidance to avoid the possibility of a sudden untenable tax burden for the executive's children upon his death - a surprise that often confounds other families who fail to plan ahead. PwC also encouraged the company to establish a true board of directors while the executive was still there so that the board would be in a position to offer unbiased advice to the next generation of company management.\nDuring the next several years, the company performed extremely well, growing its revenues three-fold and expanding into other countries. Buyout offers poured in, and the business owner began to reconsider his succession plan.\nHe decided to sell the company. Because he still had control of the business, the executive was able to seize the opportunity and act on it without the possibility of derailment by family dissent. The owner sold 90% of the family stake. In doing so, he relinquished family control, but gained a healthy nest egg for his retirement and funding for the children's trusts through sale of their non-voting shares.\nThroughout this process, a range of potential issues presented themselves: income and estate tax considerations, governance, and valuation, along with the myriad details of preparing a company to be sold and managing the wealth that results from the sale. PwC was on hand to assist with all of them.\nToday, the family remains minority shareholders with a 10% stake in their former company. Some of the children still work there, as do other key employees and stakeholders.\nBecause the owner had a well-considered succession plan developed and managed by PwC's objective team of advisors, he was able to react and adapt to changing business conditions and make well-informed business decisions while preserving the value of his business both to himself and to his heirs.\n\"When we first began, he thought he was going to be getting primarily income tax and wealth transfer tax advice,\" said Weger. \"Which, of course he did, along with advice and assistance in a great many other areas. But, over the years, he began to call and ask questions about things that he was thinking of doing in the business, to ask 'How will this impact my plan? What do you think of this?' He came to see our relationship as so much more than just taxes.\nPrivate Company ServicesBusiness issuesAudit and assuranceTaxAdvisoryPrivate wealthFamily officesPersonal financial services2015 Guide to tax and wealth managementEmployee Financial EducationFamily businessStrategy and growthGovernanceBusiness transitionPrivate wealthValues and philanthropyPublicationsEvents & webcastsPress roomMeet the teamVideosContact us365\u2122 app\nPanson\nPrivate Company Services Leader\nTel: +1 (973) 236 5677"

        "webpage": "Even without Bernanke, Jackson Hole's a hot ticket\nJACKSON HOLE, Wyo. (AP)  -  Ben Bernanke is a no-show. No matter. Despite the absence of the Federal Reserve chairman, this year's annual economic conference in Jackson Hole has once again proved a destination of choice for central bankers.\nIn international banking circles, the Jackson Hole gathering, held each August in a rustic lodge in Grand Teton National Park, is akin to Academy Awards night. If you're invited, the message is clear: You're someone who matters.\nThis is the first year in more than two decades that a Fed chief hasn't given the keynote speech to open the two-day conference, which ended Saturday. News last spring that Bernanke would skip this year's conference was taken as a signal that he'll leave the Fed when his term ends in January.\nWith speculation intensifying over his successor, a spotlight has fallen on Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen, one of two leading contenders. Yellen is here. Her chief rival, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, is not.\nYellen is among 10 members of the 19-member Federal Open Market Committee in attendance. The FOMC comprises the Fed board members and regional bank presidents who set the central bank's interest-rate policies.\nCentral bankers from every major economy, from Germany and Britain to Japan and China, are here. So are those of smaller nations from Albania to Malta.\nAmong the 130 guests are many scholars of economic policy. They're joined by top economists from financial firms  -  at least those who managed to score an invite.\nAttendees spend hours in a windowless conference room hearing and discussing presentations of academic research. They do get afternoons off  -  to hike, go rafting or take bus tours. But even against the backdrop of majestic mountain grandeur, many of the Ph.D. scholars have been known to go right on debating economics through the day.\nOne issue not on the agenda but a hot topic at the edges of the conference: The campaigns waged by supporters of Yellen and Summers to secure the nomination of their candidate. From the use of Twitter and opinion columns to behind-the-scenes lobbying and letters signed by Senate Democrats, the battle to influence the president's mind has been raging.\nFed officials here have been careful not to take sides in the contest, at least not publicly. They do agree on this: They've not seen anything quite like this summer's public jousting.\nDennis Lockhart, head of the Atlanta regional Fed bank, called it unprecedented. But he said the jockeying over the chairman's job is having no effect on the Fed's policymaking.\n\"The chairman's leadership is as strong as it has ever been,\" Lockhart said in an interview on CNBC.\nHe was addressing concerns that the prolonged contest to succeed Bernanke might weaken his influence as chairman by solidifying the perception that he's a lame duck.\nJames Bullard, head of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, noted that a change in the Fed chairmanship has been fairly unusual since World War II. Bernanke has served for nearly eight years. Two of his predecessors  -  William McChesney Martin (1951-1970) and Alan Greenspan (1987-2006)  -  served for a combined nearly four decades.\nAs for whom he would prefer as chairman, Yellen or Summers, Bullard, also interviewed on CNBC, struck a diplomatic note.\nThey're both \"great economists,\" he said.\nYellen did have a modest role to play at this year's conference, serving as the moderator for Saturday's session. It was a job she performed with fair minded diligence.\n\"My job today is to be a ruthless time keeper,\" she told the crowd in her opening comments. And she kept to her word, turning over numbered cards signaling to the presenters how much time they had left to present papers on such esoteric topics as global liquidity and cross-border capital flows.\nShe then had the job of picking the lucky participants in the audience who got to ask questions. At one point, she called on Donald Kohn, her predecessor as vice chairman at the Federal Reserve and one of three names President Barack Obama has provided as the leading candidates for the Fed chairman's job. Yellen and Summers are the other two.\nYellen didn't offer any substantive comments during her moderating stint, but there was one brief moment she had to have enjoyed.\nAcknowledging her introduction, Princeton economics professor Jean-Pierre Landau said, \"Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.\"\nAh. Music to her ears.\nAt the opening dinner Thursday night, Esther George, who as head of the Kansas City regional Fed bank is the conference host, had some fun with the topic of Bernanke's absence.\n\"Sometimes,\" George said in her welcoming remarks, \"those who regularly attend are not able to make it. We make it a practice never to talk about those who turn us down.\"\n\"Despite my personal disappointment,\" she went on, she'd be happy to welcome back Ken Rogoff for future conferences.\nHer mention of Rogoff, a well-known Harvard economist, rather than Bernanke, drew laughter from the audience.\nCall it economists' humor.\nCoal contributors target Ohio GOP legislators, gov\nFirefighter deaths factor into Ariz. mayoral race"

        "webpage": "Is a guaranteed minimum income the answer?\nLast updated: May 06. 2014 12:14AM - 518 Views\nBy Dr. Tracy Miller Contributing Columnist\nDr. Tracy MillerContributing Columnist\nRecently, some commentators have been promoting the idea of a government guaranteed income, where the government would pay a monthly cash payment to every American, regardless of need or merit. A similar idea, the negative income tax, has been discussed by economists for decades. In Switzerland, voters will soon consider a referendum that would require the Swiss government to pay every adult citizen $2,800 per month. Although it sounds appealing, a government guaranteed income is a bad idea, and its defenders rely on fallacious economic arguments to support it.According to proponents, a guaranteed minimum income (GMI) could actually limit the power of the government, since all the bureaucrats who administer existing antipoverty programs would no longer be needed. Those paternalistic programs rob the poor of their freedom and dignity in order to ensure that they are behaving in ways the government approves. By contrast, eligibility for a GMI would be easy to assess so that few government employees would be needed. The savings in administrative costs from eliminating most other government antipoverty programs might make it possible to pay everyone a minimum income without raising taxes at all.The above argument reflects a misunderstanding of the way our political system works. In particular, government employees who administer other entitlement programs would lobby hard to keep their jobs. Thus, if proponents of a GMI could convince Congress to pass it, few if any other government programs would likely be eliminated, as each could be justified as satisfying some purpose that might not be fully met with a GMI. At a minimum this new entitlement program would have to be just as generous to everyone as existing programs besides providing income for many who are not eligible for those programs. Thus a guaranteed minimum income would mean more government spending, necessitating higher taxes to pay for it.Some argue that this plan will enhance societal stability and make politicians look good in the eyes of the public. Instead of blaming them for the way that the regulations and taxes they have supported contribute to high rates of long term unemployment, many people would view politicians and government officials as benefactors. But this is one of the most significant flaws of such a program.The more people who view government as a benefactor, the less incentive they will have to produce the goods and services needed for a prosperous economy. Government is not a benevolent provider of everyone's needs; all the money it spends is coercively taken through taxes that come out of the income or wealth of those who are productive. The more it taxes the productive to benefit the unproductive, the more it discourages the hard work and innovation necessary to produce an abundance of goods and services to satisfy peoples' needs and wants.Another argument for a GMI is that technology is eliminating scarcity so that there is no longer enough work to be done by all those who are capable of producing goods and services. To the contrary, scarcity is as pervasive today as it has ever been. Although technology makes it possible to produce given quantities of goods and services with less labor, the lower cost of necessities such as food leaves people with more of their income to spend on other goods that they could not afford in the past such as travel, health care, education, sophisticated forms of entertainment and the like. Thus while the demand for labor to produce necessities has declined, the demand for labor to produce other goods and services has increased in an offsetting way.A guaranteed minimum income would reduce incentives to work even more than do current transfer programs such as unemployment compensation, AFDC, food stamps and Medicaid. Enough stigma and restrictions are associated with existing transfer programs that many low income people do not participate. Since all Americans would receive it, a GMI would reduce almost everyone's incentive to work. In particular, it would discourage people from doing the menial, unpleasant, and low paying jobs that are vital to economic prosperity.The key to economic prosperity and full employment is to reduce government spending on entitlement programs, not to add a new one. The associated reduction in taxes or government borrowing would increase the money available for investment in capital and job training, enabling more people to work and earn high wages so they could escape poverty and dependence on the government.Although it sounds enticing, a guaranteed minimum income is not the answer to reduce poverty.Dr. Tracy C. Miller is an associate professor of economics at Grove City College and fellow for economic theory and policy with The Center for Vision & Values. He holds a Ph.D. from University of Chicago."

        "webpage": "Interview with Gary Becker\nThe latest issue of the Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics has an interview with Gary Becker on the potentials and limitations of rational choice theory.\nAn interesting question:\nFollowing the crisis, many economists and methodologists have argued that more realistic behavioral underpinnings of economic theory would have made forecasts more accurate. Do you think that one of the things the recent crisis has shown us is that people just do not behave rationally? Or did the crisis rather show exactly the opposite - that people did in fact react to incentives and that the consequences of introducing new financial instruments were just not foreseeable? I think it is mainly the latter. There were incentives, both on the borrower and on the lender side, that these subprime loans would be made available at the lowest interest rates; and there was pressure from the government to do so; and probably those involved did not understand the financial instruments. Now, is it that we have to change our theories radically with respect to their behavioral structure or even switch to a new behavioral framework? There is very little evidence that would support such a move. There is a whole field of behavioral economics that I follow pretty closely, and parts of it I have even contributed to. But did the behavioral economists predict the crisis any better? When taking a look at the literature, one does not find better results. The rational choice model is an abstraction and as is the case with all abstractions and all theories from whatever discipline, say physics, you abstract from some things that sometimes may be important. And this is also true of the rational choice model. In terms of understanding the crisis, I do not think that more realistic behavioral assumptions would solve the problem. It has always been difficult in rational choice models to adequately account for the coordination of people's expectations. To some extent, the crisis involved the coordination of irrational expectations. This might be something we should think about and improve. With respect to how the crisis affects our models in terms of being based on a more realistic assumption structure: what will occur is that models become refined to help us understand what happened. But I do not see a fundamental change in the models with respect to the underlying structure of human behavior, nor do I see a need for such a change."

His appointment comes two weeks after Kodak revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an \"informal\" probe into the company's restatement of earnings from 2003 and 2004. In April, Kodak said accounting mistakes had led the company to overstate its 2004 profits by $93 million, and its 2003 profits by $12 million. And other bottom-line issues are looming. The troubled photography company, scrambling to keep up with the digital revolution, is also undergoing a massive restructuring that will eliminate as many as 25,000 by mid-2007. Requires Free Membership to View\nMore compliance coverage\nSOX accountants in demand\nSeven SOX tips for CIOs\nAsked about the connection between the SEC investigation and the new position, company spokesman David Lanzillo said there is \"no connection.\" The position is new, but its requirements have always been handled by Kodak's general counsel, he said.\nFor all its particular problems, Kodak is hardly alone in adding a CCO to its roster of top executives. The defense industry was ordered to get busy on compliance programs, following an era of financial and ethical abuses in the late 1980s. Financial services firms have long had compliance officers in place. Mutual funds are now required by the SEC to have compliance offices. And, while the office is not mandatory for most companies, the recent regulatory environment has convinced a much wider group of industries to hire compliance officers.\n\"If the Federal Sentencing Guidelines issued in November 1991 created the ethics profession, Sarbanes-Oxley created an entire industry,\" said Keith Darcy, executive director of the Ethics Officer Association (EOA), a not-for-profit based in Waltham, Mass.\nHelp wanted: Defining the CCO job Scott Cohen, editor and publisher of Compliance Week, dates the proliferation of CCOs to a 2002 speech by SEC commissioner Cynthia Glassman, in which she called on companies to designate a \"corporate responsibility officer.\" Many companies, including Boeing Co., Kodak, Sunoco Inc. and Walt Disney Co., heeded the call. \"At each company it means something slightly different. In some companies, that officer is involved in overseeing investigation of potential wrongdoing -- whistleblower provisions; in others, its compliance issues for the board,\" Cohen said.\nCohen, whose newsletter conducts a weekly interview with a CCO or person directly involved in compliance issues, said the duties of CCOs vary from industry to industry and training is \"all over the map.\" However, it's not uncommon for a CCO to have served as the company's general counsel. Sheller of Kodak, for example, worked for many years in Kodak's legal department; he will report to both Laurence Hickey, the corporate secretary and chief governance officer and to the audit company of the Kodak board of directors.\nWhile IT executives are rarely tapped for the job, Cohen said, compliance officers are increasingly involved with IT issues, citing the example of the CCO at Cendant, the New York real estate and travel services giant, Cohen said. \"Their chief compliance officer Richard Wolf, a lawyer, is overseeing a huge management records program, many millions of dollars, and some of it that you would traditionally think of as a CIO responsibility,\" Cohen said.\nBig perks, top salaries for CCOs\nEstablished in 1992, EOA has seen its membership double over the past five years, to 1,200, Darcy said. Companies are not only hiring, he said, but paying handsomely for compliance officers. A survey published this month by EOA in conjunction with Salary.com, a compensation data provider in Needham, Mass., shows that total compensation for the top compliance executives at large multinational companies is approaching $750,000.\n\"One corporate scandal after another has elevated this position to a much more prominent role. In most of these positions, the person is reporting to the board or the CEO,\" said Joseph Kilmartin, director of surveys at Salary.com.\nThe perks reflect that. \"In the case of the global ethics and compliance executive -- people responsible for worldwide operations -- you're looking at over $300,000 in stock options as the median in the market.\" The salary data, which includes long-term incentives, was derived from 109 companies. The survey also found that about 79% of these top executive have a law degree or a master's degree.\nCompliance strategies and best practices,\nchief customer officer (CCO)\nDoes your organization need a CCO?\nChief Compliance Officer: Top three responsibilities of a CCO\nCEO and others\nInvestment Company Act rule reduces liability for misled CCOs\nWhat does the chief customer officer (CCO) position really encompass?\nSun and Kodak settle Java lawsuit\ncontrol framework\nGRC (governance, risk management and compliance) software"

IFRS 9 introduces a new model for classification and measurement and impairment. The FASB is still deliberating. Key Developments Related to Classification and Measurement\nThe FASB proposed updated guidance for the classification and measurement of financial instruments in February 2013. However, as a result of significant negative feedback, the FASB has dramatically changed its proposal. As a result, convergence with the IASB will not be achieved. Equity investments (not accounted for under the equity method) with readily determinable fair values will be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, entities other than investment companies and broker-dealers will be afforded a practicability exception for investments that do not have readily determinable fair values. Such investments would be measured at cost less impairment and adjusted for observable prices. The accounting for debt investments (i.e., loans and debt securities) will remain unchanged subject to the new proposed impairment model (see below).\nThe unrestricted fair value option that currently exists in U.S. GAAP will be retained. Financial liabilities will generally be recorded at amortized cost unless the fair value is elected. If the fair value option is elected for a financial liability, adjustments to the value due to changes in instrument-specific credit risk will be recorded in other comprehensive income. The requirement to assess hybrid financial instruments for the need to bifurcate embedded derivatives from their host and account for them separately remains. To the extent that an embedded derivative must be bifurcated and accounted for separately, it will be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.

That is, they do not take into account the possibility that people value particular goods, services, or other determinants of well-being through comparisons with others. Robert Frank and Cass Sunstein have recently concluded that taking into account positional issues implies that the benefits of health and safety regulations may be twice as large as the levels commonly found in cost-benefit analyses. However, the effects of positional externalities on the valuation of safety and health regulations, and hence the correct modifications to cost-benefit analyses, are theoretically ambiguous. Frank and Sunstein assume that people like others to become worse off and that the incomes of others are more important for comparison than their health and safety on the job. Because different assumptions can lead to opposite conclusions about the value of additional regulations, this response addresses whether the evidence supports Frank and Sunstein's assumptions. The nature of relative position can be described as answers to three questions. First, what is the relevant group to which people compare themselves? Second, which characteristics of the comparison group matter? Third, how strongly do these comparisons affect people? This paper evaluates Frank and Sunstein's evidence on all three questions. People inclined to favor the model of positional externalities espoused by Frank and Sunstein may find their evidence convincing, but there are appealing alternative explanations. There is also direct evidence that only a minority of people act in the way they assume. They estimate that people should be willing to spend $6,000 of a $10,000 raise to prevent their coworkers from getting the same raise. Though some people might pay to reduce the salaries of their coworkers, others would surely pay to raise them. That many people display altruistic behavior in many situations is completely ignored by Frank and Sunstein. Particularly because of the variation in preferences across individuals, the evidence is at present too limited to permit the precise characterization necessary to evaluate the effects of policy. Under some plausible models, the policies suggested by Frank and Sunstein make people worse off; in others, better off. Though it is premature to incorporate positional externalities in policy analysis, such issues undoubtedly will become a formal part of policy analysis as our understanding improves.

Bernanke Defends Fed Bond Buying\nProgram will spur growth and cut unemployment, Fed chairman says.\nBy Jeff Kearns and Craig Torres, Bloomberg October 2, 2012 \u2022 Reprints\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke defended the Federal Reserve's unprecedented bond buying in his first comments since the Fed renewed the purchases last month, saying the program will spur growth, cut unemployment, help savers and support the dollar.\nThe central bank will sustain record stimulus even after the expansion gains strength, and policy makers don't expect the economy to remain weak through 2015, Bernanke said today in a speech in Indianapolis. The U.S. probably won't fall back into a recession even with growth too weak to reduce a jobless rate stuck above 8 percent since February 2009, he said in response to an audience question.\n\"We expect the economy to continue to grow,\" Bernanke said to the Economic Club of Indiana. \"Our concern is not really a recession. Our concern is that growth will continue but at a pace that's insufficient to put people back to work.\"\nBernanke, 58, stood behind his unconventional policies by saying the late Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman \"would have supported what we are doing.\" The Federal Open Market Committee said last month it will keep the main interest rate near zero until at least mid-2015 and buy $40 billion of mortgage debt a month in a third round of quantitative easing until the labor market shows \"sustained improvement.\"\n\"We expect that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economy strengthens,\" Bernanke said in the speech. Still, policy makers' forecast for the main interest rate \"doesn't mean that we expect the economy to be weak through\" mid-2015, Bernanke said.\nWhile payrolls are expanding, economic growth of 1.5 percent to 2 percent \"is not fast enough to lower the unemployment rate\" because it only keeps up with the number of new entrants into the labor force, he said.\nCentral bank policies to boost growth should not damage the value of the dollar on foreign currency markets, Bernanke said. The dollar \"is about where it was before the crisis,\" and pursuing maximum employment and low and stable inflation will make the U.S. currency attractive, he said.\nAlso, Fed easing, including the zero-interest-rate policy, will help savers by fueling the expansion, Bernanke said. \"Only a strong economy can create higher asset values and sustainably good returns for savers.\"\nBernanke, a scholar of the Great Depression, has deployed the most aggressive monetary policies since the Fed's founding nearly a century ago as he battled the financial crisis, helped pull the nation out of the worst recession since the 1930s and sought to keep the expansion going.\nMore Assets\nBernanke expanded the balance sheet to $2.8 trillion from around $877 billion in August 2007. He also changed the composition of the Fed's balance sheet, purchasing mortgage-backed securities to help lower yields for housing finance.\nThe Fed has taken \"very much to heart\" the conclusions of Friedman and Anna Schwartz, whose 1963 book, \"A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960,\" said the Depression was triggered by monetary tightening and the collapse of the banking system, Bernanke said.\n\"We were aggressive early on, we didn't allow the fact that interest rates were very low to fool us into thinking that monetary policy was as accommodative as it needed to be, and we were aggressive, as you know, in trying to prevent the collapse of the banking system,\" Bernanke said. \"Those are all things that Friedman would have supported.\"\nBernanke's reference to Friedman aligns with decades of his research into monetary policy during the Depression. He once called a proper understanding of the Great Depression \"the Holy Grail of macroeconomics.\"\nIn a book of essays on the economy of the 1930s published in 2000, Bernanke embraced much of Friedman and Schwartz's methodology while developing his own theories on the impact of credit on the duration and magnitude of business cycles.\nAs a Fed governor in 2002, Bernanke told Friedman during a speech: \"Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.\"\nBernanke applied his own scholarship and the analysis of Friedman and Schwartz to the financial crisis.

        "webpage": "Thursday, February 04, 2016\n\nItaly and the euro crisis\n\nGreece may be the starkest example, but it is not the only country facing overlapping crises. It is not even the most important one facing this dilemma. That would be Italy. While Rome's problems are different from those of Greece, the country's long-term sustainability in the eurozone is just as uncertain, unless you believe that its economic performance will miraculously improve when there is no reason why it should.\n\nItaly was overwhelmed by the increase of refugees from north Africa last year. On top of that it faces unresolved economic problems  -  no productivity growth for 15 years; a large stock of public sector debt that leaves the government with virtually no fiscal room for manoeuvre; and a banking system with \u20ac200bn in non-performing loans, plus another \u20ac150bn of debt classified as troubled. Then consider that its three main opposition parties have, at one time or another, all questioned the country's membership of the eurozone. Even if none of them look like coming to power in the near future, it is clear that Italy only has a limited amount of time to fix its multiple problems.\n\nM\u00fcnchau notes that Italy's leadership is being open in its criticism of the EU under Angela Merkel's rule: \"There are signs that Italy's patience with the EU and Germany, in particular, is wearing thin . Matteo Renzi, prime minister, has been openly attacking the policies of the EU on energy, on Russia, on the fiscal deficits, as well as German dominance of the entire apparatus.\"\n\nBut I have to admit I'm puzzled by his concluding paragraph: \"There is an element of bad luck in this. Europe's policy of muddling through, of doing the minimum required, and hoping to mop up the rubble later, might even have worked if the refugees had stayed at home. The EU's mistake was not to have chosen a path that would lead to invariable ruin, but to render itself defenceless against the next unforeseen shock.\"\n\nI can't even figure out what he's trying to say with the last sentence. Does he mean it would have been okay \"to have chosen a path that would lead to invariable ruin\" if they had just left themselves a bit more flexibility for the next bump in the road that would require more muddling through? That \"invariable ruin\" wouldn't be quite so bad if it were delayed a bit?\n\nThe increasing pressure of the refugee problem no doubt made the EU's situation more complicated in 2015. But that acute phase was also a result of previous muddling through on the refugee crisis which had actually been going on for years. It's not unusual for politicians to overblow real crises or gin up phony ones for other purposes. But the refugee problem has been a visible crisis for years, while Merkel and the rest of the EU just didn't come up with good solutions. And still haven't.\n\nI'm sorry to see that M\u00fcnchau will no longer be providing a weekly column for Spiegel Online, as he notes in his final installment, Langsames Dahinsiechen 29.01.2016.\n\nThere he explains that he expects the EU will not collapse in a rapid and dramatic fashion. But rather that it will decay away, with \"periphery\" countries dropping off and a core of the wealthiest countries remaining:\n\n[Even with the best will, a solution to our permanent crises would be difficult, because to coordinate them assumes a commonality of interests. It's more likely that the various crises will run their course and that we will absorb their negative social and economic consequences with the Whisk broom of political-economic emergency measures.\n\nIn the course of these developments, along with the end of Schengen and the shrinking of the euro area, {we are} threatened as well with a collapse of income, an impoverishment of the middle class and with a consequent political radicalization. That doesn't unquestionably threaten democracy as such, but it certainly does the agreements and institutions that cross national borders. It is not a good environment for European integration and international cooperation and coordination. The EU will thereby not collapse spectacularly, but rather tatter along the edges and hollow out in the center.]\n\nI'm not at all confident that a crackup of the eurozone will be so minimally dramatic.

        "webpage": "New Campaign By NASD Foundation to Provide Financial Education Tools and Training to Military\nRelease Date: 2/16/2006 Washington, D.C. -- The NASD Investor Education Foundation today launched a comprehensive new campaign to deliver financial education tools and training to members of the military and their spouses. The campaign is designed to help military personnel and their families manage their money with confidence by providing financial education programs, information and publications, as well as a new Web site -- SaveAndInvest.org. Many servicemembers report having difficulty covering expenses and saving for the future. Research conducted in June 2005 found that only 29 percent of military personnel who currently invest received a passing grade on a quiz about basic financial knowledge. However, 58 percent of survey respondents said that it was very important to them that they become more knowledgeable about saving and investing. Sixty-two percent indicated that they plan to increase their investment levels in the next year.\n\"We know that military personnel want and need objective, unbiased information to help them make sound financial decisions,\" said Robert R. Glauber, Chairman of the NASD Investor Education Foundation, who also serves as Chairman and CEO of NASD. \"The NASD Foundation is pleased to launch our new campaign to provide financial training and tools to military families and to be working in this effort with the Department of Defense and all branches of the military.\" The Foundation, through partnerships with organizations already working with the military community, will provide financial training programs for spouses as well as for on-base financial counselors. The Foundation will also fund the development of publications and resources aimed at providing military personnel with information relevant to their unique needs and lifestyles. A new Web site, SaveAndInvest.org, will cater to the military community and provide useful tools and up-to-date information.\n\"Family separations resulting from duty stations changes and deployments away from home often put additional financial stress on military families,\" said Mary Schapiro, a member of the Foundation's Board of Directors and also Vice-Chairman of NASD. \"Given the fact that military families are often on the move, we are committed to making sure servicemembers and their spouses have access to easy-to-use tools and financial education materials wherever they are.\"\n\"Financial preparedness is a key component of military readiness,\" said David S.C. Chu, Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. \"Equipping servicemembers with the tools and resources they need to make sound financial decisions is integral to both military readiness and the strength and stability of our service members and their families.\" The Foundation's military financial education programs are being funded by fines levied against First Command Financial Planning, Inc. for misleading sales practices related to the sale of systematic investment plans to military personnel. Over $5 million in restitution was paid to individual investors and the remaining funds are being used to fund education and training programs for military personnel and their families.\nThe NASD Foundation has joined forces with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Military Family Association (NMFA), the Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education (AFCPE), the InCharge Education Foundation, the National Endowment for Financial Education, the American Savings Education Council, CincHouse.com and the Consumer Federation of America to develop programs, provide training, and distribute information and resources to the military community. Program and services are aimed at both servicemembers and their spouses.\n\"Our collaboration with the NASD Investor Education Foundation will expand and enhance the opportunities we offer our military families,\" said Tanna Schmidli, NMFA Chairman of the Board. \"With their support, we have worked with the AFCPE to launch the Military Spouse Fellowship for the Accredited Financial Counselor\" program. This wonderful Fellowship will provide spouses with the education necessary for entry into the financial counseling and education field. We have already seen tremendous interest in the program and look forward to implementing the Fellowship with great success.\"\nThe NASD Investor Education Foundation, established in 2003, supports innovative research and educational projects that give investors the tools they need to better understand the markets and the basic principles of saving and investing. The Foundation has awarded more than $3.7 million in grants for educational programs and research projects targeting the underserved segments of the population.

Schizer told Reunion 2012 guests this past summer, but stimulus efforts are extremely challenging to execute effectively. Dean Schizer, who was joined on the panel by Stephen Friedman '62, Peter C. Canellos '67, Professor Michael J. Graetz, and Rebecca Kysar of Brooklyn Law School, added that reforming our housing and mortgage markets, as well as entitlement programs and the tax code, would represent moves in the right direction.\n\"No single step will do the trick,\" Dean Schizer said in assessing the challenges that lie ahead, including massive budget deficits and an increasingly global economy.\nEach panelist joining Dean Schizer for the discussion suggested a different approach to reform, including Graetz's support for a national consumption tax, and Friedman's call for more effective, easier-to-understand regulation.\nBad risk management on the part of financial institutions was a major factor in the financial crisis, said Friedman, who is chairman of the private equity firm Stone Point Capital. He added that regulation is crucial to ensuring the stability of the financial system.\nDespite the more than $860 billion that the federal government has spent to stimulate the economy, the dean noted that the U.S. saw only a 1.5 percent growth in 2011. The country's $1.3 trillion deficit, he said, is approximately 11 percent of the country's gross domestic product, and roughly 13 million Americans are out of work. While there may be no simple answers or easily achieved panaceas waiting around the corner, Dean Schizer concluded by noting that deficit reduction and economic stimulation are both vital to economic recovery. \"The deficit will decline only if the economy starts to grow,\" he said."

Deal to Raise Revenue on Foreign Income Gets Closer\nBipartisan deal could make it easier for U.S. companies to bring home foreign income that has been taxed elsewhere.\nBy Richard Rubin, Bloomberg February 28, 2013\nLawmakers are starting to see the outlines of a bipartisan agreement on how to tax the income that U.S.-based corporations earn outside the country.\nSuch a system would make it easier for U.S. companies to bring home foreign income that has been taxed elsewhere while preventing profits booked in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions from receiving the same benefit.\nA deadlock-breaking agreement would respond to companies including Procter & Gamble Co. and General Electric Co. that have lobbied for change and complain that the U.S. tax code hurts their ability to compete globally. Under the current system, fewer than 100 companies have stockpiled more than $1.2 trillion in untaxed profits outside the U.S.\n\"There has been a lot of thinking and work done on these issues over the last couple of years, and I do think that has brought the parties closer together,\" said Michael Mundaca, who was a senior Treasury Department tax official in the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\nThe potential framework is conceptual, not the product of negotiations or the detailed bill-writing that would need to occur. An agreement on international taxation would probably happen only as part of a broader rewrite of the tax code. That is months if not years away and locked in a partisan dispute over how much revenue the government should collect.\nJacob J. Lew, the new Treasury secretary, told senators during the confirmation process that he saw the potential for agreement on international taxation.\n\"There is considerable debate as to how to reform the international tax system,\" Lew wrote in response to a question from Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the panel's top Republican. \"But I believe that there is common ground on this subject, including a mutual concern about preserving the U.S. tax base by reducing incentives that encourage the shifting of investment and income overseas.\"\nSenate Finance Committee members Rob Portman and Ron Wyden both said in interviews this week that they see room for a potential compromise.\nThrough meetings with Lew and his predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, Portman said he's seen more acceptance by the Obama administration of the current system's disadvantages for U.S. companies. Portman, an Ohio Republican, said lawmakers could agree on a system that exempts foreign income along with rules that prevent companies from shifting profits outside the U.S.\n\"You can do that,\" he said in an interview. \"Other countries have done it, so I think there's a growing consensus around this.\"\nThe debate is between what tax analysts call worldwide tax systems and territorial tax systems.\nThe U.S. system is nominally worldwide, meaning that companies with U.S. headquarters owe taxes on all of the income they earn around the world. They can receive credits for taxes paid to foreign governments and can defer U.S. taxation until they bring the money home.\nThat system gives U.S. companies an incentive to shift profits outside the country and park them there, a trend that has accelerated as companies expand their markets overseas.\n\"We believe the U.S. tax system needs to be reformed to close loopholes, to lower the corporate rate and to provide a territorial system like virtually all other major industrialized countries,\" GE spokesman Seth Martin said in a statement. \"American companies need to be able to compete on a level playing field with their foreign competitors.\"\nGE has $108 billion outside the U.S.\nThe cash buildup has created pressure on companies such as Apple Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. to seek legislative changes or find more productive uses for the money.

Black homeownership has declined. Black joblessness is up. Black income is down.As the conferees gathered, the government released new figures showing the black unemployment rate at 13.8 percent, nearly double the 7.0 percent for whites. The overall jobless rate is 7.9 percent.As bleak as the economic picture is for black Americans, the immediate prospects for improving it are worse, many participants said. They agreed that chances are remote for the kind of aggressive, targeted action needed to combat those problems and close the economic disparities that have long separated blacks and whites.\"We are basically talking about an economic system that is shot through with discrimination,\" said Bernard a former assistant secretary of labor.Despite that, Anderson and others said, President Obama seems reluctant to attack economic disparities between blacks and whites head-on.Anderson said that Obama's second inaugural address was notable for lifting up gay rights, sounding the call for immigration reform and signaling his determination for women to receive equal pay in the workplace. \"But there was not a single, blessed word on race,\" he said.Anderson said that he has met with Obama's economic advisers in years past but did not get the sense that they were interested in any racially targeted economic remedies. \"He does not want to be labeled a president who is consumed by racial inequality in this country,\" Anderson said.Others at the conference said that Obama took office during the worst downturn since the Great Depression and had his hands full forging policies to keep the economy from a full meltdown.Meanwhile, administration officials have pointed out that the president's policies have led to 35 consecutive months of private-sector job growth and more than 6 million new jobs. They also note that the president's work to expand Pell Grants and extend the earned-income and child tax credits have helped millions of African Americans.Nonetheless, conferees said that more needs to be done to close the racial disparities that have long been a feature of the nation's economic life.During the depths of the crisis, Obama often said he wanted to build a better, more durable economy in the recovery. Conference participants said they are challenging him to live up to his word.\"We would all like to see him pursue that course,\" said RalphEverette, president and chief executive of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which co-sponsored the event.Several scholars offered far-reaching, if politically unlikely, policy prescriptions.Duke University professor William Darity said policymakers should pursue a large-scale public jobs program to dramatically lower unemployment. Darrick Hamilton, an economist at the New School, said the government should divert some of the money used to fund the income-tax deduction for mortgage interest to fund \"baby bonds\" that would provide $15,000 for disadvantaged newborns of any race to invest later in higher education, a business or a home.The remedies need to be bold because \"racial disparities are persistent and they are ubiquitous,\" said Enrique Lopezlira, a lecturer at Howard. \"It is hard to explain in a context that does not include some sort of institutional racism going on.\"\nStory tags \" \u2022 Jobs \u2022 Unemployment \u2022 Racism\nRichard Sherman 2.0, equally effective with less bravado Police join forces to fight property crime"

        "webpage": "New historical perspective on Irish economy February 24th, 2011 in Other Sciences / Economics & Business Susan Flavin, a PhD student in the Department of Historical Studies, studied Bristol customs accounts and port books to investigate the range of commodities that were imported into Ireland from Bristol towards the end of the sixteenth century. She found that there was a dramatic increase in the range and volume of luxury goods imported: from just 60 basic items in 1503 to almost 400 by 1600. These findings are surprising because Ireland in the 16th century, which is still seen by economic historians as a colonial backwater, is a very unlikely place to find significant changes of this nature. (It is widely accepted that the 'birth' of a consumer society in Britain did not occur until the 18th century, in line with growing industrialisation and commercialisation.) The customs accounts and port books of Bristol are an outstandingly detailed record of Anglo-Irish trade, recording in minute detail what was the most important branch of Ireland's overseas trade. The records are particularly invaluable because the public records office in Dublin was destroyed in 1922. No other economic records of equivalent value survive in Ireland, or elsewhere, for examining the country's economic development during this period.\nThe nature of the Irish economy in the sixteen century meant that Ireland remained dependent on imports for the vast majority of every-day goods; the accounts therefore paint a very detailed picture of the evolving nature of Irish material culture and of changing patterns of consumption.\nBy examining the custom accounts, Susan Flavin found that growth occurred in two main areas: the increasing diversification of product types (buttons, for example, evolved from a single category to a large range of subtypes) and the appearance of entirely new items such as soap and spectacles, an increasing variety of luxury European cloth and foods, and a range of items described as being specifically for children.\nHowever, while one might expect the growing range of luxury items to reflect increasing wealth in Irish society, the overall value of the Bristol-Ireland trade seems to have collapsed at the same time as luxury imports increased. It seems that while the variety and, in some cases, the volume of small luxury items was going up, there was a corresponding fall in staple goods such as broad cloth, saffron and raw silk, which together made up the largest part of the gross value of import trade in the first half of the century.\nIn order to understand this dichotomy, Flavin examined Ireland's exports, in addition to its imports (the accounts record both), and found evidence of well-developed Irish mercantile contacts with Spain. For example, in 1594 Irish merchants exported four times more Spanish hat wool to England than they did Irish wool, and by 1600, Seville oil made up 11 per cent of Irish exports to Bristol. This suggests that Irish merchants were being increasingly drawn towards European markets, which would partly explain the decreasing value of Ireland's trade with England.\nSusan Flavin said: \"My research does not suggest that 16th century Ireland showed all or even many of the features of a modern consumer society, or that it underwent a 'consumer revolution' of the type claimed by historians of 18th century Britain. Nevertheless, analysis of the Bristol customs data points to a dramatic shift in the nature of Irish consumption by the last quarter of the 16th century, indicating both a growing sophistication of tastes and an increasing prosperity in Ireland.\" More information: 'Consumption and material culture in sixteenth-century Ireland' by Susan Flavin in Economic History Review (2010)Provided by University of Bristol \"New historical perspective on Irish economy.\" February 24th, 2011."

It is the clearest illustration yet that a great deal more needs to be done to restore standards in banking.\"While the commission supported the creation of a ringfence between retail and investment banking operations, they warned the current proposals did not go far enough and regulators should be given the power to break up banks that try to circumvent the rules.Today's report says: \"Additional powers are essential to provide adequate incentives for the banks to comply not just with the rules of the ringfence, but also with their spirit.\"In the absence of the commission's legislative proposals to electrify the ringfence, the risk that the ringfence will eventually fail will be much higher.\"Tyrie says that the proposals, as they stand, fall well short of what is required. \"Over time, the ring-fence will be tested and challenged by the banks. Politicians, too, could succumb to lobbying from banks and others, adding to pressure to put holes in the ring-fence.\"For the ring-fence to succeed, banks need to be discouraged from gaming the rules. All history tells us they will do this unless incentivised not to.\"That's why we recommend electrification. The legislation needs to set out a reserve power for separation; the regulator needs to know he can use it. \"Furthermore, we need periodic reviews of the sector to reassure us that the ring-fence as a whole is working. Tougher measures may yet be required.\"According to the Treasury, the cost to banks of separating their retail and investment arms could run at between \u00a31.7 billion and \u00a34.4bn a year, with one-off \"transitional\" costs of up to \u00a32.5bn, although the commission notes that some witnesses who gave evidence argued that the final figures could be higher.However, the costs are far lower than the government has spent propping up the banking sector since the financial crisis erupted in 2007. Treasury figures show the outstanding taxpayer support stood at \u00a3228bn as of March 2012, down from a peak of \u00a31.2 trillion.During his appearance before the commission, Lloyds chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said that ring-fencing \"enhances the credibility of recovery and resolution mechanisms because it provides...a separation between retail and investment banking\".Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins - who replaced Bob Diamond following the Libor scandal - said banks should be able to separate their retail and investment operations without affecting their ability to lend. However, other banks were less certain, with RBS chief executive Stephen Hester telling parliamentarians that he did not believe the move would produce \"any safety benefits to the financial system or the UK\", while Peter Sands, chief executive of Standard Chartered, argued that \"it will not deliver a stability benefit, and it will be more expensive\".Next year the commission will look at areas such as competition, corporate governance and role of civil and criminal law in enhancing banking standards, and Tyrie said: \"It is essential that banks are restructured in such a way that allows them to fail, whether inside or outside the ringfence.\" Comments"

        "webpage": "Wall Street survives one storm but now faces another\n12 November 2012,\nNow that Wall Street's huge bet on presidential candidate Mitt Romney has failed, banks face four more years of a less than sympathetic ear in the Oval Office. Blackout: the skyline of lower Manhattan mostly in darkness except for the Goldman Sachs building after a power outage caused by Hurricane Sandy The world's major capital market banks are in bad shape. They are trading well below book value, were recently downgraded and the majority of them have failed for more than two years to earn a return on equity greater than its cost.\nSeven of the top 10 banks have had chief executive changes since 2009, three of these being made \"effective immediately\".\nAnd the hallowed big-bank business model is broken: witness the abandonment by Swiss giant UBS of its global trading business which will eliminate 10,000 jobs over the next three years.\nCapital market banks face three especially tough issues that will shape their future during the next presidential term.\nThe cost of federal aid to the disaster areas and the plight of millions hit by Hurricane Sandy will complicate the issue but make it especially hard for the Republicans to be heartless.\nBarack Obama's re-election suggests that compromises acceptable to him will have to be made by House Republicans but no doubt they will still make it a cliffhanger. Perhaps a balance can be found by eliminating some further tax deductions for the wealthy. But balancing the budget is likely to have to wait until economic recovery is achieved.\nStuck at the bottom of the cycle\nWall Street badly needs recovery in transactional activity in capital markets. New issues have been weak in equities, derivatives and mergers, but especially so in sovereign debt and mortgage-backed securities. Many market participants, both issuers and investors, have been sitting still for years waiting for uncertainty to be removed in tax, energy, healthcare and other areas.\nPresident Obama is likely to refresh his economic team and appoint a new Treasury Secretary with some speed. Jacob Lew, Obama's chief of staff and former chief operating officer at Citigroup Alternative Investments, is the early favourite. The old team had run out of ideas, and perhaps was too focused on income inequality to do much to remove business bottlenecks. There is little indication, however, that much will change with these new appointments and the bottlenecks will remain; a disappointment for Wall Street.\nEven so, Wall Street's usual ability to innovate has been noticeably absent. A vast array of derivative products, for example, was developed over the past decade to help traders and investors around the world manage and transfer risk. In the 1980s, mortgage-backed bonds and interest-rate swaps were developed to help savings and loan organisations through the systemic crisis they then faced.\nToday, capital has to be returned to the mortgage industry, risk has to be transferred away from systemically important banks, pension funds everywhere need overhauling, and federal and state debt needs to be restructured. But Wall Street, burdened by its own troubles, hasn't come up with much in the way of solutions. It is not helping itself.\nStructural and reputational issues\nPowerful government regulatory actions such as Dodd-Frank, Vickers' banking reforms in the UK and the \"Swiss finish\" on capital requirements, together with Basel III and widespread downgrades by rating agencies will severely affect systemically important firms.\nThis will require several to make major adjustments to their business models. Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, UBS, and Barclays have already begun to adjust theirs under new, post-crisis leaderships. The industry that gorged itself on trading profits for a decade has already been thrown on a crash diet.\nRisk-weighted assets have been cut back, sometimes substantially, along with thousands of traders and support personnel that went with them.\nMost of the laid-off traders will try to resurface in hedge funds or other \"shadow banks\", but many of these are suffering performance problems and may not have much room.\nLooking ahead, banks must deal with the important details of the Volcker Rule, derivatives trading and other of the many Dodd-Frank rules that still have not been implemented.\nWall Street also must continue to struggle with massive reputational damage, which has been both aggravated and kept alive by an endless stream of litigation (often requiring expensive settlements) that has greatly limited its influence with clients, regulators and investors, and impaired its ability to return to \"normal\", something it greatly desires.\nObama may in time disband the task force he created at the justice department charged with \"bringing those responsible for the financial crisis to justice\", but there seems to be no hurry. In any case, the litigation fever has spread well beyond the federal realm to other agencies, regulators and state officials.\nAll in all, there is still a great deal for bankers to worry about. But just as great devastating natural disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy, often bring a shared spirit of unified effort to do the right thing, so Wall Street's long history of surviving both natural and man-made storms should see it through.\n-- Roy C Smith is a finance professor at NYU Stern School of Business\nMore from Comment\nBrexit debate in dire need of serious long-term thinking\nLetter From Jerez: Time is against this town and its most famous product\nMost Read on Financial News"

        "webpage": "Repent, You Lazy Spendthrift!\nDavid Brooks has a 'Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God' Moment\nBy Elinore Longobardi\nA Debit to The New York Times for David Brooks's column identifying America's spending habits as a \"moral\" problem, and attributing to that moral failing not only the credit crisis, but also class inequality.\nWe give columnists considerable leeway here at The Audit, because they are entitled to their opinions, whether or not we share them. But a poorly reasoned argument is just that, even in an opinion piece.\nThe fundamental problem here is that Brooks is more theological than logical. He doesn't so much analyze our current economic condition as chastise us for self-imposed exile from that American Eden of hard work and frugality.\nAnd so, typical for a story about a fall from grace, we first glimpse the good old days, when there was plenty of righteousness to go around. The Puritans and Benjamin Franklin parade by, trailing the expected virtues in their wake: hard work, temperance, frugality.\nThanks to this solid foundation, and a chorus of faithful parents, teachers, preachers and newspaper editors who spread the gospel of right-living, America was wealthy but unsullied for 200 years. The United States has been an affluent nation since its founding. But the country was, by and large, not corrupted by wealth. For centuries, it remained industrious, ambitious and frugal.\nBut, alas, no longer:\nOver the past 30 years, much of that has been shredded. The social norms and institutions that encouraged frugality and spending what you earn have been undermined. The institutions that encourage debt and living for the moment have been strengthened.\nWe get a hint here that perhaps debauched individuals did not bring on this crisis all by themselves, but Brooks goes on to assure us that while there have been many \"agents of destruction\" in our midst, we must ultimately look to ourselves.\nThis column is a case of adding insult to injury. Americans' wages are stagnant. The costs of living are rising. Home-values are falling. Hundreds of thousands are being put out of their homes thanks in large part to the chicanery surrounding subprime lending. Now they get to listen to Brooks accuse them of moral turpitude.\nThe Brooksian theory of cultural decline is based on assertion alone. There is no evidence to support it - or at least none is offered. Evidence of structural changes in the financial-services sector over the last three decades, on the other hand, is abundant. These changes, by the way, were driven by the financial-services industry itself for its own considerable benefit. Rather than probe these, Brooks blames individuals (with a nod at the bottom to the \"role\" the real culprits like payday lenders have played).\nIt's disingenuous for him to blame high debt levels on excessive discretionary spending but it's worse to blame such spending for class inequality.\nThere has been a moral failure here, but the average American is not to blame. The burden for that falls on institutions like Countrywide and Bear Stearns.\nIndeed, Benjamin Franklin would not approve.\nElinore Longobardi is a Fellow and staff writer of The Audit, the business-press section of Columbia Journalism Review."

The survey covered 18 of the 35 top retail banks in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific, collectively referred to as \"premier-league\" banks.\nThe survey found that the operationally strongest retail banks in the premier league outperform their peers financially. Banks that excelled on a wide range of operational measurements had low cost-to-income ratios (CIRs), a key measure of efficiency and profitability. The leading financial performers achieved top ranking in at least two, and frequently three, of the four levers of operational excellence identified by BCG.\nThe survey also revealed that the operating models of the premier-league banks as a whole have become more productive. The banks achieved these efficiency gains even as they focused more staff time and resources on meeting the needs of customers.\nThe leading banks exhibited five key trends in the way they improved their operations, the survey found. All five trends contribute in some fashion to enhancing customer services. The trends are: strengthening the customer experience, increasing sales performance, improving end-to-end productivity, enhancing organizational efficiency, and reducing complexity.\n\"Customer-centricity has been seen as a best practice for a number of years,\" said Robert Sims, a partner in BCG's Toronto office and coauthor of the report. \"But now -- in the 'new new normal' environment -- it has become absolutely essential as far as the world's top banks are concerned.\"\nThe drive for customer-centricity was exemplified by operational changes made by premier-league banks to reduce the number and complexity of their products, the survey found. Offering fewer products and making them easier to understand minimizes customer confusion and also simplifies bank operations.\nAt the same time, the leading banks have improved data-mining techniques -- allowing them to create more personalized customer services while improving sales performance.\nCustomers, meanwhile, have become more demanding, expecting banks to provide simplified interaction processes across multiple channels, when and where the customer prefers. For banks, providing a truly integrated multichannel customer offering is now just the minimum table stakes in the competition to win business, the research found.\n\"Taken together, the findings demonstrate how capable and resilient the world's leading retail banks are,\" said Michael Grebe, a partner in BCG's Munich office and coauthor of the report. \"In today's challenging financial-services environment, that is a rare positive message.\"\nA copy of the report can be downloaded at .\nTo arrange an interview with one of the authors, please contact Eric Gregoire at +1 617 850 3701 or .\nAbout The Boston Consulting Group\nThe Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a global management consulting firm and the world's leading advisor on business strategy.

The Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Mr. Kittiratt Na-Ranong, said that the foreign currency exchange rates remain stable and are not a factor leading to inflationary pressure. Thailand's capital market also enjoys stability. Although crude oil prices in the world market have increased, he said, the Government believed that it would be able to maintain retail oil prices. If necessary, it might use money from the Oil Fund to maintain domestic retail oil prices. The Oil Fund's red figures have been reduced from more than 30 billion baht to 16 billion baht.\nApart from accelerating public sector spending, Mr. Kittiratt said that the Government had instructed relevant agencies to seek new export markets to replace the European Union. The new markets include ASEAN, the Middle East, and East Asia.\nHe said that the unemployment rate in Thailand was still low. However, labor skills needed to be developed in response to the labor market demand. In this connection, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Education were told to promote skill development by providing training for workers.\nIn order to enable the tourism sector to earn more income, Mr. Kittiratt said that Don Mueang Airport will be reopened for services on 1 August 2012, instead of 1 October 2012. The reopening of Don Mueang will facilitate the movement of passengers and ease congestion at Suvarnabhumi Airport. According to a recent Cabinet decision, Suvarnabhumi will be a hub airport for full-service and connecting flights, while Don Mueang will serve low-cost carriers and accommodate both domestic and point-to-point international flights.\nAnother measure to help Thailand to cope with the eurozone crisis is that the Government will place emphasis on three groups of products to prevent them from being adversely affected. The three groups, which have been exported mainly to Europe, include textiles and garment, gems and jewelry, and electronics items. Financial institutions under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance will be asked to extend credit, or provide guarantee, for exports to target countries.\nThe Export-Import Bank of Thailand has prepared 100 billion baht in credit for entrepreneurs and another 40 billion baht in credit guarantee for exports. The funds will help in risk management for exports to Europe.\nRelated stories in this category\nGrowth of Thai and European Businesses\nThailand's Economic Growth Forecast\nFree Trade Agreement Fund Helps Thai Farmers Cope with Trade Liberalization\nRanong Province Prepares to Become an Export Center in the Andaman Sea\nEconomic Outlook for 2014\nForeign Office, The Government Public Relations Department, Office of the Prime Minister\n9 Rama VI Road, Soi 30, Bangkok 10400, Thailand Tel: (+66-2) 618-2323 ext. 1700, 1707 Fax : (+66-2) 618-2358 E-mail :  9049221"

        "webpage": "The economy: where the parties stand\nBy Emma Griffiths and Lyndal Curtis\nFri 16 Aug 2013, 9:00 AM AEST\nEconomic data concludes households are better off than 10 years ago\nNothing is more central to politics than the economy, and in this election Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott have both put it at the core of their bid to win office. It is at the centre of the policies and promises of the parties and politicians that Australians will vote for on September 7.Management of the economy can make or break a government, render an opposition irrelevant or give it a powerful weapon. For voters, it determines the standard of living: jobs, housing, access to healthcare and education, infrastructure and the environment. To use the phrase coined by one of Bill Clinton's advisers, it really is all about \"the economy, stupid\".What aspects of economic policy do the parties agree on?The ALP and the Coalition both aim for continued economic growth, job creation and low interest rates. Both talk about the challenges the Australian economy faces with a continued high Australian dollar and the benefits for growth that come from a rising Asian middle class. However, listening to the rhetoric, the major parties agree on almost nothing.\nMore on the  of living weighs on minds of AustraliansHow does Canada deal with its infrastructure issues?Australia risks squandering expat expertiseFarmers losing out as miners lure labourersHousing recovery easier said than doneSurvey shows modest growth in grocery pricesIs Ford's failure a blessing for Geelong?Services industry adapts to end of mining boomABC Rural looks at the regional economy What are the key differences between the major parties?The key point of disagreement is the strength of the Australian economy.The ALP points to continued growth, low inflation, low unemployment and low interest rates as well as comparisons with other OECD economies, particularly those in the US and Europe, as a sign of Australia's continued economic strength in the wake of the global financial crisis. Labor argues that its strategy of stimulating the economy during the GFC saved Australia from the worst of the crisis.The Coalition's main line of attack on the economy is based on the mantra of \"debt and deficit\". It says the rise in debt over this government's first four budgets has been bigger as a share of GDP than over any other four year period since at least 1970, when the historical records in modern budget papers began. It believes comparisons should be made with countries in the region instead of the US and Europe. It blames the Labor government's stimulus packages, and a continuing high spend, for pushing Australia's debt to unsustainable levels. It also contrasts Labor's repeated deficit budgets with the former Coalition government's run of surplus budgets.\nWhat we knowEconomic growthThe Government's latest budget figures have forecast a growth rate of 2.5 per cent in 2013-14 and 3 per cent in 2014-15.The Coalition says it will boost economic growth through \"living within our means\", lower taxes and boosting productivity. Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said in February: \"I am confident that should there be a change of government later in the year, there will be an instantaneous adrenalin charge in our economy.\" (CEDA speech 15/2/13)The Greens economic policy states: \"While government finances must be sustainable over the long-term, it is appropriate to stimulate the economy during economic downturns and save during economic booms. Government financing should be responsibly managed so as to minimise intergenerational debt.\"DebtThe ALP points to international comparisons on Australia's public debt levels and says has very low debt levels by international standards. All three major ratings agencies - Fitch, Standard and Poors and Moody's - have given Australia's Government a AAA credit rating. The economic statement revealed net debt would peak at 13 per cent next financial year and drop to 12 per cent by 2016-17.The Coalition says the size and growth of public debt in Australia is perhaps the economy's greatest vulnerability. As part of its promise to \"get the budget back under control\" it has promised to start paying off debt. It has also called for no further increase to the $300 billion debt limit.The Greens state that Australia has very low public debt, and while they support bringing the budget back to surplus over the economic cycle, they also argue that Australia needs to invest in educati"
